       Opening prayer by Brother Lambert:
        (Part of prayer is missing, as tape could not be repaired) …In our hearts the good word of
       God. And Lord we just pray that you’ll just water the word in our hearts this morning. To help us
       to know you better, may we leave here more strengthened and more encouraged and more
       determined to be on fire for thee. Father we thank you for the Holy Spirit moving in the hearts of
       your children here this morning. We pray that every cold heart may be kindled with fire, may
       this lack-a-dazz'icle Laodicean spirit be cursed, may its power be broken. And may each one of
       us be set on fire by the promises of God for this hour. Help us Lord to move away from all the
       coldness of this last day, that has crept into the churches. Set us on fire Lord! Oh, Lord God it’s
       so terrible out here now and we cannot imagine what it will be like when the holy spirit leaves
       the earth. Man will seek death and not be able to find it. Man will run into caves to hide from the
       wrath of the Lamb. Oh, Father what will it be when you look upon this earth and you don’t see
       your blood anymore. Oh, Father please help us Lord, please help us to have fear and reverence.
       God Help us to fear you with all of our heart. Now Lord bless us this morning as we ty to stand
       our post of duty in our feeble little ways. We pray God that you would help us Lord and forgive
       us of all of our sins. Put all of our sins under thy blood. Look down this morning upon this
       congregation and see the blood of the precious Lord Jesus, Father. And Lord we look to thy
       blood for forgiveness of sin this morning. In Jesus name, amen.
        You may be seated. I hope you’re not to cold. We thank God for this nice carpet on the floor.
       It would be a lot colder in here this morning if we didn’t have that. So, we’re thankful to God for
       that. We got three vehicles home this morning and I still had to have somebody to come after me
       to bring me to church. I’m thankful that the devil never burnt the house down and I was able to
       get the fire out. Course, those things don’t stir me none. Well, if it would of burnt down, well we
       got just one less room. All is gonna burn in a little bit anyway.
        Mostly what I’m concerned about is the promise of God. Cause I certainly don’t want to be
       left here on this earth the way that it is now. I can’t imagine, but I see the word of God but still
       I’m a human being like we are and we can’t imagine how bad it’ll be when the Holy Spirit takes
       us flight from the earth.

       63-0317E - The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals
       William Marrion Branham
       266 The Seals was broke (why?) in the last church age, to reveal these Truths. Why? The
       Lamb broke the Seals and revealed them to His Church, in order to collect His subjects for
       His Kingdom. His Bride, see! Oh, my! He wants to bring His subjects to Him now. 267 What is
       it? Out of the dust of the earth, out of the bottom of the sea, out of the pits, out of everywhere and
       Believing In Christ
       
       2
       every place, out of—out of the regions of the dark, out of paradise, wherever they may be. He’ll
       call, and they’ll answer. Amen! Amen! [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] He’ll call, and
       they’ll answer. 268 He come to get His subjects. He revealed His secrets, and they saw It. “And
       time is no more,” at that time. “Time has run out.” It’s finished. All right. 269 He leaves the
       Throne, to be an Intercessor, as a slain Lamb; to be a Lion, King; to bring the world to
       Judgment, who has rejected His Message. He’s not a Mediator. 270 Remember the Old
       Testament teaching now, as we hurry. When the blood went off the mercy seat, what was it?
       Judgment seat. 271 And when the Lamb, slain, walked forward from Eternity, out of the
       Father’s Throne, and took His rights, it was a Judgment Seat. Then He become, not a Lamb,
       but a Lion, King, and He calls for His Queen to come stand by His side. 272 “Know ye not the
       saints shall judge the earth?” Daniel said, “The Judgment was set, and the books were opened;
       and ten thousands times ten thousands of thousand ministered to Him,” King and Queen. “And
       then another Book was opened, which was the Book of Life,” that’s for the church. And the
       Queen and the King stood there.
       
        I’m so thankful that the Lord Jesus, God is looking at us through his blood at his son this
       morning. I’m so glad that he cannot see me. Brother Branham said that, “He don’t see me, he
       only sees his blood. And I’m so thankful for that more every day and the more I learn about
       Christ the more I come to appreciate what he has done for me.

       55-0403 - Fellowship By Redemption
       William Marrion Branham
       184 Well, we, through wrong doings, are red. “Though your sins be like scarlet,” red. Through
       the shed Blood of the Lord Jesus, God looking through there, red through red looks white.
       “They shall be white like snow.” See? Not through your something else; but through the
       Blood, the only place that He can fellowship. Outside of There, your own righteous, He’ll
       never see it. Your good works, He’ll never know it, until you come beneath the Blood, then He
       sees you as His Own beloved son or His daughter. Red through red looks white. 185 No matter
       what you’ve done, sinner friend. When God looks, sees you’re confess your sins as being
       wrong, and God looks through the Blood of the Lord Jesus, He sees you snow-white. No
       matter what you’ve done, He is looking through you, through Christ’s Blood. You’re
       redeemed; precious thing. God will never condemn you no more. He can’t condemn you.

       56-0120 - Fellowship With God Through Reconciliation
       William Marrion Branham
       33 And let me give you a little bit of scientific something. You can take a red, purely, genuine,
       red glass, and look through it at a red object, and red through red looks white. Figure it out.
       God, looking through the Blood of Christ to a red sinner, is white as snow. “Though your sins
       be red like crimson, they shall be white like snow.” God knew what He was doing when He
       looked through the Blood of the innocent to the guilty that’s bloody red, and He sees him
       Believing In Christ
       
       3
       white. Not because he’s righteous, but because he’s accepted the righteousness of God
       through Christ, and become reconciled back to fellowship again with God. Not because
       something that you do, some good deeds… That’s all right. You do the good deeds because
       you are a believer, but that doesn’t do it by good deeds. Joining church is all right, but that isn’t
       what does it. It’s when you recognize that you’re a sinner, lost, and the only way that God can
       see you righteous is through the Blood of Jesus Christ. Then when He sees you through the
       Blood of Jesus, He sees you as innocent as His own Son, Christ Jesus was. That’s the Gospel
       story, friend. Believe that, accept that, and worship through that, you can have what you ask
       for. God said, so. Yes, sir. 34 “If ye abide in Me, and My Word in you, ask what you will, and
       it shall be given unto you.” There’s the secret of it. There’s the secret of that great life that’s
       hid away in God, that knows no fear, whether it’s stormy, whether the clouds are over, or
       whether the moon’s not shining, or the sun’s not shining, they’re still living in that Shekinah
       glory. Amen. There you are, the fellowship
       
        That without the shedding of blood there’s no other way to approach him, no other way to
       stand before him. And all your sin that comes short of the glory of God, come short of the glory
       of God. The glory of God is the Token, the power of God. We’ve all come short of the glory of
       God. And there’s only one way for him to get the glory of God to us and that is by the blood. The
       Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and the whole world has been covered by the blood.
        The seven church ages has been covered by the blood. But the plan to the Blood has been lost.
       The Blood hasn’t been lost but the plan to the blood has been lost. The world has been covered
       by the blood the churches has been covered by the blood. But the plan to appropriate the blood
       and apply the blood has been lost. So, therefore that’s why the great blessings of God has been
       lost.
        And we’re so blessed to be here this morning. To be living in an hour when God is restoring
       the plan to the blood. And this church age has rejected the plan to the blood. So, therefore they
       do not have no blood. They do not have no blood, other than God looking down upon the earth,
       when he looks down upon the earth he sees the blood. Now as long as he can see that blood, that
       holds back most of the earth quakes and the tornadoes, but a certain amount of that because of
       the sins are so great, God let’s that come by anyway for just a temporary judgement. But now
       children you think what it’s gonna be when he removes that blood and that holy wrathful
       Jehovah God looks down there and don’t see no blood no more and see’s all that sin and
       wickedness. He don’t see it now, he looks down there through the blood. He only looks through
       the blood, he only hears the voices of the people.
        But when that blood is removed from the people and the mercy seat. Sometime will get into
       that, the blood leaving the mercy seat, and try to bring that to you. I don’t know whether I’ve
       ever preached on that or not.
        But men going around saying, “The blood’s left the mercy seat.” God we’re in terrible shape
       if it is. If the blood left the mercy seat this world would go into convulsions. But it’s just a lack
       of understanding.
        So, we’re just thankful this morning for the blood. Are you thankful for the blood this
       morning? (Amen)
        Well, we had a wonderful prayer meeting last night. And I hope in the future to come, I think
       if you men are not in this prayer meeting, the devil hath deceived you and snared you! I want
       every man in this church, if you claim to be a Christian, you be in this prayer meeting. If not

       you’re a coward and you turned your back and running from your duties. How many say amen?
       (Amen) We have got to put our shoulders to the wheel as real soldiers. And it’s not far while
       others lay in a bed of ease while others are fighting to win the prize, while sailing through these
       stormy seas. Is, that right? (Amen) We’ve got to put our shoulders to the wheel. If we call
       ourselves Christians then we’re gonna have to rise up and draw our swords and fight the devil
       with everything that we got in us. And stand like real brave soldiers, knowing that the power of
       the enemy is great. And unless somebody stands to resist him with the word of God in prayer
       then it’s gonna be a terrible site. So, God is depending on you and I, to not shirk our duty and
       turn our backs like cowards, but draw our swords and fight the devil. The Bible says, “Resist the
       devil and he’ll flea from you.”
       James 4:7-Scripture quote:
       7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
        And what if this morning if we could yielded up to the holy spirit this morning? We’d be
       really in the midst of a service this morning. The congregation has got to learn how to yield
       themselves to the Holy Spirit.
        You heard him cry out there, that was the mind of the Lord see! That was just what I was
       going to speak on this morning. Something was wrong, the spirit was saying. When you hear a
       man that’s yielded to the Lord and hear that come gushing out of him, that’s the Lord. That’s the
       burden of the spirit. And if your spiritual catch the burden of the Lord and yield to it yourself
       pick that up and go on with it. Then you’re in the spirit. But if you draw back from the man
       that’s in the spirit, your sitting there in the flash and in the carnal. And if you are that’s resentful
       to you. You come in here sleepy headed, you don’t want to hear that. You just want to get the
       service over with and home to butter and beans. Oh, brother and sister if we could only learn
       yield to the Lord. If only we all could just get the mind of the Lord and get the burden of the
       spirit. That’s what everyone of us have got to have, a burden of the spirit. Move into the burden
       of the spirit and when we do we’re all in the spirit. How many say amen to that? (Amen) Think
       about it, we have chance and a opportunity and we can’t let it pass by.
        So, God has laid it upon our hearts, to increase our prayer meetings. And the brethren last
       night voiced their hearts desire that the women that can…Cause, we know that it’s hard. If you
       have children maybe, some that just have a small number of children maybe somebody could
       babysit or work it out some way. But with some of you women that have a desire to be in prayer
       meeting with the brothers then we’d like to welcome you to our…We kinda felt that it wasn’t
       right just having a men’s prayer meeting. I feel that…I don’t know why it worked around in this
       hour that just the men come and pray. But I’m afraid that some of the women put us to shame in
       praying. Most of the assemblies, it’s the women… If anything, that’s done for the Lord or any
       burden that’s carried it’s usually the women that carry it because they’re the ones that’s praying.
       But we’re thankful to God in this assembly that God has give us a super abundant amount of men
       that desire to pray. Now that would have to be God himself. Because across the country, I don’t
       know any assembly that’s got any men that desires to pray. Most of them do not have any prayer
       meetings at all. Most of them have two services a week, some have three but no seeking God, no
       prayer meetings. That’s really the life line of our assembly. No prayer…I don’t care how much
       revelation you got, it will not do the job because unless people are praying the revelation will go
       right on by and we can’t pick it up.

        You know you heard the tapes of Brother Branham you heard the hollered amen, amen, amen.
       I seen people on the front seat holler amen the loudest and brother Branham wasn’t in the grave
       three days till they we’re blaspheming the message and saying the tapes are old manna. All kinds
       of things so it’s a lack of being able to be spiritual to hear what the spirits saying. In order to be
       spiritual, we must learn to give ourselves…
        As brother Branham taught us, as a young virgin has her sacred virtues and she must keep her
       body pure for a holy matrimony to being forth life. So, there forth she must guard her body
       against all evil. And then that’s just like the Bride of Christ, she must guard herself with the word
       of God in Prayer. Those are two virtues that she absolutely positively must keep and that is the
       word of God and prayer. And you just can’t give yourself to the word of God and let down on
       the other virtue. You must keep both of them they go together. Their husband and wife and they
       got to go together, and that’s the word of God and prayer. Just giving yourself to your Bible, to
       the tapes is not enough. You must balance that out. And I find that out even so in my own life. A
       little bit by little bit you get away from the soul travailing prayer. And that’s what I’m concerned
       about and spoke about to the brethren last night. It was just a marvelous blessing to see one
       hundred percent of the men move right in with that burden and desire. And they even want to
       pray in the mornings, to come here and pray every morning this week.
        And I was thinking if it was possible, if it would be possible to make that a 9 o'clock prayer?
       I think it would be easier for some of the others to meet at 9 o'clock. And if we even come and
       prayed an hour, it would be a glorious thing. If we could come and pray one hour would be
       tremdous victory, God will bless that tremdous. And what we want to do, is let the Lord lead us
       and had as much prayer as we can pray.
        Now remember, all your prayers is going up into a censor before the Lord. If you don’t pray,
       there’s not any going to be any up there. All your voices and crying to God…Let me tell you
       something right out there ringing through eternity and they’re right up there in a vessel before the
       Lord, he’s hearing those prayers. And when God sees in your heart that we got to have revival or
       just die of a broken heart he’s going to give it to us. You will never get it with just a lack-adazi'cal attitude. Yawning and saying yes, I’m hungry for the Lord. See, it’s just got to be!
        It’s just like a boy getting married, and this is what I believe. If you can live without that girl,
       you better live without her. If you can get by without marrying her, and you an’t gonna die well
       then you ought to live without her. But if it’s gonna kill yea for somebody else to marry her, and
       you can’t sleep at night and you can’t eat and its worrying you to death, well you may as well
       not waste any time, go ahead and get married. But if you’ve not got a love like that, then you’ll
       never really find real happiness in marriage.
        And until we love the Lord so much, and it’s just our hearts is just aching down inside and it’s
       killing us, and when you get a chance to pray you just run and drop on your knees and just gush
       out your prayer to the Lord and make love to him now. Now I’m telling you, that’s getting on
       fire for God. But if we come to the place when we get down and we’re half sleepy and we’re
       yawning and praying to the Lord, you see and you pray five minutes. Oh See, that’s Laodicean
       that’s spiritual laziness, that cowardness that’s not facing our responsibility in the word and
       prayer. And we got to wake up to that fact, pinch our conscience and wake up.

       157 And now may these people who has the Token, that they’ve passed from death unto Life,
       they’ve changed from the old worldly life to a new one. They have. The Blood has been applied;
       and, God, give them a Token sign. May they take that Token in their hands, them that’s sick, say,
       “I am a purchased product of God. I am in Christ, and in Him is no sickness. I am in Christ, and
       in Him is no sin. I am in Christ, and in Him is no unbelief. I renounce everything that the devil
       has told me. I take my Token that my… ‘He was wounded for my transgressions; He was bruised
       for my iniquity; the chastisement of my peace was upon Him; and with His stripes I was healed.’
       And I now hold the Token, that God has recognized me, that purpose, Person, purchased by the
       Blood of the Lord Jesus. And I hold the Token of His death in my hands, because He has raised
       again, and I am His and He is mine. I go with determined faith, that from this night on, I believe
       God, and I’ll be healed when I get there and meet the requirements.”

       When you pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the Token, don’t say, “Well, now I’ll go up
       and try. Lord, I, I’m a little tired.” Oh, mercy, stay in your seat! Don’t even—don’t even make an
       attempt. If you come, say, “I’ll pass through the prayer line; put the oil on my head, I’ll see if it
       does me any good,” might as well set where you’re at. Until you get to that place, until the
       Believing In Christ
       
       7
       whole church gets to a place, that it’s between death and life, you’ve got to have It now or
       perish, then God will move on the scene. It takes desperation to bring God on the scene.
        And that’s what we’ve got to do right now, I believe that this is the hour, this is the time to
       strike at it and apply ourselves to it. It’s now or never, because the tribulation is ready to set in.
       So, God help us brother and sister.
        As a little brother from Trinidad said, “Brother Bob I done gone through much tribulation and
       I can’t go through the great one” He said, “I’ve got to go in the rapture with what tribulation I’ve
       gone through” And I feel like that myself, we’ve gone through enough tribulation. Listen its hell
       enough to live here, without going through the tribulation. How many say amen to that? (Amen)
       And you can imagine people as mean as they are now, how is it gonna be when the holy spirit
       takes its flight.
        Remember, not no Holy Spirit on the earth! Hunted and persecuted and hunted down like
       dogs. They’ll hunt you down like dogs, torment you with scientific ways to torment you, to keep
       you alive just to torment you. And you got no spirit of God to help you at all. Plus, you got all
       that depressing oppressing spirit of the devil just on you twenty-four hours a day. And then on
       top of that you know you done missed the rapture. That’s enough to drive you out of your mind
       right there, knowing that you missed the rapture. And then on top of that, you know that if you
       bow down to that Mark of the Beast to get some bread… If you bow down to that Mark of the
       Beast to get bread and housing and the necessities of life…you know if you bow down to that
       and go down and get in line for your food, then you know right then that you have excepted the
       Mark of The Beast and then you’re gonna be cast in the lake of fire. So, there’s only one thing
       that you can do, one promise that you can stand on and that is die, die, die no matter how much
       they torment you, you do not deny the faith. Oh friend!
        If we could only realize that’s ready to set in, see. And we have got to above all things wake
       up and get desperate and press on. One day it’ll come upon you as a thief in the night, see. Days
       are just clicking by, years are clicking by, almost going on six years that the prophets been gone,
       who would of known, we’d be here this long. Now, we know it can’t go on any longer. There’s
       only one thing that is holding Jesus Christ up and that is the Bride must make herself ready.
       You’ve got something to do, I’ve got something to do, and that is you and I, if we’re gonna make
       it then let’s prove it to the Lord and make our self-ready. You say you can’t! Yes, you can, the
       way that you cut your tree, that’s the way it’s gonna fall.
        Now Gods gonna have court on day, he’s gonna have court one day and it’s right there. You
       can go in the rapture if you want to. You say predestination, well see predestination the Lord
       knows who wants to, see. He’s not willing that any should parish but he knows who’s gonna
       parish. He knows who’s gonna love him. He knows who wants to go in the rapture. So, if you’ll
       watch the way that your cutting your tree, then that’s the way it’s gonna fall. If we keep putting
       off till tomorrow what we ought to do today, then that’s where we’re gonna be in the tribulation.
       But if we wake up and come alert and begin to press in. And begin to take the word of God in
       our heart, begin to separate ourselves from all unbelief. And begin to take God at his word and
       cling to that word no matter what the cost is, then we’ll be all right. So, that’s a blessed hope that
       we have, for our family and for one another.
        So, we’d like to announce, that if any of you ladies would like to join us in prayer any time
       you will certainly be welcome and we’ll appreciate you. And we certainly know that your
       Believing In Christ

       praying at home, but I know how it is praying at home to. Usually at home, there’s lots of little
       things that you can do, besides praying, and it’s very easy for the enemy to snare you.
        And even in the early days of the early church… That why I put in that prayer chain one time
       because I thought it would be very good. We, prayed at nine o'clock, twelve o'clock, three
       o'clock and around the clock. People set their clocks, and even some of the little children set
       their clocks at three o'clock and got up out of bed and prayed. And God blessed that wonderfully
       and the mighty presence of God moved into our assembly. How may remember those days?
       (Amen) He’d just sweep down in waves of glory and passed right over our assembly.
        And so now, I feel that we have come together and prayed here, like Peter and John they went
       down to the night hour of prayer. They had different hours of prayer. They went down to the
       temple of God and prayed, and so that’s what we’ve got to do. And if you want to pray with us,
       the women foke, then you will certainly be welcome. I think we’re gonna pray, Monday
       morning, Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning and all through the week. Maybe I guess, they
       will maybe pray Saturday morning, I don’t know. But anyway, we’ll start off Monday morning
       and different ones that can come. If you work an afternoon shift and you can and stop by and
       pray. Maybe we pray an hour or hour and a half, whatever the spirit blesses us and leads us to
       pray. And I think that is showing to God that we mean business. When he sees, us coming here
       and that’s a sacrifice to do that, and we’re making a sacrifice that we mean business with God.
       We’re praying and crying for him to do it. He’s promised it, but we’re confessing that he
       promised it and we’re believing it by putting actions to it. Then I believe that we’re in…That will
       be a sign that you’re gonna do it.
        I was reading the history of Azusa Street and they prayed one year, one year they prayed.
       Now I believe God is gonna do a short work. And it Maybe God is waiting for us to make up our
       mind that we’re gonna pray three years. That we’re gonna keep this up if it’s three years, if it’s
       four years. Because we an’t got nowhere else to go. It’s go this way or go through the tribulation.
        But it would be like Brother Branham told his wife, “There’s a little money in the jar and I
       may not be back. But I said, I can’t go on any longer. And I’m gonna find out what this great
       presence is around me. And he said, “I may not be back.” But I’ll hear from God or he’ll either
       find a bag of bones.

       He got down in the cornfield, and he said, “Lord, if You don’t give me the baptism of the Holy
       Ghost, when You come back to earth, You’re going to find a pile of bones laying right here.”
       God give him the Holy Ghost. You got to get determined. That’s right. Get ready. Take over.
       God said so. Let’s go take over. That’s what God wanted us to do. That’s what God wants us to
       do tonight. God’s always willing to give us, if we’re ready to receive it. That’s right. God’s
       made the promise, so it’s ours. The promise is unto you, and to your children, to them that’s far
       off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. So, the promise is here.
       
       Well, with that determination in his heart he wasn’t up there two or three hours till the angel of
       the Lord come to him.

        What’s the use for the Lord to tarry any longer when he sees it in your heart and your gonna
       stay there anyway. But if you get down and bluff it, when the congregation is just bluffing and
       says, “Oh Lord we’re hungry for revival, Lord we really want it” But down in your heart you
       really don’t want it, because you’re not willing to pay the price see. See, your mouth can say,
       “I’m hungry for God” But you know right down there, you’re not yielded to the Lord. Your mind
       may say it, but your heart will say something else. Now, that’s hypocrisy! If our mouth says
       something and our heart condemns it, then what is that? That’s hypocrisy. But we must from the
       heart, from the heart, when we make up our mind from the heart that we want the Lord Jesus
       Christ more than anything else in this world. And we’re willing to pay the price and the price
       tag…As we said last night is death. Put your name on it death, that’s the price.
        I like the words of Jesus Christ, except a grain of wheat… And if we’re wheat, how many
       believe your wheat? (Amen) He said, “Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die it
       abideth alone, but if it die, it will bring forth much fruit.”
       John 12:24-Scripture quote:
       24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
       alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
       And Jesus said, “Some brought forth thirtyfold, some brought forth sixtyfold and a
       hundredfold.”
       Matthew 13:8-Scripture quote:
       8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold,
       some thirtyfold
       .
       How may like to bring forth a hundredfold? (Amen)
        Now let’s look in our Bibles this morning. I cherish to the day, that I won’t have to preach
       any more. You’ll be in the ministry then, and I’ll have the blessed wonderful experience, of
       watching the Holy Ghost use you. That’s my desire! How many want to see my desire fulfilled?
       (Amen) I want to see you used of the Lord, that’s my desire.
        Brother Branham said, “One day the Bible will be closed and won’t be opened anymore and
       the word will be made flesh!” When is it made flesh? When the word becomes reality. And then
       it goes into action then.

       56 Someday the trumpet will sound for it’s last time. The Bible will lay closed on the pulpit.
       The mimic will make his last act. The sun will be setting in the west, and the arms will be stacked
       for the last time, and then we will be asked to give a reason for what we have done with these
       treasures that’s been sent to us. It’s a Book of treasures. Let us bow our heads, while we think
       of it. 57 Our heavenly Father, the ri—riches of God is sent to us by a letter, a message of the
       Bible, that the Holy Spirit was ordained of God, our Father, through the Blood of His Son, Jesus,
       to bring us this message. He is a true witness of Christ, for it is written, “When He, the Holy
       Ghost, is come, He will bring these things to your remembrance, that in here, remind you, that
       Believing In Christ
       
       10
       you’ve got treasures and riches untold in the pages of this Book.” Not only that, but He will
       show you things to come. And the works that Christ did, He said the Holy Spirit would do it in
       us. We’re so happy to know these things are true. Now, You said, and it’s been written in the
       Bible, “As many as believed on Him, to them, gave He the power to become sons and
       daughters of God.
        Matthew 13:36 Now, I didn’t have much time to look at this message, but I had a note here
       that came to me a few days ago so, I thought I’d preach on this one word here. I want you to get
       this in your heart, this one word and know what it is.
       Matthew 13:36-43 Scripture Reading:
       36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him,
       saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
       37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
       38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the
       children of the wicked one;
       39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers
       are the angels.
       40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this
       world.
       41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things
       that offend, and them which do iniquity;
       42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
       43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears
       to hear, let him hear.
        Let’s bow our heads, Lord bless this beautiful text of scripture Lord. And give thy children
       thy seed of the kingdom Lord. The children of the kingdom give them understanding to this
       scripture. In Jesus name, amen.
        Now, this is another parable of the kingdom of heaven. And I’m sure that each one of you by
       now know what the kingdom of heaven it? Let’s see your hands you know what the kingdom of
       heaven is? That is one of the keys of understanding, the whole truth of Christ is the parables of
       the Kingdom. As we said, the kingdom of heaven is none other than the true Baptism of the holy
       spirit, which make up and places the individuals into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
        Now all denominations not all of them, but the ones that really emphasize the body of Christ
       is the Pentecostal movement of this last day. Most of those latter rain brethren and deliverance
       ministries, built their ministries around the body ministry. Because anybody that’s studious in the
       word of God can see that there is one body, only one church. There’s not a whole bunch secs of
       sectarian groups. There’s only one body! And there’s only one church! And in that one body and
       in that one church they have one head which is Christ. And one mind, so therefore they’re all of
       that one mind. There’s no bunch of different schisms and isams and different interpretations and
       everything in that body and in that church. They all speak the same thing, and they everyone
       have the same revelation because they got the same mind the same head. And the head is Christ!
       And the body is the believers. And the body is the same thing as the head is, which is the word.
       It’s a word born body with the head Jesus Christ being the head of all the whole body.

       62-0318 - The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed
       William Marrion Branham
       326 God is taking the Elect out of that Pentecostal church, that hybrid, pulling It out, and
       finishing up the Word. And it’s got to be so close until the Word Itself will blend with this
       Word. There comes the Headstone, crying, “Grace, grace, amazing grace.” The Headstone!
       327 Here you are, like this, see, on there. See how it way wide down here? And it keeps getting
       closer, closer, closer, the ministry. After while, here come…Here is Luther; justification,
       justified. Here come Wesley; sanctified bunch. Here come Pentecostal; restoration of the gifts.
       Now God is taking from there, honing out a bunch, to make a ministry just exactly like that
       Word there, because it’s got to fit with the Word. There’s the Bride; take Her up. 328 Now,
       Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil. You believe that? Now, I can’t explain
       all this. I’m just going to go through it, just quickly now, hit the high place so you won’t stay too
       long. Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil. Is that right? [Congregation says,
       “Amen.”—Ed.] You all believe that. That’s why He…What was He? God’s Word, which
       destroys the works of the hybrid, the devil. Is that right? He was done, to do that. He was born
       to be that, to destroy the works of the devil. 329 Now, His Body is to do the same. Because, the
       Body is, head and body is together. That right? If Christ is the Head, was the Word, His Body
       has to be the same thing as His Head was. That right? A Church of the Word, born of the
       Word, virgin-born from the Word! Not denominational now; virgin-born from the Word! The
       way the Body operates is by the Head. That right? 330 My body can’t move until my head tells it
       to move. Well, what if my head is flesh and my body is concrete? Huh! Can’t move. Head can
       say, “Move, move, move, move, move,” but there’s nothing to send a message to. Is that right?
       [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] 331 Well, if my Head is Christ, and my body is a
       denomination, how is it going to work? How can purity and a whore work together? Uh-huh.

       William Marrion Branham
       515 “He is the first fruits of the resurrection.” Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—
       Ed.] Watch. Then, what is He? “He is the Head of the Body, which is His Church, Bride.” Uhhuh. 516 Then, the Bride-Body must follow the Head, for it is part of His resurrection and part
       of the mystery. It’s impossible for it not to go. Oh, my! It’s part of God’s mystery, how God
       revealed Himself here and raised It up by the Word, so He reveals the Church and raising It
       up by the same Word. It’s a part of His threefold mystery. 517 As the Head was took from the
       grave, so must the Body follow Him back to Eden. Where, the Head of the family, the Man,
       the Bridegroom; the Bride being the Body of the Bridegroom, must follow, the Bride, because
       that’s the Head. And the Head is revealed, and come back with Eternal Life; and the Body
       must follow that, because it is Husband and Wife again. Amen! And as long as you’re
       pregnated with the same Word, which is His Body; you’ve took His Body, become in Him,
       when you took the Word. Not the creed; the Word! Oh, my! 518 Wouldn’t that make a text for
       this afternoon, to go on? Huh? My, wouldn’t that be wonderful? See? Just think of it now, what it
       is. 519 Therefore, the Body cannot recognize…Don’t you fail this. The Body, therefore, cannot
       Believing In Christ
       
       12
       recognize any other headship but the Word. Cause, the—the Head is connected with the Body,
       and the Head is the Word, and it’s the same Word, one Headship! Therefore, denominations,
       and holy fathers, and everything else, is dead dung. There is one Headship, that’s Christ. The
       Body only recognizes one thing, the Word!
        So therefore, all these latter rain brethren and Pentecostal preachers have emphasized the one
       body the one church. Now there is only one way that there can be a body. And that is, there has
       to come forth the revealed word of God to make that body! Because he’s building a body! The
       body isn’t made out of different kinds… Three or four different kinds of flesh. It’s only made out
       of one element and that is the word of God. It is absolutely the word of God! So, how in the
       world could there be three or five, fifty or a hundred different interpretations of the body?
        Now remember the body is the full body word! The bride of this end-time is not that or that or
       that or that. It’s not just what Luther had or Wesley had or what Azusa street had but its every bit
       of that. It’s the full body revealed word of God. So, that is what is gonna make up the body in
       this end-time. The Bride is to be the full body word. So, if we’re gonna be the Bride we’ve got to
       become the word of God. Now we are in the process of becoming the word of God. That’s why
       he is gonna have, One Lord, One faith, One Baptism, One God, One people, One body and One
       spirit to drink from and One spirit to be baptized into that body with.
        Now, supposing we become the word. We are in the process of becoming the word. Then the
       next thing is for the spirit to Baptize us into Christ the head. Do you understand? That’s the only
       thing left. The Bible says, for by one spirit are we all Baptized into this one body.
       1Corinthians 12:12,13-Scripture quote:
       12For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being
       many, are one body: so also is Christ.
       13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
       we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
        Now when you find that one body, you’re not gonna find five or six different opinions or five
       or six different interpretations of the message. It’s one basic revelation, one revelation coming
       forth from one mind which is Christ, which is the headstone, which is the Token.
        That’s why we’re not sitting…You go down and see different ministers saying, “Oh praise the
       Lord, where two or three gathered together in my name and the Lords here this morning”. It’s
       one thing to say he’s here but it’s another thing for him to be there. We can say it, but it doesn’t
       make him there. Then they say, “We’re all gathered here this morning, sitting in heavenly places
       in Christ Jesus.” There’s not one group in the world today that is sitting in heavenly places in
       Christ Jesus! I defy that statement! I challenge that statement! And I want one man…I’ll repent
       that God ever called me and put a sign on my back and walk through every assembly and say I’m
       of the devil, a false prophet, if one man will rise and show me where there is anybody sitting in
       heavenly places in Christ Jesus! If you tell me that you’re sitting in heavenly places in Christ
       Jesus preacher and your congregation, and I come there I want to see the nine gifts of the holy
       ghost in operation. I want to see prophets, I want to see apostles, I want to see the love of God
       demonstrated. I want to see the nine fruits of the spirit. I want to see the sick delivered, I want to
       see the blind see and the lame walk and the dead raise and I want to see the secrets of the heart
       made manifested. And when I see that, I’ll say and I’ll bow down and say, “I have found the
       Believing In Christ
       
       13
       mountain of God, I have found Mt. Zion, I found the true church, I found the body of Jesus
       Christ, I found the Bride of Christ!” So, brother and sister till we see that, we haven’t found the
       body. And you haven’t found it yet! Amen!
        But one day there is gonna come forth a body. Where you find that body you are gonna find
       the kingdom of heaven. And when you find the kingdom of heaven you’ll find the power of
       Christ. You’ll find the blind see and the lame walk and the dead being raised. And the GOSPEL
       PREACHED IN THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST!
        The reason why you can’t find it today, is because the body is not in operation today. The
       body is here on earth, but the body is not put together. It’s not placed in Christ yet. It’s believing
       on Christ, but it’s IN Christ. You know it’s one thing to believe on Christ but it’s another thing to
       believe IN Christ!
        You know before Pentecost; all the apostles went out and did wonderful miracles and things
       by believing on Christ Jesus. They believed on Christ Jesus and they cast out devils and healed
       the sick and was able to do some wonderful things. But you know they still had a lot of unbelief
       in them.
        Peter saw Jesus come walking on the water when he was in the boat…
       Now I’m getting to running a rabbit here, but I’ll just go on anyway it’s feeling good! How many
       don’t mind me running the rabbit? (Amen)
       Peter was in the boat one night, and the boat looked like it was gonna sink. And here they seen
       something walking on the water. And they looked and they thought it was a spirit, but they
       looked a little closer and it looked like it was the Lord Jesus. But they couldn’t understand how it
       could be the Lord Jesus their friend walking on the water. Seeing that there was no peers of
       concrete or any planks to walk on. He was walking literally on the water and the water was deep
       and the water was wet and the water was boisterous and they thought it was gonna sink the ship.
       And they thought maybe it was a spirit. But the Lord said, “Fear not it is I!” It’s the I Am
       hallelujah! It’s the I Am that made the water! And I’m out here walking on the water to show
       you that if I walked on the water that you’d ought to be able to walk on it to! I’m coming to show
       you that I’m taking back everything that Adam undone and everything that Adam lost! I’m
       coming to show that and that’s why I sent you out before me here in the boat, so the storm could
       come up so I could come walking on the water. And he said, the works that I do, like walking on
       the water shall ye do also! Why, BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON OF GOD! YOU’RE A
       CREATOR, WE HAVE POWER OVER the elements of the water! I come walking on the
       water, and the water was wet and the water was deep. And they thought it was a spirit. And Peter
       cried out and said, Lord if it’s thee? He doubted it! He said, Lord if it’s thee? That’s unbelief!
       How could a man be walking on the water? Never has it ever been heard of in the sea of Galilee
       as long as I’ve fished here, never has there ever been a fisherman that could walk on the water.
       But never-the-less, here was a man, a real man that was born of a woman walking on the water
       and his name was the Lord Jesus Christ from Nazareth. And he was literally walking on the
       water. They was in a boat, brother he was in better shape, than they was!
       Peter was in a man-made boat and it was SINKING, HALLELUJAH! I’D RATHER BE A
       SAINT OF GOD BROTHER AND BE WALKING IN A SUPERNATURAL MIRACLE THEN
       BE IN A MAN-MADE INTERPRETATION IN A BOAT THAT WAS SINKING! Jesus was in
       better shape than they was. Here they had a man-made safe boat to get on the other side, and the
       devil sunk it. Brother it’s a lot safer to walk in the power of God on the water than in a boat.
        You know one time they built a great ship here in a America, and the ship was said it was a
       total impossibility to sink it. And oh, how they blowed their head up and bragged and was full of
       Believing In Christ
       
       14
       pride over this great ship called the Titanic. Now it’s used as a by-word said if a boat is ready to
       go down it’s said, “It sunk like the titanic.” And that boat sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
        But oh my, here was a man that made the water. Peter was saying, “Lord, if it is you? Bid me
       to come walking on the water” Peter was believing on Jesus Christ but he wasn’t believing IN
       him. If he’d be believing IN him, he would of fared a lot better than he did. Peter said, “Well if it
       is you Lord Jesus, bid me to come walk on the water.” Jesus said, “Come!”
       Don’t you know that built pressure up in the boat? Peter stepped out over the boat maybe and
       them saying, Peter are you sure! … And they said to Peter, we dropped a rock down there with a
       string on it one day and we couldn’t find no bottom. Then Peter stepped out there, and boy those
       big waves was coming over and he looked, at the Lord. Well, he that much faith anyway that if
       something go wrong he’d have somebody to help him out. Peter stepped over and when his foot
       hit the water it was just as solid as can be. Did you ever step out on something and it looked a
       little spooky Brother Graybill? That you just kinda test it out a little bit you know, it see if it’s
       gonna break. And Peter stepped out and put his foot on it and it was just as solid as can be. My,
       he let out a, “Praise the Lord!” He stepped out there and put the other foot out there and all the
       brothers in the boat I guess said, “Praise the Lord look at that! Peter is walking on the water!”
       Then all at once, another big wave come through the air like that you know. And boy, he got his
       eyes off the Lord Jesus and seen that big wave and fear gripped a hold of him and he started
       under. Then Peter said, “Lord help me, I’m drowning help me!” Jesus was just standing there
       solid as can be and reached down and got him by the hand and said, “Oh Peter, oh ye of little
       faith, wherefore didst thou doubt, you were doing so good?”
        What was the matter? What was the matter? The trouble with Peter was, he was believing on
       the Lord Jesus Christ but he wasn’t believing IN Christ.
        But oh, blessed be the name of the Lord, when Jesus Christ told them to go down into
       Jerusalem and tarry there until they be endued with power from on high.
       Luke 24:49-Scripture quote:
       49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,
       until ye be endued with power from on high.
        He said, “In that day you will know that I’m in the father and the father in me and I in you
       and you and me and the works that I did, like walking on the water shall ye do also and greater
       works than these shall ye do because I’ll be in you even unto the consummation.
       John 14:20-Scripture quote:
       20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
       John 14:12-Scripture quote:
       12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and
       greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
        Brother on the day of Pentecost when he come down out of heaven, he come upon those
       people an burnt out every bit of unbelief. They had faith for the promise of the hour, they had
       faith on Christ but they couldn’t believe IN Christ because they wasn’t IN Christ at that time.
       They was on the outside of Christ. If Peter had been INSIDE CHRIST, HE COULD OF
       WALKED ON THE WATER, Hallelujah! WHY? BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
       Believing In Christ
       
       15
       PETER WALKING ON THE WATER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JESUS CHRIST WALKING
       ON THE WATER. Hallelujah!
        When the fullness of the Godhead bodily came down IN a hundred and twenty on the day of
       Pentecost, they was no more believing on Christ. But by believing on Christ brought them to a
       place where Christ came down on the inside! Hallelujah! Jesus Christ came down and
       tabernacled himself in a hundred and twenty, it was no more them but the Lord Jesus Christ
       himself living out his life in them. They didn’t come out of the upper room believing on Christ,
       they come down out of the upper room Believing IN Christ! They went past the gate
       beautiful…Peter and John had past the gate beautiful for many years for many of days and many
       of months. They had past by there with the ministry that Jesus Christ had givin them before. He
       had commanded them to go into all the cities and heal the sick and cleanse the lepers and raise
       the dead and do all them wonderful miracles.
        They had past by that ole beggar many of times with the other ministry that they had
       believing on Christ. But many times, they had been defeated in their ministry that they had.
        And that’s the trouble with us this morning. That’s why we stand defeated this morning, not
       being able to do the things that we ought to do.
        Jesus Christ said, “The works that I do ye shall do also” if Jesus Christ walked on the water
       then we should be able to walk on the water. If Jesus Christ broke the bread and fed the
       multitudes, we ought to break bread and feed multitudes. Come on, it’s either the word of God or
       it’s a lie. Heavens and earth shall pass away but the word of God shall never pass away.
        If Jesus Christ walked on the water…He said, if I walked on the water, you can walk on the
       water. He said, if I broke the bread and fed the hungry and when the depression sets in, you
       ought to be able take a loaf of bread and break it and feed the people. And if you can’t do it, then
       you’re not believing like you ought to believing.
        But I’m persuaded that the end-time Bride will be raptured without any unbelief. Amen! I’m
       fanatical enough to believe it. I believe it with all my heart. Yes sir!
        He said the works that I do, shall ye do also. Was that a work? Sure, it was! When he broke
       the bread, and fed the multitudes, he stumbled the people and they couldn’t figure it out. They
       said, such a mighty prophet has risen out of Galilee, he fed over five thousand men not counting
       the women and the children. There must have been twenty to twenty-five thousand people he fed
       with three fishes and five loaves of bread or whatever it was. Think about it! Fed twenty-five
       thousand maybe.
        But first he told the disciples to feed them. They said, “Lord bid these people to go away so
       they can purchase bread. For they have been following you for three days now and their weak
       and their hungry and their fainting and there’s no little store around here, that they can buy
       bread. He said, “Well, don’t worry about it, you just feed them” They was worried to death! The
       babies was crying, people was getting headaches and getting sick to their stomach as they had
       nothing to eat. And they we’re coming to the disciples saying, haven’t you got a bread line, ain’t
       you got a soup line, have you got a kitchen out here to feed us with. They we’re putting pressure
       on them. They said, Lord we’re getting in trouble out here, there’s a pressure building up in the
       crowd there ain’t no food. He wasn’t worried about it. He said, “Well you give them to eat” They
       said, “What, give them to eat? Lord, where could you get enough bread here in the wilderness to
       feed such a multitude, where could you get enough bread?” He said, “You just give them to eat!”
       Now what did he do? He did that to test them. See, what! They we’re believing on Christ, but
       they wasn’t believing IN Christ.
       Believing In Christ
       
       16
        Jesus said Oh, perverse wicked generation, how long will I suffer with you! Bring me the
       loaves of bread and the two fishes here. They brought the food to him and he blessed it brother,
       Jesus Christ looked in the word of God and seen who he was. He seen what Adam lost, he seen
       what Adam had and he come to undo what Adam done. He said, give me the bread and give me
       the fishes and he blessed it and said, “Now feed them” And every time as I said before, each time
       the little parsons reached down and grabbed a loaf of bread and broke a piece off, it grow'animationendd right
       back out again. Every time they broke…They called it Peters fish there out of Galilee. He broke
       a piece of that fish off, it grow'd right back out. And when they got through feeding them they
       had twelve baskets of bread and fish left over.
        But never-the-less the point that I want to make, that they we’re believing on Christ. They
       we’re believing on Christ instead of IN Christ.
        But when that glorious baptism of the holy ghost came down upon a hundred and twenty,
       Jesus Christ himself come down on the inside of their soul and set up headquarters. He’s gonna
       carry his ministry out from now, from down on the inside of the hundred and twenty.
        Two of those hundred and twenty went by the gate beautiful, they we’re no more believing on
       Christ. But they had Christ Jesus inside them. So, they had a supernatural God, a supernatural
       faith, a supernatural Christ down on the inside of them. Jesus Christ came down on the inside of
       them so therefore they had the mind of Christ. It was no more of them doing the work but it was
       him in them, doing the work.
        Then it became a reality, when Peter and John passed by there…
       They hadn’t experienced to many things yet to what had happened on the day of Pentecost. But
       they knowed enough to know that the experience that they received on the day of Pentecost was
       God himself coming down and tabernacle himself in their body. Now everyone of the hundred
       and twenty new that was the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost is.
        Literally the person of Jesus Christ comes down inside your person. Now when that happens,
       there won’t be no doubt about it. Because you hear and know by experience of that supernatural
       person down inside of your person. It’s like you take a little miniature Lord Jesus and say you
       swallowed him and he went down on the inside. You know he’s down there and you can feel him
       down there and he talks out doing all these supernatural wonderful things. That’s what the
       baptism of the holy ghost… that’s kinda explaining in baby form, but that’s really what it is. It’s
       the life of another person in your person. It’s the Lord Jesus down inside you. Now you know
       you got him down in there, because you’ve heard him speak out and talk to you. You heard him
       take your vocal cords and speak out and talk, reveal the secrets of the heart, tell you supernatural
       things, talk to you, call your name. When he’s down in there, he can use your vocal cords and
       call your name and talk to you in a conversation.
        What do you think happen when the Bible said, “The word of the Lord Came to Jeremiah?”
       What do you think he heard? Do you think he heard an audible voice speak out there speaking to
       Jeremiah? No sir!
        You take it from me! Do you believe it? This is what happens, that supernatural anointing
       Christ is right on the inside of you he anoints your body, he anoints your tabernacle and you just
       yield yourself to him and then all at once he’ll take your vocal cords and start taking and say,
       “Bob Lambert, what are you doing sitting here, rise up from here and go down the street there, I
       have one of my children sitting down there.” And my ear is hearing that see. I know it’s the
       power of God I feel the anointing of the holy ghost and I hear my voice a talking but it an’t me,
       but I’m listening to it. My mind ain’t working, my mind is unfruitful to what I’m saying. I don’t
       know the thinking of this voice talking here, I don’t know the thinking of it.

        Why do you think that Peter said, “Did you sell the land for much? The men at the door is
       gonna pack you at dead.” That wasn’t him, Peter wouldn’t of struck that man dead. But what was
       it, that was God on the inside of Peter and looking right out of Peter’s eyes. He looked right out
       there and looked right at him and said, “You haven’t lied to Peter, this is not Peter that your lying
       to, this is me you’re lying to. This is the Lord Jesus Christ! This is the holy ghost that you’re
       lying to. Now there gonna pack you out and bury you.” And down he went, dropped dead. I
       guess Peter probably started crying, “Oh Lord! Have mercy!” To late! He’s done gone, it wasn’t
       Peter. Do you see what I mean? (Amen)
        Oh, how wonderful it is, the word of the Lord came to Jerimiah. The word of the Lord come
       to Isiah. What was it? God tabernacling himself down in human flesh, inside of a human vail.
       The person of Christ, no wonder the Bible said, “Ye have the mind of Christ.”
       1 Corinthians 2:16-Scripture quote:
       16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of
       Christ.
       No wonder the Bible said, “The word of God is the discerner of the secrets of the heart.” Who is
       the word of God? He’s the Lord Jesus Christ, the word of God.
       Hebrews 4:12-Scripture quote:
       12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing
       even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner
       of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
        That’s why people stumble at Brother Branham. When he come up there and yielded himself
       to the Holy Spirit, he just got himself out of the way. Brother Branham knew that the Lord Jesus
       Christ was down inside of him. He knew he couldn’t do nothing he was helpless unless that
       person down in there did something, so he just stood there and waited. And when the anointing
       of the holy spirit come upon him he just yielded himself and relaxed and the Lord Jesus Christ
       struck his vocal cords and said, “I see that your name is Mary Brown” Now Brother Branham
       don’t know Mary Brown, he never seen Mary Brown, but the man that was down on the inside of
       him KNEW WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH MARY BROWN, and he KNEW WHAT
       WAS THE MATTER WITH Mary Brown. And he told Mary Brown, “Thus saith the Lord your
       healed.” That’s why it was always perfect, because it was the Lord himself.
        Oh, my brother, the bible says, IN THAT DAY YOU’LL KNOW THAT I’M IN THE
       FATHER AND THE FATHERS IN ME AND I IN YOU AND YOU IN ME AND THE
       WORKS THAT I did ye shall do also!
        What a shim-sham, what a shim-sham what a shame, what a terrible thing it is for men and
       women go around today and claim that they got the great baptism God himself, tabernacle in
       human flesh and you can’t never see any witness or any sign that he’s down on the inside. What
       is it, it’s a terrible thing.
        But when Peter and John had received God tabernacle in their human flesh, they we’re no
       more believing on Christ. But by believing on Christ, brought them to the true experience of the
       Baptism of the holy ghost. But they had never walked IN Christ they never believed IN Christ.
       But blessed be the name of the Lord, a change took place brother after and he came down on the
       inside of the hundred and twenty.
       Believing In Christ

        Peter and John went up to the Temple to pray about the ninth hour and as they went by…Oh
       God, what’s he wanting to do? HE WANTS TO FIND A TABERNACLE THAT HE CAN GET
       INSIDE OF! That’s always been the plan of God! Is to find a tabernacle that he can get into.
       THAT THEIR HANDS COULD BE HIS HANDS, THAT THEIR EYES COULD BE HIS
       EYES, THAT THEIR MOUTH COULD BE HIS MOUTH AND HER VOICE COULD BE HIS
       VOICE. What was it? They knew that Jesus Christ…They didn’t have to pray no more to the
       Lord way out in heaven somewhere, way out in space somewhere. But the Lord Jesus Christ, had
       come down on the inside of them and they we’re supping with him and he was supping with
       them, and they we’re having communion together, they was having fellowship together. Where
       Peter walked, Jesus walked with him.
        If Peter went into the boat and it was sinking it would have to sink Jesus. If the boat could
       sink Jesus then it could sink Peter. Amen! Why? They didn’t worry no more, they wasn’t afraid
       any more.
        Let me tell you something this morning! What fear could grab a hold of you when you know
       that you have the eternal God of Heaven and earth tabernacled down inside of you? Do you think
       it would scare you when they draw a sword and they say, “I’ll cut your head off?” The God that
       made man, that made the sword that made everything is down on the inside of you. That’s why
       perfect love casteth out all fear! You know that he loves you because he’s down on the inside!
       You know that he loves you, that he’ll never let nothing harm you!
       1 John 4:16-18-Scripture quote:
       16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that
       dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
       17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as
       he is, so are we in this world.
       18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that
       feareth is not made perfect in love.
        That’s why when they come to cut off ole Saint Martin’s head off, they said, “Are you St.
       Martin?” He said, “I’m he!” They said, “Well we’re gonna take you down to the emperor.” He
       said, “Will you give me one hour to pray?” They said, “Well go ahead and pray” And brother he
       got down and he prayed such conviction on them men, that they was scared to death of him!
       Think about it! And boy, when they come to the place where they we’re gonna cut his head off…
       They said, we got to cut your head off and martyr you because you won’t denounce this faith.
       And we’ll give you a chance to denounce this faith. Do you think he was scared? (No) He knew
       that he had the eternal God, the Lord Jesus Christ down on the inside. And they said, we want
       you to denounce this faith or will cut your head off. And he said, “Well you’ll have to cut it
       off!” And that ole boy reached down and pulled that sharp sword out and Martin threw his coat
       back and said, “Cut it off!” And he struck at his head and the power of God hit him and knocked
       him about fifteen feet. Oh, he didn’t care! They didn’t have no fear in those days, they had Christ
       down on the inside! They never had to worry what they was gonna say, all they had to do is just
       wait for him to speak. And brother when he spoke, everything had to be still!
        Oh, God! When I think of what they call the baptism of the holy ghost today, it’s repulsive to
       me and if it’s repulsive to me, it must be nauseating to God. We don’t need just tongues and
       interpretations and prophesy’s, BROTHER WE NEED GOD TABERNACLED IN OUR
       HUMAN BODIES! Hallelujah!

        And show this world what a Christian is. A Christian is the life of another person in my
       person. Living out the life of that person.
        Let me tell you something, the early apostles they never rested day or night till they got every
       member of their congregation to the place where God come down inside them. They never rested
       until they heard that God speak out of that man in a supernatural way.
        We’ve got to be identified with him! How can we be identified, unless he comes down and
       identifies himself in us?
        Let me tell you something, when you find a church where the word of God is discerning the
       secrets of the heart, where the gifts of the spirit are in operation. Where men and women are
       living holiness, where you find that love of God, where you find the power of God triumphing
       over every enemy, THERE YOU WILL FIND GOD, DIETY TABERNACLED IN HUMAN
       BEINGS AND THAT’S THE BRIDE, THAT’S THE CHURCH, THAT HE’S COMING
       AFTER. He’s not coming after nothing less than that children. OH GOD! HELP US TO YEARN
       AND COME OUT OF THIS unbelief! It’s not enough to believe on Christ, but we got to get into
       Christ, to do what he’s called us for.
        Peter and John passing by the gate beautiful, they knew they had received a supernatural
       Christ down on the inside of them a few days before. And when they walked by the gate
       beautiful, the ole beggar looked up and said…Held out his hand for a alm. Saying, “Alms’,
       alms’, alms,’ alms’! The same ole beggar they passed by many times. All at once something
       moved, something moved down on the inside. Not in his mind but down on the inside!
       Something welled up in Peter, compassion moved up out of him. Love and Grace took over! He
       had passed by the ole man many times. And all at once he stood still and waited on the Lord to
       speak. Then all at once the Lord spoke up out of Peter and said, “Silver and Gold have I none”
       Who was it Jesus Christ tabernacle in Peter. He said, “Silver and Gold have I none, but such as I
       have I give unto thee, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise up and walk!” And the ole boy
       jumped up and his ankles received strength and he went leaping and praising God through the
       temple.
        What was it? Peter was then, IN Christ! He was not on the outside of Christ, he was on the
       inside of Christ. And that’s why, that we can’t find the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ in HIS
       POWER AROUND THE COUNTRY today. IS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
       FOLLOWING THE PROPHET ARE STILL ON THE OUTSIDE OF CHRIST!! WE’LL
       NEVER DO THE WORKS OF CHRIST UNTIL we come INTO Christ! Think about it, here we
       are right up to the time for the rapture and men and women are STILL ON THE OUTSIDE OF
       Christ! Oh my, dearly beloved brothers and sisters this morning, if God could sink down in the
       heart THE NEED TO COME INTO Christ! There’s only one God provided WAY that we can
       come into Christ and believe in Christ and that’s by ONE HOLY GHOST Baptism are we all
       placed into the body of Christ!

       213 Oh, when it come time for the great wrath of God to fall, every…There come two ducks,
       male and female. Here come two geese, male and female; here come two horses, male and
       female; something another pulling them, the predestinated. The rest of them perished. Oh! The

       It was a token that there’s coming a rain. They knowed that there was coming a rain, no
       matter what the display was and what other people’s thought. They knowed. 214 There was
       something inside of them, said, “Get into there, right quick! Get into there, because that’s the
       only place that’s going to be safe.” Because, God prepared a prophet, He sent the ark as a
       sign, said, “Get in there,” and the rain was coming. And they went right in there, two by two.
       All the animals went in, two by two, into the ark, because they had got beneath it. No matter
       what the rest… 215 And all outside of that ark perished. All outside of the token, of the blood,
       perished, everyone. And everyone outside of the Token, of the Holy Ghost, will perish. 216 No
       matter how good, how much church members! There was a lot of them in the days of Noah.
       There was a lot of them in the days of Moses; but a man that failed to apply the blood, as the
       token, was, he perished. Those who failed to go in the ark, perished. Those who fail to come
       into Christ, for He is the Ark! 217 First Corinthians 12, said, “By one Spirit we are all
       baptized into one Body.” The mythical, not church; but the mythical, not the denominations; the
       mystical Body of Jesus Christ! “By one Spirit,” capital S-p-i-r-i-t, Spirit, “we are all immersed
       into this one Body.” Then the Token is on the door, for you are in Christ. And He was the
       One, your Sacrifice, Who stood the judgment. And when God looks upon that, He can’t do a
       thing. You’re just as safe as you can be, because God and Christ is the self-same Person, the
       Spirit been made flesh and dwelt among us. And there is God with His Ownself, and you, His
       Own children, into the Body. There you are, not a chemical, but the Spirit! “I will pass over
       you.”

       259 And then when he heard Pastor Moses speak, that day, he said, “But you’ve got to get
       beneath that blood, for God said, ‘The blood is a token.’ It’s a token! No matter how much you
       believed, how much you are circumcised; that’s a covenant God gave to Abraham, and so forth,
       that’s the covenant. But you’ve got to get beneath the blood, that’s a token, for He said, ‘When
       I see the blood, I’ll pass.’ Israelite, or any!” 260 That’s denomination or not denomination,
       either one, you must come beneath the Blood. Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal,
       undenomination, whatever you are, it’s for an individual. You’ve got to come beneath the
       Blood. Now just don’t talk about It; receive It! Hear me! Hear me! In the Name of the Lord,
       hear me! See? Got to come beneath the Blood! 261 He was not responsible for any persons
       from beneath the blood. God made it clear that all from under that blood would perish. 262
       May I use His Words? All outside of Christ will perish. How do you get in Christ? First
       Corinthians 12, “By one Spirit!” 263 Not, “by one handshake, by one membership, by one
       denomination.” That’s what they’re trying to make it. They may do that. 264 “But by one Spirit
       we are all baptized into one Body.” “If an angel from Heaven teaches anything else,” Paul
       said, “let him be cursed.” That’s the Message, come into Christ! 265 Look, any persons
       outside of the token, God was not responsible. And God is not responsible for any person, big
       or small, popular or unpopular, rich or poor, bond or free, male or female; He is not
       responsible for anybody that’s from under the Token covenant. He’s not responsible. 266 You
       say, “But, O Lord, I’ve did this. I cast out devils. Lord, I did this. I—I preached the Gospel.” 267
       “Depart from Me, you that work iniquity. I never even knew you.” He only recognizes the

       Token.
       
        Think about it! Believing on Christ is one thing, but believing IN Christ is another thing!
       We’re believing on Christ today by faith, but if we we’re believing IN Christ we would be sitting
       IN Christ IN Heavenly places IN Christ. It didn’t say, sitting in heavenly places believing on
       Christ Jesus. No! We are to be sitting IN heavenly places IN Christ Jesus is the way we should
       be living today. If we we’re believing IN Christ Jesus then we would see the works and the signs
       and the wonders that the early apostles had done. Oh, God! That’s’ Gods heart throb! THAT’S
       GOD’S HEART DESIRE TODAY IS TO SEE you come to that place where you can believe IN
       Christ. Absolutely!
        I don’t know how I ever got on that, but it’s true. How many want to believe in Christ?
       (Amen) It’s not enough to go on believing on Christ. We’ll stay dormant and dead like we are
       this morning.
        The best that we got is a little ole funny looking fellow up here and hollering and screaming
       and shouting! But Oh GOD! WE’RE LIVING FROM THE CRUMBS FROM THE MASTERS
       TABLE!! (Bro. Lambert weeps) WHEN I THINK ABOUT, WHAT GOD HAS PROMISED TO
       US IN THIS HOUR, GOD TABERNACLED IN HUMAN FLESH! “The works that I do ye
       shall do also and greater works then these shall ye do!” Why? Because I’m inside of you! Oh,
       God what a promise.
        When they deliver you up before the world council of Churches in the last day, don’t fear
       what your gonna say. There will be a word givin you in that hour, and it won’t be you speaking,
       but it will be the father.
        What a blessed assurance, what a positive to know that God has come down on your throne.
       And wherever you go Jesus Goes! Brother, if they put you in burning oil, like they did to ole
       John. “Oh you apostle John you trouble maker, you witch. We will burn you in oil, deny this
       faith that you cause all this trouble with or will burn you in this burning oil!” He said, “Put me in
       the burning oil because greater is he that’s within me then the fire and the oil.” And they took ole
       John and they put him down in the burning oil. And the bible said the oil never burnt him.
       History said, it never burnt him. Think about it!
        And ole brother John wrote, said, “Your brother John in tribulation on the island of Patmos
       for the word of God. Brother, he was called supernaturally. John was supernatural that they was
       afraid of him and banished him and put him on an Island of Patmos all by himself. Hallelujah!
       Glory to God!
        Them apostles and them early hundred and twenty people, they knew what they had received.
       And the people today, THEY DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY GOT! OH, HOW THE DEVIL
       HATH BLINDED THE PEOPLE! HOW HE’S CHAINED THEM IN FEDDERS, with unbelief.
       We’ll never be able to go in the rapture unless we come into CHRIST! WE’LL NEVER BE
       ABLE TO BE THE BRIDE until we come into HIM!
        And I think God that we’re living in the hour when GOD HAS LOOSED THE THREE
       ELIMENTS. The three elements have been loosed, TO BRING US BACK INTO THE SIDE OF
       THE LORD JESUS! AND THAT’S BY BOTH, THE WASHING OF THE WATER OF THE
       WORD AND THE BLOOD, Hallelujah! AND THE SPIRIT THE TOKEN HAS GOT TO
       COME TO THE BLOOD!
       Believing In Christ
       
       22
        Oh my! I can hear the spirit crying out of me one night and say, “COME INTO MY SIDE,
       MY LITTLE BRIDE!” I HAVE THE THREE elements on earth today, to bring you back to
       where you ought to have been in the first place.
        Water, blood and spirit, have been loosed from the opening of the seven seals. Oh, blinded
       people, are looking around and waiting for something to happen and it’s happening right now on
       earth and they don’t know it. That’s right!

       179 So I’ve watched for something. Has it slipped by us in humility and we’ve missed it? Is it
       gone and the church is left in her sins? If that be so, then it’s later than you think. If not, then
       there’s coming one with a Message that’s straight on the Bible, and quick work will circle the
       earth. The seeds will go in newspapers, reading material, until every predestinated Seed of God
       has heard It. None of them will come unless the Father has drawed them, and every one the
       Father has drawed will hear It and come. That’ll be, the predestinated Seed will hear the
       Word.

       out, when that other Seal was opened, the Zodiac mark of that place was cancer, the crossed

       466 How do you know, ’cause you’re a church member? Because, Christ is living through you,
       so pregnated with His Spirit that you—you’re a prisoner to anything else. You’re confined, oh,
       my, to the Gospel, confined to the Word, and all the children that you can bring forth is that,
       ’cause you’re a prisoner. 467 You can’t commit adultery; you’re already pregnated. Glory! He
       can’t take a hold. The womb of life is closed to anything else. You’re already His, by
       predestination. That Seed has come to Life; no world can get in. Oh! Oh, how we’d like to stay
       on this for about an hour! I’m sure you understand. See? Christ, and His alone, already finished.
       The Seed was there. The Seed was, already. When was It put there? “Before the foundation of
       the world, has predestinated us unto Eternal Life.” And as soon as the Life-giving flow, that Seed
       laying there…Other seeds that just would come in, wouldn’t take hold, just couldn’t do it, like.
       But when that Seed come in, quickly it stopped up the womb; all the rest of the seed was drove
       out, see, like that. 468 And you become a prisoner, surrounded, in Christ. Christ in you, His
       Life bringing forth His evidence, His signs. Oh, my, my, my! Look, bringing His signs of Life
       as a evident of His resurrection, proving to the world that Eternal Life, vindicates to the world
       that we’re alive in Him. And think of it, alive with God, our Redeemer, Who created us for the
       very same purpose, the Church, and His creative Life in us. 469 That is, Moses could said, by
       the Word of God, “Let there come,” and there come flies. A God can make flies can make
       squirrels. See? 470 He can do whatever He wants to. He can create. He can do anything. He’s
       God. The very same God, that creative Life, you see, that’s in you, can…You’re a prisoner;
       you can’t speak it till He says speak it. But, when you spoke, it’s God’s Word. He’s vindicated
       it to be so. Everything else is right, and He knows, when that’s spoke, it’s got to be so. See?
       471 Moses took his rod, and said, “Let there come frogs,” ’cause God said, “Let there come
       frogs.” He just transmitted it on out. That’s right. And frogs was in everything, everywhere was
       frogs. Where did they come from? Nobody knows. They wasn’t there before. But the Creator,
       God, working through a man, created things, a living species. 472 The very God that made the
       first frog can make the second frog. He makes all frogs. Oh, my! You see what I mean? Made the
       first squirrel, makes the second squirrel, make any squirrel; can make squirrels where there is
       no squirrels. He can do anything He wants to! He is God! He is God! His Life! Oh, my! When I
       think of it, makes me shiver! Uh-huh. 473 Oh, to live with Him, going Home with Him, to live
       Believing In Christ
       
       25
       with Him! Going Home with Him to live with Him forever, having Eternal Life! 474 This is
       God’s great mystery of love expressed, that God and man became one. See? The whole thing is
       God and man, one. God and man was one, there; and God and man is one, here. See? What is
       it? Being filled with His Spirit, Him having the preeminences. That was God’s achievement,
       that’s God purpose to do that: that He might be in Christ; and Christ in us; and all of us
       together, one. The Holy Spirit, same thing; It revealed it to Christ, reveals it here; the

       that’s a new Birth. Now what are you going to do when you get all that group together, where
       the revelation is perfectly in harmony, and God expressing it through His Word by the same
       actions, the same things that He did, making the Word manifest! Oh, if the Church only knew
       its position! It will, one day. Then, the Rapture will go when it knows what it is. Now notice.
       Think, what God has done for us here children. Take stock analyze the situation! What is it? God
       is expecting you to come up to this place, believing on him where this thing could take place.
       That’s what he’s speaking to us this morning, he’s wanting to do it! He’s close at hand.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 3 - The Ephesian Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.” How tragic it is that
       this first age did not listen to the Spirit. Instead it listened to man. But thank God, in the last age
       there will be a group rise up, the True Bride of the last day, and she will listen to the Spirit. In
       that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure Word and we will return to the
       power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ.
        Brother Branham said, she’ll have Thus Saith The Lord! Said, she’ll call for a billion tons of
       flea’s and get them if she wants to. Whatever she says it’ll be done. Why? Because it’s the word
       of the Lord coming from the mouth of God.

       for a hundred billion tons of flies if they wanted to. Amen. Whatever they say, is going to

       spiritual background.) Now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb, as we see the promised Land
       coming in sight. It’s nearing the time to be given. Joshua, in Hebrew, means Saviour, and
       represents the promised end-time leader to take the Church over. Caleb represents the true
       believer who stayed with Joshua. God started Israel as a virgin with His Word. But they wanted
       something different. So, did the last-day church.
       
        We rise up against that unbelief and kill it with the revealed word of God. And then when we
       get over on the other side brother will sing more than the song of Moses. What is it? When we
       get on the other side and we get In Christ we’ll sing a new song, that only the redeemed can sing!
       Amen!
        We sing, Amazing Grace, we sing, “Down at the Cross,” “The Old Rugged Cross,” “Let the
       Holy Ghost Come In.” But you believe Brother Bob and one of these days when God comes
       down and tabernacles himself in you, we’ll sing a new song. A song that we never sung before.
       Why the holy ghost down in there will sing a song through you.
        Brother Angels will stand all around this assembly and they’ll clap their hands with you. They
       won’t know what it’s about but they’ll clap their hands with you and they’ll rejoice. Because
       they know that your happy. And they’ll look on and we’ll be singing a new song. Why? Because
       we’re overcomers. We’ve overcome all the unbelief at the Jorden, we’ve crossed over into our
       promise and now we’re killing everything in sight! Every enemy that raises up we kill him. We
       put every enemy under our feet. Put it right down on the floor and put our foot right on it.
        Back in the olden days when you went out to fight, to meet the big Philistines and when you
       knocked him down you had your sword… Of course, you know it’s over and you know he’s
       gone. And then what you do is, you walk up there and put your right foot, right on his head and
       look at him and just cut his head off. Then that’s what God is gonna do with us, he’s gonna put
       the devil right under our feet. Put him right under your foot. Put your foot right down on him and

       and the State Police and fire department would be out there to see to it that only so many can get

       fell. You did run well. What happened to you?" But, "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem how oft would

       "How oft would I made you a flaming torch to the nations and to the world, but you accepted
       Hollywood. You accepted the fashions of the world. And now, you've been given over to a

       What is left? Nothing except Hebrews 12:26. "Whose voice then shook the earth: but now He

       God will shake the earth and with it shake everything loose that can be shaken. Then He will

       and there is only one place that can stand that shock, and that is in the fold of the Lord Jesus.

        Our precious Lord Jesus, we come to you tonight through thy shed blood Lord. And Lord,
       we’re so thankful to feel the reverence of thy people, the sweetness of thy holy spirit. It certainly
       is a great privilege and joy to stand before this great congregation tonight. Lord, I have children
       here of yours that are sick and afflicted here tonight. And I pray, that you’d honor thy unworthy
       servant’s prayer. And I pray, that all these sicknesses that’s upon these people with their hands
       up tonight, I pray God, that you will heal them each one, according to the word as thou hast

       holt to that promise. For we believe Lord that divine healing is in each one of thy children. We
       pray, that each one may be healed tonight. And oh, God, we pray that you will bless us tonight as
       we stand before thy judgment seat with fear and trembling. Bless us now for the remainder part
       of this service. In Jesus Christ name we pray, that every mistake every fault every sin may be put

       And in a couple of weeks, we wanna move the service to Wednesday night. So that, then if I feel
       led of the Lord, we can have some extra services during the week, add one here and one there
       and still give you a break. And it’ll kinda break the week up a little more. Because I think it’s a

       back after our solemn assembly. And a, it’s certainly has been a wonderful time, I know that
       something has supernatural taken place.
        I’m seeking the Lord now; I’ve been consecrating myself ever since we started this. Still
       waiting upon the Lord. But I know this, now I’ve heard from the Lord, I know that something
       has taken place. Now just for a witness of it, I’d like for all those…now don’t stand, don’t stand
       just because of me, but before the Lord. I want all those that know something’s took place down
       on the inside of you that’s been different since those meetings, I want you to stand to your feet.

       the week. How many felt it? How many feel that move back now? (Amen) I know, we-we got the
       victory over the enemy.
        And so, I certainly have appreciated the great power of the Holy Spirit that’s been in our
       midst. And everything was done, was led by the Lord Jesus. There was no mistakes, no mistakes
       everything was right on time. And it was wonderful that the Lord led us that way, cause it’s…
       certainly helped…How many helped each one of you? To show you, that is a total impossibility

       139 The hour is here when the Token Himself is identifying Himself right among us, and
       proving that He is the same Jesus yesterday, today, and forever, and He’s right with the Word.
       It’s got to be applied. A man that says he’s got the Token, deny this Word, then what about it?
       See, you can’t do it. The Token has got to be there. “When I…The blood shall be a token unto
       you.” Now the Holy Spirit, the Life that was in the Blood, is a Token unto you. Get to it in a
       moment, see. THE HOLY GHOST IS THE TOKEN. THE CASE IS CLOSED. Yes, sir. Now,
       remember. And I… 140 Doesn’t matter what you are, how good you are, how many times you’ve
       jumped up-anddown, how many churches you’ve joined, how many good things you’ve done, it
       won’t mean one thing to you if the Token isn’t applied. This is the evening time. That worked all
       right in the days of Luther, that worked all right in the days of Wesley, but it don’t work now. No.
       141 Yeah, keeping up the lamb was all right then. Those who died then before the lamb was
       applied, the blood, it was different. Yes, sir. They went on because of good conscious. They
       would be judged whether they—they were… 142 If they were predestinated, it struck them. If it
       didn’t, it don’t. That’s all. It’s just God. “He—He justifies who He will, have mercy on who He
       will, and He condemn who He will.” He is God. That’s all. “He has mercy on whom He has
       mercy, and condemns who He wants to condemn.” 143 A Jew could plainly show, by the
       
       3
       circumcision, that he is a believer. 144 There is many man, fundamental man, can take this Bible
       and say, “I am a believer, and Jesus said ‘by faith’ we are saved. And I am a believer, but that
       baptism of the Holy Ghost is nonsense.” Then the Token isn’t applied. No much, how much he
       believes, it’s annulled. 145 Just like the circumcision of the Jew. He say, “I’m a Jew. Why do I
       have to go out there and act like that other bunch of fanatics?” 146 Moses standing, up-anddown the street, saying, “The evening message is here! It shall come to pass, at the end of the
       fourteen days, you shall gather the congregation together and kill the lamb. The whole
       congregation of Israel shall kill it, putting their hands upon it, identifying themselves with it.
       And the blood shall be struck upon the post, and upon the lintel of the door, and, ‘When I see
       the blood, I’ll pass over you, for it’s a token that you’ve accepted the death of the lamb that I
       have provided for you.’” The blood was the token. 147 Now the Spirit is the Token. “YOU
       SHALL BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST NOT MANY DAYS HENCE.” AND WHEN
       THE BLOOD WAS SHED, THE TOKEN WAS SENT DOWN ON THE DAY OF
       PENTECOST, LIKE A RUSHING, MIGHTY WIND. 148 That was the theme of every apostle.
       That was, “HAVE YOU RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST SINCE YOU BELIEVED? Repent,
       every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and YOU
       SHALL RECEIVE THIS GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST, FOR IT’S A TOKEN, amen, that
       you’ve passed from death unto Life.” There you are. When that Gen-…Jewish church faded out,

       And I warn you in the Name of Jesus Christ; GET IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD now. That’s
       right. Don’t you fool about it. You press in, because there’s coming a time when you’ll scream
       and cry to receive the BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST; It’ll be shut off from you.
        Now, we are gonna be continually in a closer walk with the Lord Jesus, and that we might be
       ready at that chosen season that he will come. And then if a… if we’re not ready when he comes,
       
       4
       I believe it’ll be our own fault, because he’ll give each and every one ample time to prepare
       themselves for that great event.
        And so, we want to keep our assembly just as reverent, just as reverent as we possibly can.
       And course there are times when you have to whisper. There are sometimes when emergency
       arises with the children or something that you have to whisper and we understand that. But we
       should come under here with great expectation, that we are in the presence of a Jehovah God.
        And he is investigating our lives! And I believe that these few days the investigating angel,
       that supernatural presence that you felt pass by here investigating your lives, and He didn’t find
       that you were able to be sealed. If he’d of found it he would of sealed you! So, then you ought to
       be thankful because if he had sealed a couple, then it could of been Disastrous!
        And so, I know that you’re happy you’re pressing on. Now, I want you to try to see if you
       can’t find a prayer closet around your house. And you dedicate that portion or where you want to
       meet the Lord and you dedicate that to the Lord. And you go there and you fellowship with him
       and you pray and you seek him. And then if I feel led of the Lord, that you need help in opening
       assembly prayer meetings, why we will meet together again and we will have some open prayer
       meetings.
        But I’m hoping and praying, that you will press on to a individual close walk with the Lord
       Jesus. Now that’s-that’s the greatest thing that you could have is a personal walk with the Lord.
       For we know that one day you’ll walk alone with the Lord. You won’t have a group, there won’t
       be groups because the persecution will scatter you abroad, you’ll have to learn to walk with the
       Lord Jesus. So, that’s the desire of our hearts.
        Now, I’m just waiting upon the Lord. I see what I might say to you tonight.
       If you open your Bibles, if you want to open your Bibles to First Peter, 5:1 through 8. Now, just
       for a little exhortation here tonight. 1 Peter 5.
       1 Peter 5:1-11-Scripture Reading:
       1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the
       sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
       2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but
       willingly; not for [Money] filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
       3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
       4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not
       away.
       5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to
       another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
       humble.
       6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
       7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
       8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about,
       seeking whom he may devour:
       9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your
       brethren that are in the world.
       10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that
       ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
       11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
       
       5
       May God add a blessing to his precious word.
        I believe that the gates and the doors of hell have been slung open wide for all the demon
       power that has ever been created. And I believe that the great power of the devil is centralized
       against the people that are up around the revelation of God for this hour. All of the power that the
       devil has is against the man and the revelation and the people that believe the revelation of the
       hour. All of the demon power is around those people!

       exactly true. 126 Now, why does he hate a revelation? Why is he so against revelation? Is
       because that the entire canon of GOD’S WORD and God’s CHURCH IS SOLEMNLY BUILT

       And God knows, my hand to heaven, not ever dreaming of what was going on, in 1961 the
       Lord paid me a visit in Sarasota, Florida, that shook-up Sarasota, Florida brother, they never got
       over it. Great tent meeting going on and a great convention, and a little ole humble man like me
       not knowing it. And a man of God, Brother Osteen, was preaching. He looked at me and said,
       “God sent you here, I’m leaving.” That scared me to death, him being a great preacher and me
       just a little old hillbilly. I said, “Surely brother, not so. I have come to hear you.” And there he
       said, “No. God spoke to me.” He said, “He sent you here, I am leaving.” Oh, I had never preached
       before only to just a little teeny hand full that came out to hear an little ole ignoramus like me. And
       so there in the room that night with two missionaries …a missionary and a Jesus Name preacher
       in the room. There He came in the room and revealed to me. Oh friend, there is something….
       We’d better be ready. It’s gonna be terrible if you miss this. There God revealed to me, not
       knowing it, spoke to me with the same Voice that He spoke to Noah. I didn’t know the scriptures
       and spoke to me the same identical words almost that He spoke to Noah. He said, “The vileness
       and wickedness of man has come up before me, as stink in my nostrils and I can stay my hand
       any longer. I’m gonna pour out my wrath upon the people.”
       How many know that? In 1961 it went into books all over the world. (Also printed in Full Gospel
       Business Men’s magazine) They was gonna buy me an airplane and fly me all over the world and
       to the churches. And they got up and prophesied that I was Gods prophet, many of them did.

       that it’s going to be just that way, because God’s Bible said so. The other day, I made this
       statement to you: I said, “If God doesn’t judge this nation for it’s sin, He’s obligated to raise up
       Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize for sinking them.” Certainly. God’s obligated. He’s just,

        But while we’re waiting, and to those that are up around the revelation of God for this hour,
       my children let me tell you the devil is after you here in this assembly. I’m here to warn you in
       the name of the Lord! That if you ever put on the whole armor of God, if you ever found a prayer
       life, if you ever made up your mind that you’re gonna seek Christ with all of your heart, you’d
       better do it now. You better do it now, because Your Adversary the Devil is after you! He’s after
       you like a hound-dog after a rabbit. And you’d better find the grace of God in your life! You
       better find him and stay near him. You better watch every minute every hour of the day! You
       may be watching to see which way he’s gonna try to devour you. He has all kinds of tactics, all
       kinds of schemes.
       Ephesians 6:11-13-Reference quote:
       11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
       12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
       against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
       13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the
       evil day, and having done all, to stand.

       Hound-dog meaning:
       A hound dogs are traditionally used for hunting, excellent at tracking.
       Used as a southern expression. To hound-dog someone is to be persistent, relentlessly purse or
       pester them. “The devil is hound-dogin your trail.”
        And have I not warned you continually? Let God… That the devil our Adversary will not let
       us keep this blissful unity? Have not I’ve told you; that he’s got to send someone among you?
        And look a here, look a here, Oh my children! If we could only wake up and realize! We
       believe the Lord Jesus is God Almighty! We got a revelation that the Lord Jesus is God
       Almighty. But oh, we fail to have a clear revelation that the devil is Your Adversary and he’s out
       
       13
       after you! While you’re sleeping, he’s laying strategy against you, how he’s gonna get you. How
       he’s gonna stumble you the next day.
        And it’s often been said by Brother Branham, that the reason why he went out in the deserts
       and upon the high mountains, is because that the devil is almost completely harmless unless he’s
       got a body. So therefore, if you want to be alone with God and be away from the power of the
       devil, get away from people and you’re away from the power of the devil! But as long as you’re
       around people, then he’s got a chance…the Devil can use your best friend, your best neighbor to
       get at you with. He can use somebody that you think not, to plant a seed in your mind that will
       create a atmosphere the wrong…the wrong thought. And the wrong kind of thinking creates the
       atmosphere of the devil and BRINGS HIM on the scene.
        That’s why by your words are you justified and by your words are you condemned. That’s
       why we need to think right and speak right! If you’re thinking right, you’ll speak right. But if
       you let somebody come around and say the wrong word to you and you begin to think the wrong
       thought, immediately devil will anoint your flesh! The devil will, take advantage of you right
       there? And create an atmosphere around you, that’ll be evil. How many believe that? (Amen)
       That’s why we need to think right!
       Matthew 12:37-Reference quote:
       37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
        I believe this is the hour that men and women ought to stay along with the Lord Jesus Christ
       in prayer and in the word of God until they can become the word of God. Until they can think the
       word of God, until they can become the word of God! Every individual that goes in the rapture
       has got to think according to God’s word, has to talk according to Gods word, has to live
       according to Gods word and has to act according to Gods word! Until THEY become the word
       of God themselves. And that requires a constant presentient battle against our Adversary!

       Word…As the Bridegroom (being the Word), and the Bride (being the hearer of the Word),
       They come together in a Union. They unite like a wedding. See, They’re getting ready for a
       wedding, and They—They become One. THE WORD BECOMES YOU, YOU BECOME THE
       WORD. Jesus said, “At that day you’ll know it. All the Father is, I am; and all I am, you are;
       and all you are, I am. In that day you’ll know that I’m in the Father, Father in Me, I in you, and
       you in Me.” See? At “that day.” What day? This day! We find out the great hidden mysteries of

       Almighty as it has in these past months and year! We know that it is not man, it is not man, but it
       is the promise of the hour, coming to pass! Something has taken place! God is moving and He’s
       wanting to use individuals in this assembly. But God cannot deal with this church here as a
       whole! He’s got to deal with individuals. And God is gonna move with you, Gods gonna use
       you, Gods gonna give his promise to you, if you’ll move with God. You have got to move with
       God! If you want to move with God move with Him. But if somebody wants to come into the
       assembly, just to move with the assembly that’s not right! Every individual must let God move
       with them. And then we as individuals, as Gods dealing with individuals that come in here, then
       that’s something then. See!

       But upon this revelation, called-out group, I’ll build My Church in them. And all the gates of

       Mine! I’ll raise you up in the last day, give unto him Eternal Life, and raise him up at the last
       days.” There it is, the revelation. NOT THEM; BUT “HIM,” AN INDIVIDUAL! NOT A

       405 Now remember, you…We couldn’t get to the altar. Several held their hands up. Now, see,
       it’s an individual affair, with you. It’s whatever you want to do. See? 406 The hour is so close
       at hand, you ought to be pressing as hard as you could, NOT HAVE TO BE PULLED. See,
       just pressing, trying to get in, “Lord, don’t let me out. Don’t leave me out, Lord. The doors are
       closing; if I can just get in!” See? 407 God will close the door one day.
        See, but what have we got, we got the Great Revelation of God in our midst. Not man but
       God! Revelation of God, revelation in our midst and that is the Bridegroom.

       271 Now, there’s only one way to make It fail, that is, for you not to believe It. If Jesus stood
       here Himself and would pray for you, and go through the same act that we have done this
       morning, no more would happen. Or, if you would believe with the measure of faith, that, no
       more could happen than what will happen, if you believe with the same measure of faith.
       Because, I only represent Him. I’m a sinner saved by grace, just a man like you are, just a
       human being. But God has to have an outlet somewhere. And He’s proved that by His Word.
       He’s proved it by the ministry. He’s proved it by the Angel of the Lord. And here it is. Now it’s
       up to us, to believe it.
        While we been going along being… walking humble before the Lord…trying to walk humble
       before the Lord. We’ve been trying to endeavor, trying to keep the unity of the Holy Spirit in our
       midst. Getting along with one another in our daily walk, not offending one another in word or
       deed, trying to manifest the spirit of love. Trying to manifest the spirit of Christ. Christianity is
       what you do for somebody else. And each one of you has been trying to live that.
        And even as Brother Don said, “That he did not know of no other country, no other people
       across the country that live the life that you lived, that had the demonstration of Christianity as
       you have.” But listen! Just for Brother Don to say those words, makes the devil mad as all hell! It
       makes him mad and he wants to try to get at you. The more that, the more the people come and
       see how God’s blessing you, the more they come and feel the Holy Spirit in your midst and the
       more they go away and brag on you, all that does is send more demons after you. Brings…The
       devil says, “Bring up five thousand more demons real quick! Send them up there real quick!
       They’re pressing on and do the best you that you. Get around their beds in the morning! Get with
       them on the job, stand beside him. Be with him, stand right beside him, you can get him, you can
       make him stumble! You can make him say something he shouldn’t say! You can make him think
       something he shouldn’t think. You can make him act the way he shouldn’t act, stay right with
       him! Stay right with him!” That’s right!
        Let me tell you something brother and sister, the devil is a real devil, he’s a real live person!
       And his demons are real live! They’re real live! It’s not just in your thinking, there’s real live
       demon forces, there is a devil! And as your Adversary he’s out to devour you.

       63-0127 - An Absolute
       William Marrion Branham
       329 About two or three months ago, I was standing in the room. I heard a voice speaking in the
       corner. I tried to wake my wife, to look at it there. There, it’s been going before there, was a
       hideous thing standing there at the bed, accusing me. After He had told me…I had seen a big
       mamba running. That’s an African snake, and he was trying to kill people, and was after my
       brother. And I screamed out, “O God, what can I do?” 330 He said, “You been given power to
       bind him.” Said “Be of a good courage.” 331 I spoke to him. And his tail went up in the air, and
       whirled around, and, just like this pitcher handle here, and choked hisself to death. Blue smoke
       flew out of him. 332 Next morning, when I woke up, I was laying there. I said, “I better get up
       and take the children to school.” I looked over, and there was this hideous looking thing. Looked
       like it was Alley Oop in the funny paper, great big horns sticking out of it. He was going,
       sounded like a hen cackling, or—or singing, like they’re going from the barn. I looked at it. I
       
       17
       said, “Meda, Meda, honey.” And she didn’t wake up. 333 I thought, “Yeah, that’d scare her to
       death.” I waited there just a minute, and stand and watch. 334 People talk about devils, and
       don’t even know what they are, sometime. That’s right. But you run headlong into them, every
       day, maybe, but you will. Notice. 335 And after while, he was accusing me. Said, “You have no
       power with God. You’re just a bluff. You have no power.” 336 I said, “Satan, you’re an offense
       to me. Get out of my way, in the Name of Jesus Christ.” And he left. 337 I laid there a little bit,
       in the bed. Started to raise up, I felt a real sweet feeling come over me. I thought, “Wonder if the
       Holy Spirit now is close?” And over in the corner…So help me, here is my Bible over my heart.
       The sweetest Voice I ever heard in my life, said, “Don’t fear to go anywhere, and don’t fear to
       do anything, for the never-failing Presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go.” 338
       That settled it, with me. Let them rage. I got an Absolute. My anchor holds yonder, because it’s
       the Word of the living God. Amen. Yeah.
        And so, what I’m doing, I’m warning you in the name of the Lord, that if you’ve ever walked
       close to Christ, walk close to him now, because somethings happening. See!
        Oh, how we need to pray that prayer, Lord… humble yourself, sanctify the Lord God in your
       heart daily. Be prayed up every hour of the day! Be prayed up every hour of the day! Be led of
       the Holy Spirit every hour and every day! Be led by the Holy Spirit. Did you know, that if you’re
       not being led by the Holy Spirit every day, that if you’re not prayed up and you’re not
       consecrated to God and being led by the Holy Spirit every day that you are taking an
       organization life in you and he’s organizing you. We must be led of the Holy Spirit! Every day
       of our lives. We must be led step by step, step by step closer to the promise of the hour. How
       many believe that? (Amen)

       seeking whom he may devour:
        And I have got to warn this congregation! If I have ever in my life, for the past few days…if I
       ever seen the activity of demon power that’s trying to get at this assembly, has been in the last
       week.
        And listen! Whatever you do you make sure that you live above sin. Because this
       Revelation…if you don’t mean Business to go on with God… I don’t know how to say it! But
       when you come up around where that revelation is, you’re moving up around something where
       all the demon activity and all the power of the devil is at.
        Didn’t you realize, that if God didn’t have a office there and had not lifted that poor little
       brother up there to stand in that place he’d lose his mind? That no man could stand against the
       demon power that’s around that revelation, trying to destroy it! Then don’t you know that if you
       come and sit under that ministry that you’re right there, that you’re a target of every demon? You
       know that you never went through anything like you’re going through now, till you come up
       around this revelation. You got to hold the tiger by the tail and you can’t turn it loose! Because if
       you turn it loose it’ll eat you up! So, you just got to hold right onto the tail of the tiger. If you
       turn loose of it, then it’ll eat you up! So, you just gotta hang on for dear life!
        Let me tell you congregation…let me tell you something, before we get what I’m after, you’ll
       go through a TERRIBLE TRIBULATION before we get there. And only the gallant hearted,
       only those that have purposed in their heart, will never be able to stand such an onslaught of the
       devil!
        Oh my, let me advise you! That Satan has got to send someone in among us. Shoot that man
       full of poison and go over to your house and begin to sit down and shoot you inoculate you with
       that poison. Let me tell you something, I want you men to get back-bones in your back! Get a
       saw log in your back and when you see a man talk like that, grab ahold of his hand right then,
       and bring him to me, if you have to bring him by force! Don’t you sit there and entertain that
       spirit, and let that spirit KEEP INOCULATING YOU WITH THAT POISON! (Brother Lambert
       slaps his hands together.)
        Oh children, do you realize what I’m saying? Don’t you realize that-that devil is trying to get
       in here? And that’s why that I say for you men get you a job! Get you job, and get on your job!
       And then when you come in from work, you come in your house or little apartment or where
       ever it is, you eat your bread in stillness and quietness. And get down on your knees and seek the
       Lord Jesus Christ. And when you see strangers come in this assembly… now we got a stranger, a
       little brother back there. Now, we don’t mean that at nobody! But did not, when I come here, I
       was a stranger with you? And did not you prove me day in and day out, month in and month out
       and year in and year out? And if I’d of come here and told you the deep things of the Lord when
       I first come here, you wouldn’t of believed me and walked away from me and called me a
       fanatic. But you saw my life, you saw my life, month in and month in. And I wasn’t taking the
       oversite because of your money and because of your tithes, because I didn’t want them! And
       then you got confidence in me, and I built up confidence in me, that I loved you. And I wanted to
       feed your soul with good word of God, then you begin to lay holt to every word that I said!
        Have I ever laid hands on a man in here and ordained him as a deacon? (No) Have I ever
       ordained one elder? (No) No, why? Because that man must be proved, must be tested, must be
       tried.

        And then when… have not that I’ve told you that if the devil can stop this work of God here?
       If he can stop it, then he’s got to send somebody IN? We can’t open our arm’s, just open our
       arms, “Oh hallelujah, you’re a man of God,” you’re this and you’re that! No sir! You got to be
       aware! Let every man and every woman prove themselves, whether or not they be a child of God

       TWO POWERS IN ALL THE UNIVERSE? Of all of our differences between nations, and
       differences between each other, and everything, it all mounts up to two powers. There’s only two
       powers, and there’s only two kingdoms; two powers, and two kingdoms. All the rest, the little
       minor things, are connected with either one of those powers. AND THOSE POWERS IS
       GOD’S POWER AND SATAN’S POWER. That’s what…Every war, every disorder, everything
       
       20
       that comes along, it’s either controlled by God’s power or Satan’s power, ’cause that’s the only
       two powers there is. And that is the power of life and the power of death. Now, that’s the only
       two powers. 53 And Satan can only…His power, he’s got, is the perverted power of God. It
       isn’t no real power. It’s a perversion of God’s power, everything that Satan has. Death is only
       a perverted life. A lie is only the truth mistold. See? Adultery is a—a act misused, a righteous
       act misused. See? Everything that Satan has got is something that was perverted, but it’s a
       power. 54 AND WE ARE, TODAY, SETTING HERE, AND ONE OR THE OTHER POWER
       IS GOING TO CONTROL US. So let’s cast out the evil one. Let’s take our position like the
       stars of the heavens.
        Well, you say, “Oh, I know so much.” Let me tell you something Brother Sister, when you
       see somebody that’s a know it all and don’t have a humble spirit and bridle tongue, you know
       right there the devil will use a loose tongue. There’s nothing more deadly than a loose rattling
       tongue! The Bible said, “By your words are you justified, and by your words are you
       condemned.” If we ever was living in an hour… The bible said if you want to mature…if you
       wanna be mature, then bridle your tongue. For he’s that’s able to bridle his tongue has his whole
       body is in subjection and he's thereby able to grow up into the Statue Of A Perfect Man.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 1 - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       As I have already said, this Book (Revelation) is the consummation of the Scriptures. It is even
       placed exactly right in the canon of Scripture; at the end. Now you can know why it says that
       
       22
       anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed. IT IS THE REVELATION OF GOD THAT
       WILL GIVE YOU AUTHORITY OVER THE DEVIL. And you can see why they who would
       add or take from it would be cursed. It would have to be so, for who can add or take away from
       the PERFECT REVELATION OF GOD and overcome the enemy? It is that simple. THERE
       IS NOTHING OF SUCH PREVAILING POWER AS THE REVELATION OF THE WORD.
       See, in verse 3 a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this Book. I think
       this refers to the Old Testament custom of the priests reading the Word to the congregation in
       the morning. You see, many could not read so the priest had to read to them. As long as it was
       the Word, the blessing was there. It didn’t matter if it was read or heard. “The time is at hand.”
       The time was not at hand previously. In the wisdom and economy of God this mighty revelation
       (though fully known to God) could not come forth hitherto. Thus we immediately learn a
       principle — the revelation of God for each age can come in that age only, and at a specific time.
       Look at the history of Israel. The revelation of God to Moses came only at a specific time of
       history, and even more specifically it came as the people cried unto God. Jesus, Himself, came
       at the fulness of time, He being the complete Revelation of the Godhead. And in this age
       (Laodicean) the revelation of God will come in its due time. It will not falter, neither will it be
       premature. Think on this and heed it well, for we are in the end-time today.
        And let me tell you something, when you men go to one another’s houses and you sit there
       and you start breaking down this revelation to one another, supposing that you break it down
       wrong? Do you have an office down in there? Do you have an office from God almighty that’s
       able to catch that revelation and teach one another? (No)
       Then the Bible said, “Be not many teachers among your congregation. Knowing that ye shall
       receive the greater condemnation.”
       Come on now! When you gather together for fellowship and some of you raises up and begins to
       start, begins to start to explain the revelation, what you’re doing, you are making yourself a
       preacher whether you believe it or not!
       James 3:0-8-Reference quote:
       1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
       2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man,
       and able also to bridle the whole body.
       3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their
       whole body.
       4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are
       they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
       5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a
       little fire kindleth!
       6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it
       defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
       7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and
       hath been tamed of mankind:
       8 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

        And remember, if you add one word to the revelation or take one word away from it he’ll take
       your name out of the book of life.
        Let me ask you something children! My advice to you would be, don’t do it! It’s not worth it!
       Why should you take on the responsibility, that even I would gladly give it back to the Lord, if I
       could. Don’t you know that I don’t have no life of my own? That I got to stay on my knee’s night
       and day and afraid to even hardly eat or anything else, I live in such fear! Knowing what a
       responsibility is in my hands!
        And then some of you men just go out and let your tongue go loose, just as loose as I don’t
       even know how to explain it! You talk…talk things that you shouldn’t talk about! That
       revelation… God…that revelation of God is so sacred, that you should (Brother Lambert slaps
       his hands together) not even talk that revelation around one another! Be careful! Be careful! Be
       careful!
        If you ever prayed…if you love…How many love the ministry that God give me? (Amen) To
       try to make me a prophet, to try to make me something by verbally, from voice to voice…If God
       shows you something brother or sister personally about my ministry keep that to yourself, it’s not
       for nobody else but you! And what you do when you pass that around, you’ll make a cult out of
       this revelation. You’ll make a cult! And you’ll…
        And let me tell you something! The devil is after this congregation to turn it into idolatry.
       Don’t you know that if you get your eyes on me, and don’t get them on the Lord Jesus Christ
       you’ll be turned into an idolater?
       1 Corinthians 2:1-5-Reference quote:
       1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom,
       declaring unto you the testimony of God.
       2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
       3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
       4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
       demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
       5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

       times and miraculously escaped from them. But in 1958 in the spring and the month of April,
       1958, I was 28 years old and never had any denominational background, had no religious
       trainings, knew nothing of the Bible. I was just an ungodly sinner, but knowing that there was
       the hand of the Lord on me and I was running from him, running.

       didn’t know to call it spirit then, I didn’t know those things spirits blessings of God., prophets,
       apostles, preaching, gospel. I didn’t know none of those things. I’m just a sinner. I didn’t know
       what to say spirit! I just knew it was God, I knew that, the person talking to me was God. And that

       So I stay away in prayer. And I’d been away out praying, and, the first thing you know, when
       we…When I would eat, we come up to a little restaurant there, a little Dunkard restaurant, and a
       little ladies in there were such neat nice-looking, clean looking people, and they’d walk around
       very nice, ladylike, acting. And after while, this come Sunday, and they closed up and went to
       church. They were all very religious. And they closed up and went to church. So I got hungry; I
       wasn’t going to have a healing service that afternoon, so I was going to preach. And I thought,
       “I’d better go get me a sandwich, ’cause I haven’t eaten since a couple days before. I went over;
       the little restaurant was closed, so I just walked across the road to a common little drive-in
       place, ever what they call it. And as I walked in the door, there stood a policeman about my age,
       a man of about forty years old, with his arm around a woman playing a slot machine. And
       gambling is illegal in Ohio. They’re the law. I thought, “What is this world coming to?”
       Brethren, everybody’s afraid of communism. Everybody’s afraid that Russia is going to come
       over, Germany’s going to come over. Don’t be afraid of any nation whipping us. They’re not
       going to whip us; we’re whipping ourself. Our own morals is what’s polluting us. It isn’t the
       robin that pecks on the apple that hurts it; it’s the worm at the core that rots the apple. Our own
       morals among us, is what is killing us. Rejecting of Christ, living in—the life the way we do,
       that’s what’s killing us. 19 There was a policeman to uphold the law, standing there, perhaps, a
       married man with a bunch of children at home, playing a slot machine. I thought, “Oh, mercy.” I
       looked back at the back, a young waitress standing back there, very vulgarly dressed, and some
       boys half drunk with there arms around her, and doing things they ought not to do. I thought,
       “Oh, my. Let me get out of here.” And I happened to look to my right, and there set an old lady,
       old enough to be my grandmother, probably sixty five or better. She had on those foul clothes,
       little short clothes, and with the purple-looking stuff on her face, and her toenails painted the
       same way. Poor old thing, her skin was wrinkled and hanging, hair real close, and blue-looking
       color, where it had been gray, and all frizzled up. And I thought, “Isn’t that terrible?” And
       setting with two old men, and them drunk, one of them in summertime with an big army overcoat
       on. And I said, “Oh, my. I said, “God, how can You stand it?” I said, “Why don’t You wipe it
       off the face of the earth?” Then I was setting there thinking that, and all of a sudden something
       struck me, and the Lord said for me set down. And I went over in a corner behind the door and
       started praying. I thought, “Lord, it looks like that You’d just simply tear the whole…Will my
       little Rebekah and Sarah, my two little girls, have to be raised up here in the world under such as
       that?” I thought, “How can You stand it, when it makes a sinner like me shiver to think of such a
       thing?” 20 Well, I got back there and I saw a vision that changed my picture my altogether. I
       seen a world a turning. And I noticed around it was a streak, like red, all around. And I
       wondered what it was. And as I drew close I seen myself as a boy. And when I would sin, well,
       then I seen Jesus standing in front, between me and God, and His Blood act as a bumper.
       Every time I’d do anything wrong, it would hit Him. And He’d say, “Father, forgive him; he
       don’t know what he’s doing.” And I’d—I’d do something else, and then it was just like the
       bumper on a car to keep me. God can’t stand sin. The day you sin you’re gone. That’s all. But
       the Blood of Jesus was protecting me, the wrath of God from me, and my sin would catch it.
       And He’d say, “Father, forgive him; he don’t know what he’s doing.” And I looked, and I
       said, “Lord, is—is my sins treating You like that?” And the Blood running down His face…I
       looked, crawled up a little closer. And I seen a Book there, and my name was at the top, all
       kinds of sin wrote on it. I said, “Will You forgive me?” He touched His side and wrote
       “Pardoned,” throwed it over in the back, behind Him in the Sea of Forgetfulness. And I said,
       “Oh, how I appreciate You, Lord.” HE SAID, “NOW, I WAS WILLING TO FORGIVE YOU
       
       27
       OF YOUR SINS, BUT YOU WANT TO CONDEMN HER FOR HERS.” 21 That made a
       different question to me then. When I come out of the vision, I walked over to her. The men had
       got up and went out. I said, “How do you do?” She looked around hiccupping, and smoking a
       cigarette (which I think is the lowest thing a woman can do). And so she was smoking a
       cigarette. She said, “Oh, hello.” I said, “Could I speak to you just a moment?” She said, “I have
       company.” I said, “Not in that way…I’d just like to speak with you a minute.” She said, “Set
       down.” I said, “I’m a Gospel preacher, lady.” She threw her cigarette down. And I said, “My
       name is Brother Branham.” She said, “You’re not the man down here?” I said, “Yes, ma’am.”
       She said, “I’m sorry I’m in this shape.” 22 And I told her just exactly the vision I’d had. I said,
       “The Blood of Jesus, sister, still atones for you. As long as you’re mortal like this, you still have
       a chance to be saved.” But I said, “When you go beyond that Blood, you’re already judged.” I
       said, “Won’t you…” She told me her story, and it was enough to grind the heart of a stone man,
       how that she once was raised in a Christian home, an old fashion Methodist parent who went to
       church and did what was right. She married a husband; he started drinking. She had daughters,
       and they were even members of the church themselves. And how she’d took the road that was
       wrong. She said, “I’ve sinned away my day of grace.” I said, “Look, do you still have respect for
       the Lord Jesus?” She said, “I do, sir.” I said, “Then He hasn’t left you.” I said, “No, He’s still
       got mercy for you.” Said, “You think He’d receive me right like this?” I said, “Yes, ma’am.” I
       took her by the hand, knelt down there, that place, and brother, we broke that place up into a
       prayer meeting, when we led her to the Lord Jesus. Yes. 23 That’s it. We’re looking to see the
       people and how the Blood that crimson Blood, still around the world to protect whosoever will.
       You can get by now, because God can’t see you; you’re still under the Blood. But whenever
       you try to leave…You don’t know tonight you may have to take your journey away from this
       world. Then you go in the Presence of God, and you’re already judged. ’Cause you’re judged by
       the way you judged Him. Now, the red, when God looks down through red, He doesn’t see red,
       He sees white. “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white like snow.”

       common for, them preachers never heard it, just grabbed it set them on fire!
        I come up there the other morning there Mike, the Lord was giving him a dream and the
       presence of God was in the room. And Brother Don set up out of bed like a bolt of lightning,
       scared him the presence of God. See they heard things, they know, they’re spiritual, they got
       offices with God and they see that word line up there sets them on fire! I told Donald, “Donald
       whatever you do don’t breathe that! Don’t tell that! That’s not…not yet!”
        Don’t you see children, “My hour ain’t come yet.” I tried to keep all this a secret here, my
       ministry hadn’t started yet. But the thing about it, the Devils trying to get in front of it, to do it
       great damage before it starts out. What it’s doing, I got to exercise my gift you see.” See I can’t
       set at home… if God could put me off on a mountain the way my nature is. See, I couldn’t, I’m
       made up that way he couldn’t do that.

       was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the
       bridegroom,
       10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men
       have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

       Now if you have sat under this ministry here you know by now, without even a supernatural sign
       that it would have to be a supernatural one to reveal such things you’ve heard. How many raise
       your hands, you know that? Knowing a little fellow like me in such a short time would know all
       those things, it’s impossible. Mind you I have no background of the Word of God, whatsoever,
       none at all. But that God spoke to me, said that He’d give me these things all at once because He
       did not have time to train me and school me as he did his other servants. Then he told me some
       personal things, that I don’t think that it would be pleasing to the Lord if I revealed them to you. I
       don’t think I should say anything about it. Now notice, that I saw myself in the hospitals and I saw
       a ministry that was so, so stupendous and tremendous that it left me almost a hairline from insanity,
       when I come out of this anointing. I was almost insanity, from seeing the things that I saw. I saw
       a ministry. Now mind you that this is in 1958, that’s a good number too, 5 and 8. And it was on
       the 28th, I was 28 years old, and it was 58. All these things is for a reason. How many believe dates
       and everything have a meaning? When the Lord finished speakin, naturally I thought the world
       would come to an end. He said a short quick work, I thought maybe it would be the next night. I
       didn’t know. I was scared to death.
       Now when I come out of that trance, then as I came out of it, I realized that I was in this kitchen
       and the Voice stopped speaking. And the Voice spoke directly to the people (Joe and his mother),
       and talked to them just like I am talking to you, and then talked right to me. It’s like He called my
       own name, talked right to me.

       He told me of a most unusual ministry that I’ve found in the Word of God that I believe is to take
       place very, very soon. And He begin, kept right on speaking and told me said, “Because I’m not
       coming in years, I am coming soon. And because of this, I must give thee these things all at
       once. For I will make a short quick work upon the earth” How many know that the prophet of
       God (William Branham) told me the same thing, he told me the same words?
       Said, “I must give you these things all at once. I will not train, I will not send thee to school as I
       have my other servants, because I am coming soon, and I must give you these things all at once.”

       do the talking, you see.
        And then just…just… if you wanna fast and pray and seek the Lord, wonderful. You ought to,
       fast two or three days. Fast two or three days, wait upon the Lord hours, wait upon him lots. Wait

        See, those… I like that saying, “Don’t try to be so heavenly minded, that you’re of no earthly

       in heaven.”

       19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where

       where thieves do not break through nor steal:
       21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
       Now, how could you lay up any treasures in heaven if all of us go over and find out a big patch
       in the woods and go over and hide in the woods, none of us work? Now, supposing everybody in
       
       34
       the congregation that’s working say, “Might just as well quit?” Well, what’s-what’s gonna
       happen? Stop the program of God! You say, “God will create the food.” No, he won’t, he’ll let
       you starve. “Oh, praise the Lord, we got faith, we’ll go over there and God will create a loaf
       bread.” No, you’ll go hungry and you’ll starve. I’m telling you the truth.
        I know a sister, a good beloved sister of mine, Brother Branham said, “Sister you ought to

       the Doctor and let him cut that out!” She almost died. She should of went and got it cut out. Now
       what is she trying to do, trying to be so heavenly minded she was no earthly value? God wasn’t
       pleased with that. Now, it was just the mercies of God that he didn’t let her die.

       do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you,

       4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward
       thee openly.
       5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing
       in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say
       unto you, They have their reward.
       6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to

       They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long” Matthew 23:5 The
       religious leaders of Jesus’ day had strayed from God’s intention in the Law. Phylacteries were
       being made larger for the sole purpose of drawing attention to the wearer—the larger the
       phylactery, the more piety it supposedly showed. Ironically, the very command to honor the

       William Marrion Branham
       Now to—to me, and to the believer, any believer, this is either the truth or it is not the truth. It’s
       either right or not right. And if it wasn’t the truth I would be somewhere else tonight beside here.
       I would be here…If I was against Him I’d—I’d be preaching against Him, I’d be saying against
       Him. But I believe Him and I believe He’s—He’s the Son of God; I believe He’s raised from the
       dead. I’m for Him and ready to die for Him ’cause it’s the truth. And I know beyond one shadow
       of doubt that this is the Gospel and it’s the truth. And by God’s grace I can prove that it’s the
       truth. 27 And now, what we want to look at then, if Jesus has raised from the dead, can we see
       Him? “Sirs, we would see Jesus.” Now there’s only one way to do, and that’s go and see what
       kind of a Person we would look for. If you were going tonight to see Jesus, if Jesus was in
       Charlotte tonight, what type of Man would you look for? Would you go and look for some
       fellow that was way up in some great high cathedral with real priestly looking clothes on—walk
       out? Would that be the kind of Jesus you was looking for? If it is, He is certainly changed since
       He was here on earth the last time, for He dressed just like ordinary man. He went in among
       men, in and out among men, and THEY DIDN’T EVEN KNOW HIM BECAUSE HE
       LOOKED SO COMMON LIKE OTHER MEN; THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIM
       CONSPICUOUS ABOUT THE LORD JESUS TO LOOK AT HIM. He would do a certain
       thing; that’s the only way they’d know Him, by His miracles and the sign that He did on the road
       from Emmaus, after His resurrection. Do you see it? Cleopas and his friend was walking with
       Him after His resurrection, and He was so plain, yet, until they didn’t recognize Him until He
       done a certain thing like He used to do it before He was crucified, they recognized it to be
       Him. You see it? 28 Notice, He is not a man of great swelling vocabulary of words. He didn’t
       overdo the thing. And I’m going to give you a little between the lines, if you can receive it.
       Scholars today are all turned around: “This Greek word means this and that word means that.”
       
       36
       You know why? They are trying to make the Bible through the highest sphere of the Greek or the
       Hebrew, when Jesus didn’t speak His words big like that. The Bible said, “The common people
       heard Him gladly.”
       
        Why, I think to me, Brother Branham is a prime example for us to follow. I never did see
       Brother Branham, as many times I ever shook hands with him, when I went up and shook hands
       with him, I never did see him say, “Praise the Lord hallelujah!” Not one time did I ever do it!
       Not one time! Every time I ever met him, he’d say, “Why, Bob how are you?” He said, “You’re
       looking to me like you’re gaining weight boy! Good to see ya!”
        But you see, we try to impress everybody you know, people say, “if you don’t smile, praise
       the Lord hallelujah.” That’s the way Brother William, he’ll come over to the house, and… I’m a
       very serious person, I have to, a lot of times I have to make myself smile. Because I’m afraid
       people will say, “Oh, Brother Bob is really down in the dumps, I don’t know what’s the matter
       with him.” And a Brother William is a good example, he don’t mind me using him. He’ll come
       over, he says, “Brother Bob, have I done something to offend you?” “No!” “Is something wrong
       Brother Bob?” “No!” “Well, Brother Bob, you look so sad!” “I’m Happy!” But I’m serious. I’m
       serious, I’m sober minded. You don’t realize what it is, see. When more… the closer you get to
       God the less you smile and the more sober you become.

       But with God, it’s Eternity, so I must be deeply sincere with God. And then if I am sincere,
       He’ll hear me. But if I’m not sincere, there’s no need of me wasting God’s time listening to
       me. 71 And that’s where it’s come to today, amongst people, there doesn’t seem to be the depths
       of sincerity that—that they ought to have.
        Of course, you… I don’t believe now that we shouldn’t smile! Well, you ought to be the
       happiest there are. But I’m talking about me see, me! Would you like…would you like to stand
       in the place I’m standing and have the responsibility I have? See my mind is continually upon a
       serious thing. So therefore, it makes me so serious, I have to get a hold of myself to balance
       myself out. But you see, it’s not what you look at the outward appearance, that’ll fool you every
       time, you see.
        Now, we say, we have formed a religious habit of praising the Lord for things we shouldn’t
       praise him for. See when we meet somebody, “Praise the Lord hallelujah.” Well now, but you’re
       not really saying that sincerely! You’re saying that out of habit. It’s a habit! I know a certain
       minister said, “Well, I called a brother on the phone, and he didn’t say, “Praise the Lord, such a
       sour spirit.”
        Well, oh boy my poor ole self, a lot of times my mind is so occupied on the Lord even at my
       house, I’ll even forget to even shake hands. Even Brother Mike had to tell me the other day said,
       “Bob shake hands with Brother Hanley!” I wouldn’t of shook hands with him, if he hadn’t of
       said that. Because I was thinking about something, I my mind so on something, I forgot all about
       Brother Hanley because he was standing back there behind me. I had to turn around and say,
       “God Bless you Brother Hanley.” I’m glad he did! But let us… that doesn’t mean I don’t love
       brother Hanley, you see.
        How many is trying to get what I’m trying to say? (Amen) You see, every time I ever met
       Brother Branham, I never heard him say, “Praise the Lord hallelujah.” Now what it is, we
       can’t…that if we said, ‘Praise the Lord hallelujah’ to everybody I seen…that we seen, that
       wouldn’t mean we’re spiritual, would it? Huh? That doesn’t mean that we’re spiritual. See, but
       what it is, it’s what’s down on the inside! What’s down on the inside!
        But just be, try to be a Christian, and a Christian is, see what you can do to help somebody
       else. “What can I do today, Lord?” Remember, we’re laying up treasures in heaven. Right?
       Matthew 6:19-21-Reference quote:
       19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where
       thieves break through and steal:
       20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and
       where thieves do not break through nor steal:
       21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
        Supposing we just all stop dead, everybody quit work. Everybody quit work, nobody went on
       their jobs. And one day it’ll come to that, but you can’t make it before that day! All of us quit
       working and all of us quit our jobs and all of us moved out in the wilderness. Now wouldn’t that
       
       38
       be a fine testimony for the Lord? The Bible said, “He doesn’t light a candle and put it under a
       bushel.”
       Matthew 5:14-16-Reference quote:
       14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
       15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth
       light unto all that are in the house.
       16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
       Father which is in heaven.
        But thinking, all them grouchy sinful people you’re working around, how many of them are
       looking at your life going home thinking about you at night? How many of them women with
       their…with their mini-miniskirts on?
        They got something worse than that now coming from Paris, France! I wouldn’t even say
       what it is, such filthy nasty, dirty nasty talk, people are using it right in the Newspapers and
       magazines. I tell ya what’s the truth, I get sicker of a newspaper coming to my house every day
       and I can’t even stand to even look at the headlines. That dirty nasty filthy thing! I think I’m
       gonna keep them all from coming into my home.
        No, no, let your little light shine, let your light shine. Don’t never-never say one word unkind
       about nobody, say something good! Let me tell you something! That did you know… you know,
       just like a… a-a-a, love generates more love! Kindness generates more kindness. If you start
       being stingy, you’ll get more stingy all the time. And the more you give, the more you’ll want to
       give. The more you do for somebody, the more you’ll want to do for somebody. And you let
       somebody be real-real fussy and real mean and real grouchy, and you just make yourself say
       something kind, and then next time it’ll come easy, come easier and easier. The more love you
       manifest, the more you will manifest.
       1 Peter 4:7-10-Reference quote:
       7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
       8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the
       multitude of sins.
       9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
       10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good
       stewards of the manifold grace of God.
        And if we can just do that, be normal people, just try to be as normal as you can see.
       In otherwards, if people come into our assemble to visit, we won’t…don’t nail them in your
       house as soon as you can. You know, don’t do that! Just let them see just a sweetness, such a
       dedication in your home.
        It’s just like, I never got up and said, “Now, somebody…preachers are coming if you sisters
       would like to bake a cake or pie or something to help sister Shirley.” We was over there and we
       had a house full of people and here come a cake, here come a pie, here come a ham, here come
       chicken. Here come this here come that! And I seen two preachers’ brake down and cry! Their
       wives broke down and cried, the little girl broke down and cried. Said, “I have never seen such a
       display of Christianity in all my days.
       
       39
        Now, what is that? You’re laying up treasures in heaven, your lights are shining! That was
       light shining!
        And then cried, cried and cried! And look at Brother Ruddell (Donald Ruddell, Jeffersonville
       Ind.) got up and said, “Now, I have prayed that God would give me that type of assembly, and he
       answered my prayer. Because I always manifested that and tried to live that kind of life, full of
       hospitality and a giver.
        And God blessed me with that kind of people and that kind of spirit. Let us…let us strive unto
       more of that. I don’t know any greater man of God that walks the earth then Brother Don
       Ruddell, Brother Mike Canada. (Gainesville, Georgia) And He said, “That he… as much as he
       loves,” you know he loves his sheep… he said, “That these sheep here far surpass even his own.”
        How many…And did you know, that before it’s over, that if you’ll go on and stay humble and
       sweet and stay just like you are, don’t you know that one day will be… don’t you know that your
       names here in this assembly will be noised around the world. And people will long to come and
       just spend one day in your midst. How many realize that? How many want to be that kind of
       Christian? (Amen) God help us to stretch forth to that see.
        See, now-now, it-it kinda makes it a little sticky to talk on some of these little things like that.
       But we’ve got to be aware of new comers coming in until we see…of course it’s…it’s
       preaching… it’s sad and I don’t want to say it, but I’m a preacher. And I know if the devil can
       get somebody that thinks he’s a preacher, he can do great damage with it. There’s a great danger
       to think that your called when you’re not! Because the devil… You’ve got to be really sure that
       you’re called! And you’ve got to watch that, because the devil will really lay it on us. See so,
       leave the preacher, leave the preaching to the preacher. And let…

       you see where I’m going. One child, that’s all it took. It took one child to shake the nations and
       point to the Messiah. Took one, obedient. That’s right. GOD JUST NEEDS ONE MAN.

       WANTS, TO GET ONE MAN IN HIS CONTROL. OH, HOW HE LOVES TO GET ONE

       72 And what we need today, in our seminaries, it’s not so much theology to be taught, but a
       burning bush experience, where men get down before God and meet Him face to face. We
       need a challenger today like we had in that day. What we need is man and women who has met
       God, and know what they’re talking about. Not somebody trying to teach from some church
       book, or some open theology. WHAT WE NEED TODAY, IS A MAN THAT’S BEEN IN THE
       PRESENCE OF A BURNING BUSH, HAS BEEN BORN AGAIN, AND CHANGED AND
       MADE A NEW CREATURE. That’s the type of person we need today. That’s the kind of
       person that will stay on the firing line, regardless of what comes or goes.
        Now, watch this here! Now, just let me show you something! Alright! Let’s supposing a
       brother has a true revelation, he has a real true revelation, of what I’m trying to get to you. And
       he comes over your house and he begins to try to explain that to you. Let’s say he tries to explain
       it to you. And then you try to explain it back to him and he says, “I believe you got it now.” Do
       you know what you got? You got a third hand religion! You done past'er down two ways and
       now you got a third hand religion! How many say amen? (Amen)
        But now, look here! Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God, from the man God
       called to handle it. Listen now! “The word of God is of no private interpretation.” No one has
       any right, no right whatsoever to try to interpretate the revelation of this hour! God is his own
       interpreter. And it has to be God doing the interpreting. And then if it’s God doing the
       interpreting, then it’s perfect.
       2 Peter 1:20-Reference quote:
       20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
        But then if it’s handed down to the congregation, and they begin to hand it to one another then
       it’s done changed two or three times. And then what you got? And then you warp that persons
       thinking.
        When if everyone will sit in the congregation and keep hearing that ministry, keep hearing
       that ministry coming forth and then when that Holy Ghost over shadows them, drops down in
       their heart a revelation, they’ll have it just like the preachers got! By a revelation from God!

       26 Now listen closely, before closing. “How can I escape it, brother?” Neither male or female is
       accepted or dispelled. You’re all one in the sight of God, when it comes to this. How do you do
       it? 127 Your heart is a womb. You know what I’m speaking of, women and men. Your heart is
       the womb. AND THE WOMB HOLDS THE SEED, AND THE SEED IS THE GOSPEL.
       Now, the Seed, alone, in its heart; no matter how many Gamaliels you sit under, no matter how
       great your pastor is, and how much you’ve read the Bible; It’ll never take Life until the germ of
       Life has come to It. 128 A woman’s seed is a wonderful thing. It’s the building of the body, but it
       has no life. It can’t. It’s impossible. It has no life, to begin with. So, no matter how much you
       know the Bible, and how well it is in your heart, you’re still a sinner. 129 Now what happened?
       The heart is the womb, and faith cometh by a open ear that’s not been sealed by theology.
       FAITH COMETH BY HEARING, TO HEAR. THE WORD COMES INTO THE MIND.
       YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT IT. “Is That right? Could That be right? Well, the
       Bible said so. I believe It.” Whoosh! Down in the heart It goes. Then, It’s a womb. Then the
       Male sect…We are the Bride, the woman. The Seed goes into the Church. 130 THEN THE
       MALE SECT, WHICH IS THE BLOOD CELL, THE BLOOD OF CHRIST IS APPLIED.
       AND IN THE BLOOD COMES THE GERM OF LIFE THAT GOES INTO THE SEED
       AND BRINGS FORTH a newborn baby, crying, “Abba, Father! Abba, Father! My God! My
       God, why did I ever do those things? My God! My God!” There you are. 131 THE LITTLE
       WOMB HERE IN YOUR HEART, WITH THE SEED, this morning, falling into It, won’t you
       open your eyes, won’t you let It fall (not from your mind) down into the womb of your heart?
       Men and women, alike, there is neither male or female in this kind. Both of you has got a heart.
       Let It fall down here, and say, “Well, sure, that’s the Truth.”

       124 But to those who know what It is, oh, what a blessing! WHAT IS IT? A REVELATION. A
       REVELATION OF WHO? Of the man on the pulpit? Of Jesus CHRIST in this last church
       age, revealing himself like he promised he would do. See? 125 IT’S A REVELATION, SEE,
       AND SATAN HATES THAT. My, how he hates it! He’s exposed, exposes his plan. Satan
       hates the Revelation and Genesis, I got wrote down here. That is exactly true. 126 Now, why
       does he hate a revelation? Why is he so against revelation? Is because that the entire canon of
       GOD’S WORD and God’s CHURCH IS SOLEMNLY BUILT UPON REVELATION.
       
        But then if you try to hand it back and forth… You know how they play that game, where
       you stand about ten together and then you whisper something to the man behind you. And then
       he whispers to the next person and then watch it when it gets around to the last person. It’s so
       warped out of meaning; it ain’t nothing like the phrase that was first spoken. That’s the same
       with this.
        Let this revelation be of no private interpretation, but let God interpret it. God is his own
       interpreter. Right?
       2 Peter 1:20-Reference quote:
       20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
        Now notice, I want to ask forgiveness to this congregation! I… it seems though that it’s true,
       that the pastor sets the example, and my family hasn’t set the best example as far as school is
       concerned. I believe that the children ought to go to school, however I have built up in myself a
       fear'st resentment toward the schools. Because of the fact that they take out everything that I try
       to put in my own children. But let me tell you something! I believe that every child in this
       congregation ought to be the best student in school and make the best grades that can be made.
       And my-my boy and girl knows that I sure enforce that. And I say, if they get bad conduct on
       their report card and bad grades and they hear from me about it. And when they make good
       grades, I certainly reward them. I try to give them a dollar for every A, course Timmy like to
       broke me, I had to come down to fifty cents. And then I noticed his grades started failing again,
       so I had bring them up to a dollar and then he brought them up.
        But what is it? What is it? Now supposing…now did you know already that the school board
       and the system looks at the long hair and sixteen years old and they’re quitting and they say,
       “Aw, you go to that assembly up there in Durham.” That’s no testimony for the Lord. No
       testimony for the Lord at all. I’m not…I’m not against education! I believe we ought to have
       some education. And we all can’t just give up, and all of us quit going to school and quit this quit
       that. The Lord wants our children to be a light at school. However, now my son Mark he just
       didn’t fit in school at all. So, I would rather…he couldn’t…even though he killed his testimony,
       
       44
       he don’t have no testimony at school whatsoever, he sure killed it. Now, I say the good along
       with the bad. He killed his testimony, he don’t have no testimony at school. But I want my son
       Timmy to be the best testimony that he can possibly be. See!
        And say, “Well, we ain’t got know heart to go.” Well, the brethren ain’t got no heart to work
       but they go on working anyway. Because the Bible says, “He that don’t work let him not eat.”
       Work that you might…and if you don’t need the money, work that you might give it away to
       some other brother, help him pay his bills off.
       Sure, it’s hard to go to school! Sure, it’s hard to do anything out in the world. But that’s where
       the people need to see you.
       2 Thessalonians 3:10-Reference quote:
       10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work,
       neither should he eat.
        God is wanting a tabernacle. God is wanting a light to shine out in this perverse generation.
       And if we all come and hide our light, it’s not gonna do any good.
        So, mothers and fathers see to it that you children make the best grades that they can possibly
       make. See! Course, now if you wanna take your child out of school and they’re sixteen that’s up
       to you. That’s up to you! But it’s not the criterion of this assembly, that every, get every boy and
       every child out of school as soon as you can. See! And I may have of been guilty of that by
       something I said, so I pray that you’ll forgive me. The Lord brought that to my attention, that’s
       not right!
        You remember, Brother Branham made Joseph spend the summer in school and a extra
       teacher…hired an extra teacher to bring his reading up.
        Now, but I’m not advocating…I’m not advocating going to Collage, in fact I doubt…
       I’m looking for the Lord Jesus to come any minute. But until he comes, let us try to be the best
       example at school, on our job.
        The Bible said, “Whatever you do in word and deed,” … If you’re working a deed going to
       school and you got a test coming up, then mommy and daddy ought to get down and say, “God
       help-help my son make the best grade in class.” That’s the way it ought to be. Whatever you do
       children here in this assembly, whatever you do in word or deed in school or mommy or daddy
       on a job, momma doing your house work, daddy on his job, whatever you do in word or deed do
       it all in the name of Jesus. You wash dishes, wash dishes in Jesus’ name. You’re serving your
       husband, serve him in Jesus’ name, because when you’re serving your husband, you’re setting a
       plate before the Lord Jesus. And, remember he’s watching ever bit of it.
       
       Colossians 3:17-Reference quote;
       17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
       God and the Father by him.
        You know when we’re born, when we’re born down here on earth, the Lord puts the record
       on, he cuts a record. He assigns a angel to you and he cuts a record and he puts the needle on,
       and it starts playing. At first there ain’t much on it, (Brother Lambert makes a sound of a baby
       crying) And later on it goes on about a year in a half awhile what happens then it, “Dada,” that
       goes right on tape. Then, “Mama, milk, milk. I hungry,” It’s getting a little stronger all the time
       ain’t it? (Amen) Uh ha! And it also on there when you dropped the cookie jar and stole the
       
       45
       cookie to, and that goes right on there. And now it’s spinning right on there and everything that
       you say, every time you bat your eye, every time go got town. Every little thing that you do
       shady. You steal a little cookie jar; you steal a little dime out of the dresser and you done this
       you done that. That’s going right on Gods record and Gods television. And when you get up to

       19 That isn’t so with Jesus. No matter how little you do, He knows everything that you do. It’s
       recorded in heaven, just as much for your account as it is Billy Graham’s, or Oral Roberts’, or
       any of the rest of them that has great meetings. It’s not the big things sometimes we do; it’s the
       little things we leave undone.

       107 God’s omnipresence knows what you’re doing, and even your thoughts. One time while I
       was in a vision, I was speaking to a Being standing by me; and He said back, HE SAID, “YOUR
       THOUGHTS ARE LOUDER IN THE HEAVENS THAN YOUR VOICE IS ON THE
       EARTH.” He knows what you’re thinking. You might say you—you do this and you do that, and
       it, but, you see, down in your heart, if you think different, you’re—you’re doing something
       wrong. You should be just what you are, see, the—the heart. The mouth should speak what’s in
       the heart. See? And so we find that the people doesn’t realize the—the Presence of God.

       355 Won’t you come? Once more I ask you. In where…Here or around the nation, I ask you,
       wherever you are, in what assembly you are, at this thanksgiving hour. Remember, I’m being
       taped here; not only here, but in Heaven. 356 You know, it’s scientifically proved that every
       move you make is recorded. They prove that. Remember, television proved that. The television
       doesn’t—doesn’t manufacture the picture. You’re the picture. It just transmits that, what you’re
       doing, into a channel. You’re there, anyhow. See? When you move your finger, that move goes
       around the world. Every time that you put on a dress, your looks goes around the world. It’s on a
       record. Every thought that goes through your mind is on a record. And someday the record is
       going to quit playing, it’s going to be put in the album. 357 And then at the Judgment it’s going
       to be come back. There you stand with bobbed hair, claiming to be a Christian. There you stand
       with thoughts in your mind against the Word, and it’s right in your mind. You can’t hide it.
       Remember, television, science even knows that’s true. You standing right now, knowing that
       you should be here, remember, when this is recorded, at the Day of the Judgment, that same
       thought that you’re having will be coming right back through your mind again. That will be
       right on record. The whole world will see it played. Why don’t the world…Looking at you, on
       
       46
       the Day of the Judgment, all the Angels there. 358 “If you’re ashamed of Me here, when your
       picture is being made now, at the Day of the Judgment I’ll be ashamed of you. For, I anointed
       My Word, sent It to you. You wouldn’t believe It. You hid yourself behind something.”
        Now, if you never get saved and the blood of Jesus Christ has never been applied to your
       soul, when you die, God pulls the record off, God takes the television picture and he shoves it up
       in a great big rack in heaven to wait for the white throne judgement. And when you come up
       before the Lord God at the white throne judgement, brother or sister and if that man or woman is
       not saved, there they come up to the White Throne Judgement. “Your name?” “Bob Lambert.”
       The angel goes over there, Bob Lambert. Reaches up gets the record, the life-time record, gets it
       out. He puts it on his tape recorder, his record player and she begins to spin. First you hear,
       “Dada-mama,” Bob Lambert. The next thing you know, there is all my wicked sins and every
       evil thought, ever woman ever this. Whatever wicked thing I done, drinking, smoking, stealing,
       right on there she goes. And when she finishes, the day I died it’s taken off. Then you know the
       answer, “Depart from me into everlasting fire and torment.
       Matthew 7:22-23-Reference quote:
       22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
       name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
       23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
       Matthew 25:41-46-Reference quote:
       41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
       everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
       42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
       43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison,
       and ye visited me not.
       44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a
       stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
       45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of
       the least of these, ye did it not to me.
       46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
       Revelation 20:11-15-Reference quote:
       11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the
       heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
       12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and
       another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things
       which were written in the books, according to their works.
       13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead
       which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
       14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
       15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

        So, whatever we do in word or deed, that us all do it in Jesus Name! But I thank God, I thank
       God that when my filthy soul was dipped in the Holy Blood of Jesus Christ, GOD PICKED THE
       RECORD OUT AND BROKE IT AND CAST IT IN THE SEA OF HIS FORGIVENESS! They
       ain’t spinning no record for me. He put it down in the sea of his forgetfulness and there’s no
       record there on me at all.
        What did he do? He sent forth the Holy Spirit and went out there and caught every dirty word
       that I ever said, caught everything I ever said and he went out after it. And he annihilated every
       word that I ever spoke! Put it on back to the time I was conceived.

       262 He, the Bridegroom, took away your shame, “And put it in the Sea of Forgetfulness, by
       the washing of the Water of the Word and the Blood of Life.” That’s what the Bible said. Your
       first husband that you were married to, the world…The anointed Bridegroom, which
       foreordained you, has washed you by the washing of the Water. By “the church”?
       [Congregation says, “No.”—Ed.] That don’t sound right, does it? [“No.”] You might find that in
       the almanac, but not in God’s Bible. “BY THE WASHING OF THE WATER BY THE
       WORD.” IN THE WORD! SEE? BY THE… 263 YOU ARE STANDING COMPLETELY
       JUSTIFIED, AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT AT THE BEGINNING. This is my Message
       to the Church now. As you…as we go off the air, just in a minute. You are standing, if you’re
       standing on God’s Word and with God’s Word, every amen, every jot, every tittle. Where you
       standing? I’m trying to tell you, pull away from them shucks. And get out here in the wheat,
       where you can get ripe before the Son. I hear the coming of the combine. YOU’RE STANDING
       COMPLETE, JUSTIFIED, LIKE YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
       HALLELUJAH! 264 Talk about a thanksgiving! I feel real good. I’m more thankful for that
       than anything I know of. 265 YOU ARE THE PURE, VIRTUOUS, SINLESS BRIDE OF THE
       SON OF THE LIVING GOD. EVERY MAN AND WOMAN THAT’S BORN OF THE
       SPIRIT OF GOD, AND WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, AND BELIEVES
       EVERY WORD OF GOD, STANDS AS THOUGH YOU NEVER SINNED AT THE FIRST
       PLACE. YOU ARE PERFECT. THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST! How can you…If a man…
       266 If I was supposed to die in the morning, a man took my place, I cannot die for that sin.
       Somebody took my place. 267 AND JESUS, THE WORD, TOOK MY PLACE. HE BECOME
       ME, THAT A SINNER, THAT I MIGHT BECOME HIM, THE WORD. Amen. Let me hold
       true to It, not the church. The Word! Amen. 268 Oh, that spiritual union of Christ and His
       Church now, when the flesh is becoming Word, and the Word is becoming flesh, manifested,
       vindicated. Just what the Bible said would happen in this day, it’s happening, day by day. Why,
       it’s cumulating so fast out there, in those deserts, and things taking place, that I couldn’t even
       keep up with it. We’re near the Coming of Jesus, to be united with His Church, where the
       Word becomes the Word. Call of the Holy Spirit, searching the hearts! 269 YOU’RE
       STANDING, COMPLETELY. YOU NEVER SINNED AT THE FIRST PLACE. GOD DON’T
       EVEN KNOW. IT’S IN THE SEA OF FORGETFULNESS. YOU NEVER DID IT. You were
       accused of it, by the accuser. But really, from the beginning, you were predestinated to be a
       
       48
       son and daughter of God. You’re standing there, washed. AND YOUR OLD BOOK OF
       DIVORCEMENT IS PUT AWAY, AND IT’S DEAD, ABSOLUTELY OUT OF EXISTENCE,
       EVEN IN THE MIND OF GOD. 270 YOU’RE THE VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF CHRIST,
       WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. PRECIOUS, VIRTUOUS, SINLESS SON OF
       GOD STANDING WITH A PURE, UNADULTERATED BRIDE-WORD THAT HE
       WASHED BY THE WATER OF HIS OWN BLOOD; THAT BECOME FLESH AND
       MANIFESTED, THAT HE MIGHT TAKE YOU WHICH WERE PREDESTINATED IN
       THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER, BEFORE THE BEGINNING, THE SAME AS HE WAS.
       HE WAS THAT GREAT ATTRIBUTE OF GOD, CALLED “LOVE.” 271 Whatever you are,
       you are servants of God, whatever God wants you to do, where your place is. “God placed in the
       Church, some apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors…” He placed that by virtue of His Own
       predestination. And you were that, to begin with. 272 Your first wedding was annulled. It was.
       You never done it, in the first place. Because, there’s only one thing could do it, that would be
       God come down, Himself, and took your place in a form of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and
       washed you by the Water, of the washing of the Water by the
       Word. The Word; not the denomination! The Word washed you. But if you won’t stand in the
       Water of the Word, how you going to be washed? You’re still as spotted as Eve was. Oh, dear
       dying Lamb, Thy precious Blood Shall never lose Its power, Till all the ransomed Church of God
       Be saved to sin no more. 273 What is sin? Sin is “unbelief.” Unbelief in (what?) the Word;
       unbelief in God, which is the Word. 274 Pure, unadulterated; oh, hallelujah; leaving soon for the
       skies; amen; standing ready. Think. Your garments, washed by the Water of the bleeding Word!
       The Word become Blood. The Word bled for you, and you are washed in bleeding Word. The
       Word, bleeding! The Life of God in the Word, and the Word was bled for you, that you might
       be washed from the filth of these prostitutes, and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of
       the Water of the Word, and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on His Word. 275
       Now, how you know It’s true? When God comes down and vindicates It and prove.
        Now…now what is he doing? He’s standing for me! Oh, I just love his presence right now
       around this pulpit! I’m so thankful THAT HE COVERED MY SINS in the Blood of the Lord
       Jesus! Put it in the sea of his forgetfulness. Now, he’s standing for me, and I’m just as sinless as
       God is! I’m Just as Holy as God is! I’m Just as Righteous as God is! I got His Righteousness and
       I got His Holiness, I got His Perfection, and I got All things in Christ Jesus! Amen!”

       10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for
       all.
       11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices,
       which can never take away sins:
       12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand
       of God;
       13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
       14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
       15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
       16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
       laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
       17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
       18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
       19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
       20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say,
       his flesh;
       21 And having an high priest over the house of God;
       22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from
       an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

       trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
       20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you
       in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
       21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
       righteousness of God in him.
       
        And then when he resurrected, when he died at Calvary, I died with him! And when He went
       to…and when he went to the grave, I went to the grave with him. And when he descended down
       into hell, he went to hell for me. But when he rose up out of that Triumph with the keys, to death,
       hell and the grave and ascended on high, I ascended on high with him. And now potentially, we
       are all sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus our Lord. Passed from death unto to life.

       Now there I laid dying with a wife and three children. We just had my little new born baby.
       No money, and in a strange town. I had one friend. I called up the friend my wife did to come to
       my bedside to see me and to take her home He didn’t even think enough of me to even come after
       her…my wife. He didn’t know it, but that was the end of it to me! That killed me and broke my
       heart. I thought my last friend that don’t care enough about me to come to my bedside and me
       dying. So, I said to my wife I said, “If I did live, if I did live through this, I don’t ever want to see
       
       51
       a human being again!” So, that just the way the Lord has to bring you to the end of your road. So,
       I find out there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother. Thank God for Jesus.
        Though I fail, he won’t! Though I fail he won’t! He’ll never fail! Ain’t that wonderful? What
       greater thing could you have? Then to know that the Lord Jesus has washed away our sins.
        Some man said, “Oh, I tell yea Reverend Lambert,” Said, “I ain’t afraid to die.” I said, “You
       will be!” “Not me, I’m ain’t afraid to die.” I said, “Let me tell you something mister. You don’t
       know what you’re saying, you don’t know what you’re saying.” I said, “You know what happens
       to you when you die?” I said, “I wanna tell you!” I said, “When you lay down in that ole bed and
       the doctors say, you got five minutes to live. There’s gonna be and ole devil walk up to your
       bedside and you might see him. You will see him! From the time that your heart beats the last
       beat, you’re gonna see that devil, and he’s standing there by your bedside. And then what he
       does, he reaches down and takes a big chain and wraps it around you and locks your hands in it,
       your soul. And you hear them ole chains raddling.” And I said, “There he takes you when you
       come up out of that body, and he leads you into darkness.” And I said, “Now, you don’t have no
       blood of the Lord Jesus applied to your soul, so, you can’t go in to heaven where the saints are
       at.” And I said, “You can’t go down to the lake of fire yet and burn because you got to be judged.
       You can’t go to heaven and you can’t go to hell.” So, I said, “You know what’s gonna happen to
       you? Your gonna wonder around in another dimension, where murderers, whoremongers,
       adulterers, fornicators and thieves and gangsters and reprobates and queers and agnostics and
       sodomites and homosexuals and every evil spirit that’s ever on Earth, you’re gonna be rubbing
       shoulders with them. Until one thousand years is up, and whatever space of time you got left,
       you’re gonna be there in horror and agony and pain and in torment. And all of yea know that
       you’re lost and you’re waiting for the great judgement. And you know…and the worst part of it
       is, you know what your answer will be.” He was a different fella then. (Brother Lambert knocks
       on the pulpit many times)
        Aw friend, don’t never, don’t never go that way! Now you can tell… “Well, what kind of
       shape am I in?” Whatever is pulling you, that’s what shape you’re in. If there’s something
       pulling you back into the world, and to the things of the world, then you’re going to hell. But if
       somethings pulling you toward something Holy and Righteous… Can’t you see that? “Am I
       gonna be saved?” Well, look at you and see, what’s pulling you? Why are you here tonight?
       Why are you thirsting for God? Because there is a magnetic love of God is pulling you to
       heaven. And what happens? If you die, when you lay down and you die, that glorious angel of
       God just sucks you right out your body and takes you right into a glorious place. You’re walking
       toward it right now! “You’re walking toward that city whose builder and maker is God.”
       Hebrews 11:10-Reference quote:
       10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
        As we often say, the way that you cut your tree that’s the way it falls. See! You let…you let
       these boys out here… it’s like I said, “You start letting their hair start getting a little bit long,
       alright that’s a force.” It’s a force pulling you away from the good force. You call it bad force
       and a good force. The bad force starts pulling you away. They start letting their hair get a little
       long and they start tearing their britches. Or the woman starts trimming their hair, shorten their
       dress. Or whatever it is, it’s just a little thing. One little thing leads to another little thing. One
       
       52
       little thing leads to another little thing. The next you know the hairs long, and then the next thing
       you know it’s dope, and the next thing you know, it’s this that, this that. The next thing you
       know it’s insanity and then the next thing you know, you killed yourself. But where did it all
       start at? Where did it all start at? When you started to walking away from Jesus! How many
       wanna just walk toward him all the time? (Amen)
        Oh God, what is it? Here’s God, JUST TRYING TO PRESS ETERNAL LIFE TO YOU!
       What…Listen to this! Let me say this! Did you know, it’s-it’s just millions, millions…I don’t
       know how to say it. But it’s all…much, much harder to go to hell then it is to heaven. It’s a lot
       harder to go to hell then it is to heaven.
        You have to walk…listen, you have to walk right over your conscience to smoke the first
       cigarette. A woman when she breaks the virtues of her body, she has to walk right over her
       conscience to do it. And the Lord say’s, “Don’t do it, don’t do it, don’t so it! Don’t do it, don’t
       do it!” And you strive right against it and go right on. Once you break right through the barrier,
       then you feel better about it. How many say, “Amen?” (Amen)
        It’s a lot harder to go to hell then it is to heaven. Here’s the Lord Jesus saying, “Come, Come,
       Come! Come on come on!” see! And the way that you’re walking, what-what-what force you’re
       closest to, the one you’re following, that’s the way when you die, that’s where you’re going.

       62-0124 - Have Not I Sent Thee?
       William Marrion Branham
       29 Now, He just…He…In order to be just, He must—He must keep His laws. And law without
       penalty is not law. See? If there’s a semaphore out here in the street, and that says “stop,” that’s
       a law for you to stop. And then if you pass on through it and the law has no penalty, then it isn’t
       a law anymore. See? It should not even be hanging there. And if God begins to wave something
       before you and tell you that you’re doing wrong, and you break that law of God warning you,
       then penalty is to be paid. You just must do it. You have to do it; you have to pay the penalty.
       “And the wages of sin is death.” So if a man transgresses God’s law and continues to do it, then
       don’t blame God if something happens to you. See? If you’re lost, you cannot say, “Well, it was
       God’s fault.” I’ve often said this, that a man has to literally fight his way to hell. He cannot go
       to hell easy. No, he has a hard time getting to hell. But he certainly fights his way right on into
       it. 30 You remember, boys, the first little corn-silk cigarette you smoked? You know what? Mama
       said…You know, you was afraid that Mama was going to smell it on your breath, so you got
       some coffee and eat it, or something, you know, to—to keep her from being able to smell. Mama
       said, “Let me smell your breath,” See? “Mama, there’s nothing wrong with me.” What’s the
       first thing? When you lied that first lie, a red light begin to flash. “Tell her the truth. Be honest,
       little boy. Mama taught you to do that.” But, see, you fight your way right on through that
       barricade and red light. See? 31 You remember the first time you trifled on your girlfriend? You
       remember the first time you—you sassed your wife, the wife sassed the husband, something like
       that? Remember the first time you heard that hymn sang at church and Something beat at your
       heart, and you just shook yourself and turned away, “I’ll do it some other time.” Them’s all red
       lights (See?), and you just walk right on over them—warnings, “Don’t go the way you’re going
       little boy, little girl. Turn back to Me. I’m your Creator.” But you walk right on through it. You
       
       53
       can’t expect nothing else. Don’t lay it onto God. If you run through that stoplight out there don’t
       say, “The city’s in blame.” No, sir. You’re the fault. That stoplight’s there to protect you, and to
       help you, and you must obey it. And then it isn’t the city’s fault; it’s your fault, ’cause you should
       have stopped when the warning come on. 32 And when you feel that little buzzer down in your
       heart warning you, then you better stop right there and take inventory. Like I was—been
       preaching along through the nights of the people drifting away from God. When you hear the
       Word, come right back. It’s truly the Word of God. There’s a little buzzer rings; you better listen
       to it. Don’t walk across that, ’cause you’ll never get any farther till you come right back here
       where you left Him. You’ll…Where you leave Christ at by failing to obey His Word, right there
       He will leave you. Or you don’t leave…He don’t leave you; you leave Him. See, you always
       leave—leave Him, because He’s got you in the path, He’s trying to lead you. But see, when you
       leave Him, then you have to come right back where you left Him at, to start again.
        Ain’t it wonderful to know we’re in service tonight. How many if you had to die, you’d like
       to die right here tonight? (Amen) That’d be the best place. Wouldn’t you rather die here than any
       place else? (Amen) So, let us, let the great force of God draw us.
        Because while we we’re yet sinners, deadly enemies to him…we were deadly enemies to
       Christ, and while we were dead enemies to Christ, Christ died for you.
       Romans 5:10-Reference quote:
       10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much
       more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
       Now, many of man has died for his friend. Many of man has died for his friend. But never was
       there a man that died for his enemies. You ever heard of one? Jesus did! We were all deadly
       enemies to Jesus and he died for each one of us. Now, should we not lay down our lives? Should
       not we take up our cross and follow after him daily?
       Luke 9:23-Reference quote:
       23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
       cross daily, and follow me.
        Let us sing a hymn. Oh my, I just love him. Something’s happened to me. I…I…I…just, I
       know that this… God helped me. God has helped me in the past few days, then… I’ve got a
       closer walk with the Lord. And now, I’m just in prayer, consecrating myself. Lord now, I’m
       praying for something and I want the congregation pray with me. How many of you say, “Lord,
       grant Brother Bob’s desire?” How many will do that? And I’m seeking and I’m gonna
       continually seek him until I hear from him. So, I’m-I’m trying to call each one of your names in
       prayer as I seek the Lord. And I’m praying for each one, I love you. I love you and I want to see
       everyone of you make it, and I’m believing you are. I believe everyone, I hope to see you there.
        So, we got a glorious future, Amen? (Amen) We got…What are we doing? We are waiting in
       love; we’re in love with the Lord Jesus, waiting for the promise of the hour to be conferred upon
       us.
        When we get Faith, Virtue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godliness, Brotherly
       kindness, he’s going to confirm his love upon us. He’ll do it!

       ¬First FAITH-SEED FROM CHRIST ETERNAL LIFE, start here to
       build a body for Christ to dwell in.
        Let’s sing number 173. And we just pray the precious Lord Jesus come. The wickedness is so
       great now. Now what, America…oh… can…how many can see how more wicked she’s getting
       every day? Great judgements of God will sit in, in just a little bit. Oh, what a judgement it’s
       gonna be. God’s speaking to me today about that. And so, I got things I want to share with you
       down the road. So…
       Congregation sings- “When We All Get To Heaven”
        While they said… play that song softly there.
        When we all get to heaven. But you know there’s a God provided way to get there. See, we
       can sing it…we could sing it and worship the Lord, but must come Gods provided way.
        I wonder while they play softly, if you wouldn’t bow your heads just a minute? Just bow your
       heads. Brother and sister dear, the days are fleeting by. The great judgments of God is ready to
       set across the land and it’ll be a terrible day. But to those who want to be pulled toward the great
       love of Christ, we’ll meet one another in the air and be in heaven together.
        We know that these angels, these supernatural lights that the Pentagon’s been seeing, is the
       angels of the Lord that’s gonna catch you away some bright morning.
        I wonder if there’s one here tonight, that if you don’t know that the Lord Jesus Christ in your
       heart by a divine revelation of him as your personal savior and you’ve never been baptized in his
       precious name? And you’d want to be counted one of them numbers to go on Gods television set,
       go on record, by raising your hands, and excepting him so he’ll a stand for you in that day. If you
       will, he’ll break your record, and put it in the sea of Gods forgetfulness. He’ll cover every sin
       under the blood and will make you as white as snow. Now, if there’s one person that would like
       to accept Christ, and be baptized in his name and be… come under the shed blood of the
       bleeding word of God for the remission of your sins, would you stand or raise your hand? God
       bless you my brother! God bless you! You’ve gone on God’s television; he sees you standing.
       He sees you standing. Now, you did your part, God will do his part. In that day he’ll say,
       “Father, he stood for me on earth, now I’m standing for him.”
        Now son, come up here and let me pray with you. Come up here let me pray, kneel right
       down here. Kneel right down here brother. Bow your head’s children.
        Dear heavenly father, this brother, we call him brother, now. He’s coming forth father, and
       he’s givin his life to thee. And Lord, may he walk a life unreproachable. May he unreservedly
       give himself to thy word. I pray father God, that you’d forgive him of every sin that he’s
       committed, put it under thy shed blood. And I pray, that you’ll make a real Christian out of him
       
       55
       father. And Lord help him yield his life thee, follow thee in water baptism. Take on the name of
       the Lord Jesus Christ. To bear the reproach for living holiness. To bear the reproach for the
       message of the hour. Father, he’s come forth here and humbled himself for thee, before all these
       people Father. Now, father I pray, that thou would bless him oh God! Save his wife Lord, save
       his children. For we ask it in Jesus name.
        It’s a great decision! And we wanna be baptized as soon as possible. Jesus said to the apostle
       Paul, “Why tarriest thou Paul, rise up and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the
       Lord.”
       Acts 22:16-Reference quote:
       16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the
       name of the Lord.
        Now, ain’t that wonderful that man’s got enough…in his right mind, he saw the word of God.
       He felt the Holy Spirit drawing him toward Heaven, stood right up! The Bible said, “No man can
       come to me, except I draw him.
       John 6:44-Reference quote:
       44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise
       him up at the last day.
       
       Gods drawing him. Now, he’ll just keep drawing him the rest of the way. As long as he’ll follow
       that Holy Spirit! Yield to that Holy spirit and let him draw him, he’ll go right on. I wanna baptize
       him as soon as we can. Now, that’s wonderful!
        Now let’s sing, “Onward to the prize before us now.”
       Congregation sings, “When We All Get To Heaven”
        Amen, Amen. Let’s sing number 29, “There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood.”
       God, I’m thankful of that fountain tonight, aren’t you?
       Congregation sings, “There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood”
       Let’s stand up to our feet now. (Congregation continues to sing)
        Just raise your hands up and praise him for that precious blood. Give him a good praise
       offering for that Blood tonight! Lord, we praise you for that Blood of God! We Praise you for
       thy omnipotent power Lord! For the precious blood of the Lamb of God, that takes away every
       sin Lord. Oh God, we praise you, Lord God! We praise you Lord, for the blood of God!
       Hallelujah! For the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, we praise him for the blood! Glory! Praise
       your wonderful name, Glory to God! God, we praise you hallelujah! Thank you for the blood
       hallelujah for the blood! Jesus Christ can make the vilest sinner whole! He can make the vilest
       sinner whole! Glory to God! Amen, the vilest sinner he can clean them up and make them whole!
       Amen! The more viler they are, the greater the glory of God! Amen, amen! Yes sir're.
        Gods able to save a hippie. Gods able to save a hippie. Amen! Some of them may go into the
       Kingdom of heaven before some others. I’d just love to be able to preach to some hippies.
        Which reminds me, I’m fishing for some fish. I had him in the house last night. And I believe
       I almost had the hook in his jaw. And I want you to pray for him. Brother Davis, is that carpenter
       
       56
       that I met. I had him last night under the Holy Spirit caught him there and he couldn’t get away.
       The ole tears weld up in his eyes and I crossed a horizontal rainbow. I took him through the
       prophet, through The Cloud, through The Face, through The Voice On The River. I took him
       Africa; I took him to England, I took him through Finland. I took him… I don’t know where all
       I didn’t take him.
        And I’m telling you, and he come over to work on my stairway. And said… “And my wife
       said tonight, said, Well, what you in such a big hurry for, it’s just a little ole stairway job?” He
       said, “But I don’t know, I’m just so excited to get there.” And he said, “Aw, you don’t know
       what this means to me, to hear such words and to know these things!” He said, “I know, I know
       there was something wrong I didn’t know what it was. He said, “I went to that ole Methodist
       church,” said, “And the Sunday school superintendent’s breath was just reeking with alcohol.”
       And said, “I didn’t want to come back no more.” And they seen him on the street and said, “You
       ought to bring them children to church Sunday or least let your wife bring them.” And he said,
       “What for! And he went (Brother Lambert a sniffing sound) he said, “madam,” he said, “I was
       there, and your breath was reeling with alcohol. What’s the use of going to church and being
       churchy. What’s that gonna get me? I can be just as good a Christian as that, as being at home
       then going there.”
        But he saw something real! Big ole tears weld up in his eyes. And you know what? It
       wouldn’t surprise me, if I don’t see him here in church. I want you all pray for him. And I’m
       gonna fish a little more when he comes back to work on my stairway. How many gonna help me,
       bring him in? (Amen) His name…If you wanna call his name in prayer, his name is, Mr. WardMr. Ward. And I find him a very unusual man. So, you’ll pray-pray for him.

       63-0623M - Standing In The Gap
       William Marrion Branham
       82 And, now, I didn’t know at the time, that they were taking pictures of that, scientists was, as
       the Angels lowered themselves from Heaven, to bring the Message. And you remember, I said the
       One on the right side of the constellation had, kind of, His chest back, and His wings. You
       remember me saying that, all of you? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] And how that I
       watched Him? He was very distinctive from the others. And I didn’t know they were taking a
       picture of It, ’cause immediately I hurried East. But going back home to Tucson, there It was all
       through the papers that had been seen almost nation-wide, or plumb into Mexico, and all the
       Western States, and I think the Courier over here. It was on the Associated Press. How many
       saw, “A mysterious cloud in the sky”? You see the hands. And now the Life magazine picked it
       up. And I have the—the article here this morning, in the Life magazine here, to show. Now here
       It is, the same time I was there. See the pyramid of the Cloud? I was standing just below this.
       And there, see the distinctive Angel on the right-hand side? See the pointed wing of It? Just
       exactly what was said. And here it’s in the view of Mexico and different places from where they
       took the picture. Now, this scientist here is trying to—to get all the information about the picture,
       that he can, about the people who has the picture. He is studying it. 83 Now, he says here that it
       would be impossible for it to be a cloud, because moisture doesn’t go over about, I’d say, about
       six or eight miles high, something like that. When we go overseas we usually fly nineteen
       thousand feet, and we’re above the storms then. But this cloud, according to this article here of
       this scientist, is twenty-six miles high. It would be miles and miles beyond moisture. And he said,
       checking the area, and now, you know I…How many remembers that I told you, “It sounded like
       the sound breaker on a plane”? Remember? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] But there was
       no plane in the district. The book says so here. They’ve checked it. There were no one, no planes
       up there. And, besides, it couldn’t…That fog behind a plane is nothing but broken-up air,
       moisture, ’cause it sucks through this unit, as a jet. As it’s pulling itself, it breaks the moisture in
       the air. It can never get rid of it, as long as there’s a jet, because it’s got to…That’s what it
       propels on, and it’s the moisture scooting out from it. 84 But here it is, miles above where there
       could be moisture, and no planes in the district. And It couldn’t be moisture up there, and hung
       up there that day. It’s thirty miles across it, twenty-six miles high. You see? Just as the same it
       was that picture there, when I told you, “The Angel of the Lord looked like a Pillar of Fire,”
       years ago, before It was ever took; God makes science recognize that It’s Truth. And here, of the
       prophecy that was given, God make science testify that It’s the Truth. Now where do we stand? I
       want to keep this, for I—I may speak to a friend of mine, that’s present this morning, to—to write
       those Seven Seals. He might want to use this for it. And so you have a copy of it, why, if you get
       one, hold it for reference. See? 85 Now he is wanting to find out, but what good would it do to go
       to tell him that? He would laugh at it. See, he would just merely laugh. So don’t cast our pearls
       like that. But we know, the Church knows, and God knows that it’s the Truth.

       Finland
       Little Boy Raised from the Dead After Brutal Car Wreck
       Miracle In Finland-Boy raised from the dead
       Compiled from Brother Branham's sermons (See WBSC),
       the book 'A Prophet Visits South Africa.' (See WBSC 'Message Publications')
       and Pearry Green (Part Audio Testimony No 40 WBSC)
       
       59
       During early 1948, William Branham was taking a train journey by night through Georgia on
       his way to Miami, Florida when a vision broke before him of a little boy laying dead beside a
       road in a countryside where there were a lot of evergreens among rocks. The boy had a strange
       looking haircut and great big brown eyes that had turned back. His foot was through his long
       stocking and his little body was just one great big mass of broken up bones. He was dead. An
       automobile was laying wrecked nearby and as Brother Branham thought, "Who is that?," the
       vision left.
       William Branham repeated the vision from the pulpit across America. He told his audiences to
       write the prophecy on the flyleaf of their Bibles to see if it happened. They were to look for a
       child, about eight years old, with dark brown hair, brown eyes, a funny haircut, and little short
       pantywaist pants. "He's going to be killed."
       In April 1950, the Branham Party flew to Finland for evangelistic services. Between services, the
       party travelled north in three cars to Kuopio which is not far from the Arctic Circle. They visited
       the Puijo Observation mountain tower from where they could see the Russian territory. While
       there, Brother Branham felt the Lord drawing near and said to his campaign managers,
       "Something is going to happen," but could not elaborate further.
       On the road down from the tower, they came upon an accident. Some twenty minutes earlier, a
       car had struck two young boys. The American made Ford V-8 had been traveling about sixty
       miles per hour and one boy had been stuck on his side and thrown up against a tree, crushing his
       head and his ribs. The other boy was rolled up under the car and thrown out behind the back
       wheel up into the air. They had him laid out with his coat over his face. A doctor had
       pronounced him to be dead and they were awaiting the arrival of his parents. A crowd of about
       500 had gathered, including businessmen and the mayor of the nearby city. Several of these men
       would later confirm the events in writing before notary public.
       As they stopped to render assistance, Brother Branham felt an unseen hand on his shoulder
       persuading him to look at the second boy. He remarked, "It seems like I have seen that boy
       somewhere. Let's look again." He turned back and noticed the foot protruding through the sock
       and recalled the boy he had seen in the vision back in America. He turned to his managers and
       told them to look on the fly leaf on their Bibles. They did so and then he exclaimed, "That's
       him!" Through his interpreter, Sister May Issacson, he told the crowd, "If that little boy isn't on
       his feet alive in five minutes, I'll leave Finland with a sign on my back, "False Prophet."
       He knelt down just the way it was shown in the vision and prayed: "Lord God, in the homeland
       You did speak of this vision and I know in Your great predestinated will, it's already finished. So
       death give back this boy's life." The boy jumped up and began running around alive and normal
       with no idea what had happened. His name was Kari Holma. When last heard of, he was a
       Highway Patrolman in Kuopio, Finland.
       It was not until later that Brother Branham was made aware of the first little boy who had not
       been killed but by then, was dying in hospital. After his parents had committed their lives to
       Christ, Brother Branham was given a vision showing this little boy also being restored to health
       and so it was fulfilled.
       When Rev. Pearry Green visited the Soviet Union in November 1977, he was led by God to meet
       one of the six Russian soldiers who had been stationed on the Finish border who had seen Kari
       Holma raised from the dead. As Brother Green moved through certain rural areas of the Soviet
       Union, he found there were people there who already knew the name of William Branham
       because they remembered that when the six soldiers had returned to their homeland, they had
       told everyone they could that they had witnessed the raising of the dead.

       Supernatural Healing of Florence Nightingale.
       Supernatural Healing of Florence Nightingale.
       Florence Nightingale was healed from cancer she was suffering at the entrance of the stomach
       which causes one to die of starvation. She weighed only about fifty pounds.
       When Brother Branham and his party landed in England, they motored to the hotel where
       Florence Nightingale was staying after Brother Branham was invited to pray for her.
       No one in the party had ever seen a human being in such a pitiful condition as the woman was in
       that room. She was so thin that the skin stuck to her bones. Their hearts were moved with
       compassion. Because of the intense pain she was suffering, Florence Nightingale could hardly
       speak as tears ran down her cheeks. Considering her state of dehydration, Brother Braham
       wondered that she could even produce tears.
       We prayed for Florence Nightingale the same evening in Houston, promising God that if he
       healed her and she returned in good health, the Branham team would accept this healing as a
       sign that they should go to South Africa.
       But seeing that Brother Branham could not meet her at home, Florence Nightingale resolved,
       despite the advice of her doctors, to take the plane on a stretcher and to meet Brother Branham
       while he was passing through London to go to Finland . Here is what happened eight weeks
       later, April 7, 1950.
       The Branham team of four other brothers: The Rev. Jack Moore, the Rev. J. Ern Baxter, Gordon
       Lindsay and Howard Branham lands at the Northolt Airport, near London. When the team got
       out of the plane, we heard the loudspeakers call: “William Branham, we ask you urgently”.
       Florence Nightingale, dying, had arrived at the airport fifteen minutes before him and those who
       accompanied her had called her urgently because they thought she was dying.
       It was one of those foggy days in April that they went to the Picadilly hotel where it was. No one
       on the team had seen such a pitiful human being. Their hearts were moved with compassion
       when they saw this woman with only skin and bones, who in great effort and with pain, tried to
       speak to them, tears running down her cheeks.
       
       61
       All, including a minister of the Anglican church and his nurses, knelt. As they began to pray, a
       dove descended and peered on the edge of the window, and looking inside, it cooed. When
       Brother Branham had finished praying and said “Amen,” the dove flew away.
       The minister asked: Have you seen this dove? He had not finished his question as the Spirit of
       the Lords descended on Brother Branham and he said these words: SO SAID THE LORD, you
       are going to live sister.
       At first it was thought that the dove was simply a tame bird, but we later learned that it was the
       first time that such a thing had happened.
       Eight months after this incident in England, Brother Branham received a second photo from
       Florence Nightingale. This time she was in good health and weighed one hundred and fifty-five
       pounds. It was then that he received the conviction that he also had to go to South Africa.

       Why Did William Branham Go To South Africa?
       Daily there comes to the home of William Branham countless numbers of prayer requests. Many
       of these are accompanied by airplane tickets requesting him to come to pray for the sick. It was
       one of these requests that caused Bro. Branham to make it a definite matter of prayer pertaining
       to his trip to South Africa. He had considered South Africa before, but The Lord had always
       directed him to go elsewhere. Brother Branham had thought of going to Australia and Japan, but
       in April of 1950 The Lord definitely led His Prophet to South Africa.
       During the month of January, 1950, Brother Branham and Brother F.F. Bosworth were
       conducting meetings in Houston, Texas. On the same evening that the photograph was taken of
       Brother Branham, which registered the halo above his head, Brother Bosworth showed Brother
       Branham a lady’s picture. It had accompanied a letter and airplane ticket from Florence
       Nightingale of Durban, South Africa, a distant relative of the Florence Nightingale who founded
       the Red Cross. She was a mere skeleton and reminded them of Georgia Carter, a young lady
       from Milltown, Indiana, who was in a similar condition before she received her healing. For
       nearly nine years she had been on her back with tuberculosis and weighed hardly forty pounds at
       the time Brother Branham prayed for her.
       This Florence nightingale of Durban suffered from cancer at the entrance of the stomach which
       causes one to die of starvation. She weighed only about fifty pounds. She had been fed through
       the veins on glucose until that was no longer possible. Hearing of Brother Branham, she cried
       for him to come and pray for her. Thus she wrote for him to come, sending along her picture and
       plane ticket. The picture showed what the cancer was doing to the woman – She was lke a
       skeleton with flesh stretched over the bone. It would take nothing less of a miracle to bring her
       back to health.
       It would be several weeks before they would personally meet Miss. Nightingale, but that night in
       Houston they prayed for her, promising God that if He would heal her and make her completely
       well, they would take it as a “Sign” from God that they should go to South Africa.
       Eight weeks later the Branham party landed in England on their way to Finland. In reponse to a
       cable from the King of England, the Branham party stopped in England for Brother Branham to
       go and pray for the King. As they were making their way through the airport William Branham’s
       
       62
       name was called over the loud speaker. Florence Nightingale had arrived at the airport just
       fifteen minutes before and those with her had put out this call for Brother Branham to come
       quickly because they thought she was dying. The place was so crowded that they were informed
       to get in touch with him at the Picadilly Hotel. This was done and arrangements were made for
       him to come to her hotel.
       It was one of those foggy days in April when they motored to the hotel where she was staying. No
       one in the party had ever seen a human being in such a pitiful condition as the woman in that
       room. She was so thin that the skin stuck to her bones. Their hearts were moved with
       compassion. Florence Nightingale could hardly speak as tears ran down her cheeks for she was
       suffering with such pain.
       They all, including a minister of the Church of England as well as her nurses, knelt and began to
       pray for her. As they started to pray a dove came and sat on the window sill, looking inside as it
       started to coo. After prayer, when Brother Branham said, “Amen,” the dove flew away. The
       minister started to speak saying, “Did you see that dove?” Before he finished the question the
       ‘Spirit of the Lord’ moved upon Brother Branham to speak these words – “Thus saith the Lord,
       you will live, sister.”
       Eight months after Brother Branham had prayed for Florence Nightingale in England he
       received another picture from her. At this time she was a perfect picture of health and weighed
       155 pounds. He had made his vow to God and was now convinced that he had to go to South
       Africa. God had called him to South Africa and now his desire was that he might be a blessing to
       the people he had been called to minister unto.
       While we were still in Johannesburg, and weeks before we came to Durban, Brother Branham
       told us that our greatest meetings would be in Durban. He always spoke of Durban with the
       anticipation of great things being done for God. Later on in this page you will find a report of
       the meetings which were held there, the greatest meetings which were ever held in South Africa.
       We did not have the opportunity to meet Florence Nightingale while we were in South Africa
       because we understand she was then living in England.

        And let’s pray, I think that every person in this church here ought to pray. You know, the
       supreme purpose of us here in Connecticut? To win souls to Christ. To win souls to Christ. So,
       you pray, “Lord, lead me to souls. Help me find a soul, and to witness to them about Christ, you
       see. Of course, we just can’t meet them and try to impress them to over to the assembly, but try
       to find those that Gods called.
        Now, here’s a young back here, young man back here tonight. Like this Brother Cory’s…I
       think that’s the same young man that help skin some squirrels for me, I believe! Isn’t that, right?
       He showed me how to skin a coon too. That’s right, I thought that was him! Now what that was
       see, the Lord led him. And Brother Cory witnessed, I imagined Brother Cory witnessed to him
       telling him about Christ.
        Now see, don’t give up, don’t give up! How many would like to see, would like to see our
       assembly just grow and God saves souls? Sure! See! But we just can’t hug it all up to us you
       know. Just let the Lord lead us, let the Lord lead us let the Lord lead and guide us, bring a soul in
       now.
        I tell ya, another soul I’d love, now I’ve fished for him, Brother George fished for him a
       couple of times for him. And that is the man that owns this property. When he comes and he has
       to see me, and he hears me talk about the Lord, he can’t leave. He’ll listen for hours and just
       hang onto every word. And the last time I seen him…of course he has a lot of money. And I said,
       “When you get interested in a doctor for your soul,” I said, “come see me. I’ll try to help your
       soul!” He said, “Mr. Lambert, when I get interested, I’ll come!” And so, let us pray God will
       make Mr. Velnellic interested.
        And be sure and pray that God will save Mr. Wards soul. Because his eyes were swealing up
       with tears last night. He said, “Isn’t that wonderful, oh my!” And he was just thrilled! And my, I
       had him just like he thought he was right in Finland.
       I just love to tell them beautiful stories of the prophet. How many love the precious prophet of
       God? (Amen) Remember, it’s his message, his message is forerunning Christ!

       123. Brother Branham, we know that you are a messenger sent from God to this church age. The
       very same signs that followed Jesus we see following you, and we are…understand why some
       who know you best think you are Messiah. Would you explain the difference in your relationship
       to God and that of Christ’s?
       383 Well, I know, brethren, that is true. See, but let’s wait, I got something wrote down on that
       here, just for a minute. See, many times it’s misunderstood. See? But, now, in the person
       sometime…And I want some of you to turn with me to Luke, the 3rd chapter and the 15th verse.
       While you’re doing that, I might be saying to you…When you get it, that it’s Luke 3,
       it’s…might…it’s in…Let me just…I ain’t going to shut the door, ’cause there’s nobody there.
       Let—let me just get this to you, brethren. You have heard it, it’s all around. But let’s let me tell
       you, see, it has to come that way. It’s got to come that way. If it wasn’t that way I would repent of
       my message. 384 Listen, brethren, I adjure you before Christ that you—you—you hold this
       part of your peace, but if you were spiritual you would understand. See? Don’t you know what
       the very first thing He said down there on the river? Don’t you remember what He said? “AS
       
       64
       JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS SENT FORTH TO FORERUN THE FIRST COMING OF
       CHRIST, YOUR MESSAGE…” IT’S THE MESSAGE THAT WILL FORERUN THE
       SECOND COMING OF CHRIST. THAT’S WHAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID. 385
       Now, now notice. Now, “As John the Baptist…” Now, all of you have heard that. You’ve read it
       in books, and heard people that standing there hearing It, and everything else, when that Angel
       Itself spoke THAT MESSAGE, “AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS SENT FORTH TO
       FORERUN THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST, YOU ARE SENT WITH THIS MESSAGE,
       WILL FORERUN THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.” NOW, “THE MESSAGE.”

       that He would send the forerunner before us, and I believe that to be John.” 105 Now we
       know, when you see a sign, a true Bible sign, there is A TRUE BIBLE VOICE BEHIND IT. If
       there is no voice follows the sign, just the same old theological voice, forget it; it never come
       
       65
       from God. There is, always. Told Moses, “IF THEY WON’T BELIEVE THE FIRST SIGN,
       THEY’LL BELIEVE THE VOICE OF THE SECOND SIGN.” THERE HAS GOT TO BE A
       VOICE WITH THE SIGN. ABSOLUTELY! And if it’s the same old theological voice, forget it.
       You already had that. It’s something; GOD IS TRYING TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF
       THE PEOPLE, BY A SIGN, AND THEN GIVE THEM THE VOICE, WHAT’S BEHIND

       143 Now still they won’t believe it. Jesus promised that, “As it was in the days of Noah, and as it
       was in the days of Lot, it would be in the last day.” We’ve got it. It’s here. It’s already
       vindicated, just how many Scriptures! In the Sodom age, what happened to Abraham, would
       return back again to Abraham’s royal Seed, which is in Christ; CHRIST RETURNING IN
       THE FORM OF THE WORD, working in human beings, and showing the signs that He
       promised it would sign, it would do. He promised that He would do it. God promised it. And God
       will keep His promise. 144 And now, a few years ago, I told you that He spoke to me and said,
       “THERE WOULD BE THREE STAGES OF THIS MINISTRY. And one of them would be by
       taking the people by the hand, and would know what their troubles was.” How many remembers
       that? Sure. Did not I tell you, “If I’d be sincere,” that He told me, “it would come to pass that I
       would know even the secret that was in their heart”? Did I tell you that? How many remembers
       that? Did it happen? It never happened the next day, it was years later, but it happened. 145
       AND HE SPOKE DOWN ON THE RIVER, HE SAID, “AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS
       SENT FORTH TO PROCLAIM THE COMING OF CHRIST, AT THE END OF HIS
       MINISTRY, JESUS CAME. AND AS JOHN WAS SENT, SO WILL YOUR MINISTRY
       FORERUN THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.” And there’s been a universal revival
       amongst the people of God, throughout the world, in the last fifteen years; the longest revival.
       Any historian knows that no revival lasts over three years. And this is fifteen years. And look at
       the church today, it’s cooled off. We’re waiting for His Coming. He is a vindicating Himself,
       showing. 146 Now, all these things has happened. He promised in there, that, “You’d know the
       secret of the heart.” 147 NOW THE THIRD STAGE IS JUST BREAKING IN IN THE
       MINISTRY NOW. I won’t take time to go in there, ’cause I think I oughtn’t. But many of you
       here know about it, see, of what’s taken place.

       LIKE’S COMING INTO THE CHURCH NOW. I KNOW IT FOR A FACT. “Say unto this
       mountain be moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that what you’ve said shall come to
       pass, you can have what you have said”: THE PLACING OF THE CHURCH IN POSITION,
       WHERE THE FULNESS OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST COMES INTO THE
       CHURCH. THEN CRITICS’ MOUTHS WILL BE SHUT. IT’LL BE A SHORT TIME.

       WANT TO. Glory! He’ll be slayed by the Word that proceeds from His mouth, is sharper than
       a two-edged sword. THEY COULD CALL FOR A HUNDRED BILLION TONS OF FLIES
       IF THEY WANTED TO. Amen. WHATEVER THEY SAY, IS GOING TO HAPPEN,

       Opening prayer: By Robert Lambert;
        Gracious heavenly father we’re very thankful to be here this morning to be living in this latter
       day. We’re so thankful father God that thy hast revealed thy word to our hearts. Thou hast not
       left us without a hope, that thou hast revealed unto us the promise for this hour, and with
       steadfastness and assurance and confidence in our hearts we press that battle. We strive and
       struggle to enter into the great token of God for this day. Heavenly father we want to be a part of
       that great body the Bride of Christ. We pray that you’ll help us as we come before thee this
       morning, under the shed blood of the Lord Jesus in humbleness of our heart. Praying God that
       you would have mercy upon thy people and send thy great Kingdom Father, upon this earth that
       it may subdue the enemy. Heavenly father we pray that you’d help us this morning to make the
       vision plain. May it be wrote upon the hearts of thy children and Lord may there be a
       consecration and dedication of our lives to thy living word. Oh, Christ Jesus of Nazareth, we
       pray thy blessing upon these people. And father I pray this morning, for there are sick and
       afflicted here among us. And Lord we’re livin in an hour when there’s so much sickness and so
       much virus’s and flu’s and germ’s Lord. I pray God that while this people sit here this morning
       that the great presence of the livin Christ, may pass through this building and may when they
       leave here may they find that their sicknesses are gone. God if we could only realize who we are,
       if we could only see our names in the book. If we could only realize that the one that we feel in
       our midst, how can we be sick Lord? Lord let us rise above these things in faith and be made
       whole. Now father bless thy unworthy servant and bless this word in Jesus name Amen.
        You may be seated. I know I waste about twenty or thirty minutes just talking, but I won’t do
       that this morning, I won’t say anything, I’ll just have you to open your Bibles to Ezekiel the first
       chapter. I believe I have something from the Lord.
        I was sitting in my room yesterday afternoon and I said, “Lord I wish you would give me
       something special for me.” Maybe I won’t preach it, but let me see something different. And I
       just sat there just a few minutes meditating and reached down and got my Bible and it fell open
       to Ezekiel and I just looked down and seen something there and kept reading and the more I read
       the better it got. So, I thought we’ll just bring that to Gods people this morning.
        I’m very happy to see each one of you with us this morning. I pray that the Lord Jesus will
       bless you. I see a couple of young girls faces I haven’t seen here before. We’re very thankful to
       have each and every one of you with us.
        We don’t come here to be seen of one another but we come here before the judgement seat of
       Christ the word revealed. That if we have anything wrong with our lives, we want to make sure
       that we get it out today. Because this is the judgement seat.

       336 But, one of these days, if we never meet again on this earth, we’re going to meet yonder at
       the—at the JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST. And you’ll find out, that, IN THAT ROOM,
       THE REVELATION COMING FROM GOD, just like all the rest of them has, that
       Them…One of the mystery of that Seal, the reason It wasn’t revealed, It was Seven Thunders
       that uttered Their voices. And there It is, perfectly. Because, nothing knows anything about It.
       It wasn’t even written. So, we’re at the end time. We are here. I thank God for His Word.
       
        And often years ago when I first started preaching, I used to say a lot about… I found in this
       hour many people want to live a life that’s unpleasing to Christ and then die and resurrect
       perfected in an angelic form. We can’t do that.
        Just exactly the way you act today if the rapture would take place, when you got in heaven
       that’s exactly how you’d act up there. So, we know that this is the day for each one of us to
       come before the judgement seat of Christ purging our souls and our hearts. Making sure that
       our lives are lined up with the word of God. That’s why I say, this is a judgement seat, because
       if you except your judgement here and judge yourself then he won’t judge you in that day.
       How many want to judge yourself, judge yourself so you won’t be judged in that day.
        Now we’re very thankful to have each one of you with us.
        Now let’s read now this morning from Ezekiel. I can’t read that whole chapter but it’s
       needful. I need to read the second chapter and part of the third, all three chapters. But when you
       go home, the scriptures that I don’t read then you read them. See, but don’t you try to figure out
       the rest of the scriptures you see. You just… a lot of people hear a minister type and then they try
       to type things. You can’t do it you see! You can only type as the Lord leads you to do it, see.
       And then you won’t get into trouble, you just read it and he’ll tell you what he wants you to
       know out of it.
        Now I want to read from Ezekiel 1:4 (1:3) Let’s start reading in verse three to catch the
       prophet here.
       Ezekiel 1:3-10-Scripture Reading;
       3 The word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the
       Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.
       4 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire
       infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of
       amber, out of the midst of the fire.
       5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their
       appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
       6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
       7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and
       they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
       8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their
       faces and their wings.
       
       3
       9 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one
       straight forward.
       10 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on
       the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of
       an eagle.
        Now skip down here to verse 27. Yes, verse 27.
       Ezekiel 1:27-28-Scripture Reading;
       27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the
       appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I
       saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
        Verse 28.
       Ezekiel 1:28-Scripture Reading;
       28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of
       the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And
       when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
        Let’s bow our heads. Father bless this word and may you inspire me with the holy spirit that
       gave me this message. God give me words in simplicity that I may paint the vision and make it
       plain to the people on this prophesy this morning. In Jesus name, amen.
        I believe that everything that every vision that comes from the Lord, if it’s a true vision fits
       into the word of the Bible. Any vision that won’t fit into the word of God, it’s not worth
       spending time to look at. But the vision must come from the Bible. And we know that in this end
       time, that this is the hour when God is revealing the Bible.
        And we notice here that all these things that were written unto Moses and to all the prophets
       like Noah, were…has something to do with the very hour that we’re living in. This is the climax
       and the fulfillment of all that the prophets spoke of.
        Remember that Jesus Christ was the fulfillment of the prophesy of the prophets. All the
       revelation and the words and the reports… as I preached a few Sundays ago was wound up in the
       Lord Jesus Christ. He became the fulfillment of all that the prophets spoke of. Everything that
       the prophets ever spoke of was fulfilled in the one person the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, I believe
       that it’s turning from the prophesy of the prophet today into the fulfillment of the prophesy. It’s
       turning from the prophet to the prophesy.

       William Marrion Branham
       But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
       God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets. 309 All those things,
       like, oh, Rome being the—the whore, and all the Protestant churches, denominations
       denominating after her, has become her harlots. See? All those mysteries, that the prophets
       spoke of, will be revealed right here in this last hour. 310 And when this seventh angel rises in
       
       4
       the Laodicean age and begins to sound forth the true Trumpet, because It’ll be contrary, they
       won’t believe It. They sure won’t believe It. But, it’ll be an inspired prophet, because there’s
       no way to figure It out. 311 Men try to figure out the trinity, and go gray-headed and go crazy.
       No one can understand it. They still believe Eve eat an apple, and all those things. Because, it’s
       tradition that men has held onto, just like Jesus found the church. 312 BUT IT’LL HAVE TO
       BE A DIVINE-LED PROPHET, FOR THE WORD OF GOD TO COME TO HIM, WITH
       THE TRUE INTERPRETATION OF THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. So, then,
       it—it’s got to be that way. God help us! 313 Now, “When he is sounding forth,” now, that’s
       THUS SAITH THE LORD. We have that clear. When he sounds forth his Message, declares
       war; like Paul did on the Orthodox, like the rest of them did, like Luther, Wesley, against the
       organization. When he declares war, and tells them, “They are lying, and it’s not the Truth! And
       they’re deceiving men!” When he sounds forth That, you can’t fail. It won’t fail, because he’ll
       be vindicated by the Word of God. You’ll know exactly what It is. And when he does, he
       sounds forth, to call from Babylon, “Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of
       her sins.” God, send him! Don’t miss it. 314 Now, “When he begins to sound, the mystery will
       be finished.” Now, note, THEN IT’S TIME FOR THE SEVEN SEAL VOICES, OF
       REVELATION 10, TO BE REVEALED. Do you understand? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—
       Ed.] When all the mysteries of the Book has completed! And the Bible said, here, that he
       would finish the mysteries.

       16 And we’re just trying to hit the highlights. And then a little later, why, we’ll have it in book
       form so you can read it and—and it’ll be a little—little more added to it, because at night…You
       notice, the last couple nights, I’VE TRYING, BEEN, SAVE THE VOICE, YOU SEE,
       BECAUSE THAT BIG CLIMAX, THAT’S WHAT I WANT TO SEE; THERE WHERE THE
       REVELATION OF CHRIST BE MADE IN THIS AGE, SEE, OF WHAT IT IS.
        So, we know here that I believe that, every message that I ever preached, I think for four
       years I have proved the Token. I have proved the token from Genesis clear through to
       Revelation. Hundreds of times, I’ve never seen it fail, that it proves itself out. All types all
       shadows all scriptures are running into one thing the true baptism of the holy Ghost Jesus Christ
       God’s gift.

       9 Now you people in the tapes in there, I would that—that…I think now I… This morning, the
       message this morning was, to me, the highlights Message of my entire ministry; this morning,
       see, a highlight Message of my entire ministry. Someday I’ll tell you how it come about. And I
       
       5
       know that everything has worked for months and months and months, up to that one Message,
       moving up to come to that place. That was the capping-off time of it, you see. And it’s a… 10
       Now I’m sure, or hope, that you got what the Token meant. See? The Token is the sign that
       the Blood has been applied. That, the price that’s been asked, required of God, Jesus paid that
       price by shedding His Own Blood. He did that. Then, from His life came the Holy Spirit. And
       when the Blood is applied to you, the Holy Spirit is a Token that your price is paid; God has
       received you, and that’s the Token. Remember, that is the Token. Now, there is many people
       who doesn’t, they—they don’t know what that Token is, see. And you have to make it like that
       nobody knows it, see, so that all of them will get it.
        Now, I believe that there is a great revelation here in Ezekiel. Now you know that God
       never… in this precious book he never put all those things in there, just all them symbols and
       everything just to lay in there. There is a revelation in Ezekiel to us. There’s something in
       Ezekiel that we need to know, he never just wrote these things down. I never did understand
       them, but I understand them this morning. That they’re there for a reason, there’re there for our
       help and our admonition, to make the vision plain to the people so that you might understand
       what Jesus Christ is doing in this hour.
        Now the first thing that I want to call to note to your mind to is, Ezekiel verse four. That the
       word of the Lord came unto this prophet Ezekiel. Now, Ezekiel was in the Bible called the Son
       of Man. Now why wasn’t Isaiah called the Son of Man? Why wasn’t Jeremiah called the Son of
       Man? God chose to bring out in Ezekiel the Son of Man.
       Ezekiel 1:3-Scripture Reading;
       3 The word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the
       Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.

       71 Now, why wasn’t He recognized as Son of man? The Son of man was the spiritual
       revelation, a prophet. Son of man means “prophet.” 72 Now if you’ll turn over in your Bibles to
       Ezekiel, the 2nd chapter and the 1st verse, you’ll find out that Ezekiel was the prophet, the Word
       of God for that day. And Jehovah Himself called him the son of man. Jehovah called him a
       man, the son of man, the same as Jesus revealed Himself as Son of man. What was it? The
       promised Word of that hour being made manifest, same God! God of Ezekiel’s time, God of
       Jesus’ time, Son of man! He was not at that time… 73 HE WAS THE SON OF MAN
       BECAUSE HE HAD COME TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO ISRAEL AS A PROPHET, AND
       THEY REJECTED IT. AND THAT WAS THE PROPHECY THAT THEY SHOULD
       RECEIVE HIM IN, IN THE NAME OF THE SON OF MAN, A PROPHET, BECAUSE IT
       WAS ACCORDING TO THE WORD. Deuteronomy 18:15, “The Lord your God shall raise up
       a Prophet likened unto me.” And when He come, He identified Himself in His ministry as a
       man, not a Son of God, Son of man! God is a Spirit. And He revealed Himself as Son of man,
       what He claimed to be. And they was blinded and couldn’t see it. 74 BUT NOW UNTO THE
       GENTILES HE REVEALS HISSELF, AND NOW THE SON OF GOD which is the Holy
       
       6
       Ghost. Now, Jesus said, “As it was in the days of Sodom!” 75 I want this blind prosecutor to see
       this. He’s a blind interpreter of the Word, always. He takes his organizational ideas of It, and
       knows no more about It than nothing. He does it to deceive, because he is a deceiver at the
       beginning. 76 Jesus said, “As it was in the days of Sodom, when the Son of man is being
       revealed!” In the days of Sodom was the Son (that was God) revealed in human flesh, which
       was one time called Melchisedec, the Father. Melchisedec at that time had no father and no
       mother, and no beginning of days or no ending of life; ever Who He was, He remains the
       same. Jesus had father and mother; but this Man had neither father nor mother. And He
       appeared to Abraham in the form of a Son of man, Elohim, Jehovah. The church now has
       served the term through the church age, in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But JESUS SAID
       HERE, TO MAKE MALACHI 4 AND THE REST OF THESE SCRIPTURES REAL TO
       YOU, SEE, THAT “IN THE LAST DAYS, JUST BEFORE THE COMING, THE WORLD
       SETTING WILL BE LIKE THE SODOM, AND THE SON OF MAN WILL REVEAL
       HISSELF AS THE SON OF MAN LIKE HE DID IN THE DAYS OF SODOM.”

       58 And that’s God. HE CHANGED HIMSELF FROM—FROM A PILLAR OF FIRE, TO
       BECOME A MAN. Then changed Hisself from that, back in the Spirit again, THAT HE
       MIGHT DWELL IN MAN. GOD ACTING IN MAN WHAT HE REALLY WAS. JESUS
       CHRIST, WAS GOD ACTING IN MAN, IN A MAN. IN A MAN, THAT’S WHAT HE WAS.
       He had changed from the Pillar of Fire, and then had come in; which was a veil in the
       wilderness, THAT HID GOD FROM ISRAEL. Moses seen the shape of His body, but really
       He was hid all the time behind this Pillar of Fire, which was the Logos that went from God. 59
       Now we find here, now since Pentecost, GOD IS NOT ACTING IN MAN, OR ACT…NOW HE
       IS ACTING THROUGH MAN. SEE? HE WAS ACTING IN A MAN THEN, JESUS. NOW
       HE IS ACTING THROUGH MAN THAT HE HAS CHOSEN FOR THIS PURPOSE. GOD,
       IN THE FORM OF MAN, HE CHANGED HIMSELF FROM THE FORM OF—OF A…OF
       GOD, TO A FORM OF MAN. 60 He came in three names, three son’s names. He came in the
       Son…name of the Son of—of man, the Son of David, and the Son of God; three son’s names.
       61 Now, He came first in the Son of Da-…Son of man, because He was a Prophet. Now,
       Jehovah Himself called Ezekiel and the prophets, “Son of man, what seest thou?” JESUS
       NEVER REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS SON OF GOD; HE REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS
       SON OF MAN, BECAUSE THE—THE SCRIPTURES CANNOT BE BROKEN.
        Notice in Luke seventeen that the Son of man was to be revealed again in the last day. And
       God only came in three names, and that was, the Son of David, the Son of God, and the Son of
       Man. Now we’re out of the church ages, where he revealed himself as the Son of God. That’s
       why they were Trinity. That’s why that your daddy was baptized father son and holy ghost.
       That’s why your pastor preached it, that’s why all your relatives, we’re all praying in father son
       and holy ghost. That’s why they believed in three God’s is because God never revealed it to
       them that he was one God. So, they’re not lost their saved. But the revelation just wasn’t
       revealed.

       50 THEN WHEN HE DIED, ROSE, ASCENDED, AND SENT BACK THE HOLY SPIRIT,
       THAT WAS THE SON OF GOD. GOD IS A SPIRIT, AND THROUGH THE CHURCH AGE
       IT’S BEEN SON OF GOD.
        But know after the church ages are over, he has promised that he would be revealing himself
       as the Son of Man. And that is God, the simplicity of God. God in humility and simplicity hiding
       in a human being. That in the end-time he would hide himself from the wise and the prudent.
       And he would find some little fella and get in him and hide there. And then he would be revealed
       in his own word. So, the only way that you could see the Son of Man the Lord Jesus Christ is see
       him as he is revealed in his word by a revelation. Then preached from the body that he was hid
       in, that’s the Son of Man. God hidden and revealed in a man, see in his body. That’s the whole
       Bride of Jesus Christ, will be the Son of man revealed because that’s the body.
       Matthew 11:25-Reference quote:
       25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
       because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto

       65-0219 - This Day This Scripture Is Fulfilled
       William Marrion Branham
       183 Jesus said, in Saint Luke the 17th chapter, the 30th verse. Jesus Christ, the Word Himself!
       Do you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] JESUS CHRIST, THE WORD
       HIMSELF, MADE FLESH, SPOKE AND SAID WHAT THE WORD WOULD BE IN THE
       END TIME, WHAT WILL BE THE SIGN OF THE END OF THE WORLD. He told them
       nation would rise against nation, but He said, “As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in
       the day when the Son of man is being revealed.” 184 Now, when Jesus came to the earth, He
       came in the name of three Sons. Son of man, which is a prophet; Son of God; and Son of
       David. 185 Now, He lived here on earth. He never did say He was the Son of God. He said,
       “I’m the Son of man.” Jehovah Himself called Ezekiel and the prophets, “Son of man.”
       Because, He had to come to fulfill Scripture as a prophet. Moses said, “The Lord your God shall
       raise up a Prophet likened unto me.” That’s the reason He could not be the Son of God there,
       because He was the Son of man. He…“The Word came to the prophets.” And He was the Word
       in Its fullness. Son of man, the—the major prophet…Not the major prophet, BUT THE GODPROPHET, “THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY WAS IN HIM.”
       THEREFORE, HE WAS THE SON OF MAN. 186 Now, for two thousand years, He’s been
       known to us as Son of God, Spirit. 187 And in the Millennium, He’ll be Son of David, upon the
       Throne. We all know that, who believe the Scriptures. 188 Now, Jesus said, just at the end of this
       
       8
       church age that we’re living in, that, “The Son of man would be revealed again in the same
       manner it was, as it was at Sodom.”
        Now many people misunderstand and think that our prophet messenger was the Son of Man.
       No, God was hid in that man and he was revealing the Son of man. The Son of man is the body,
       see. God hidden in the body. Now how many is in the body, that’s how many he’s hidden in.
        Now notice…Put on your spiritual bonnets now! I’ll have to go on with this cause it’s deep,
       you know! I pray that if you don’t understand it this morning why then you keep listening to the
       tapes then by and by, you’ll understand.
        Now notice here, that the first thing that I want you to see, that a whirlwind of the Lord came
       out of the north. Now this was the first thing that he saw was God moving by in a whirl wind.
       And a whirlwind denotes Judgement. Notice here that Judgement whirlwind was coming forth
       from the Lord.

       64-0411 - Spiritual Amnesia
       William Marrion Branham
       69 Israel had got in that same shape now. They didn’t want God’s prophets no more. They
       didn’t need them. And if one would come, and bring them the Word, and try to bring them
       back to the Word, they would reject It. They always do it, in that manner of corruption. 70
       When the world and the church joins itself together, then they don’t want nothing spiritual.
       They don’t want THUS SAITH THE LORD. They want what they want. They want the world,
       and to say they’re a Christian; and live in the world, and live with the world, and live like the
       world, and still maintain their confession of being a Christian. You know, the thing of it is, it’s
       spiritual amnesia. That’s exactly what it is. They don’t know who they are. They’ve forgotten
       that what they’re supposed to do. 71 If one would come today, like that, it would be rejected just
       the same. They had a bad case of it, and so have they today. They could not identify themselves
       with the supernatural things, anymore, because they didn’t want it. The Word, the Gospel,
       they didn’t want It. Sin disease had afflicted them, and they loved that. 72 Sin is pleasant to
       the unconverted heart. It looks good to the unconverted mind, but it’s the way of death.
       THERE IS NOTHING LEFT BUT DEATH. “THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH,” AND YOU
       MUST REAP THEM WAGES. YOU’VE SOWED TO THE WINDS, AND NOW REAPING
       THE WHIRLWIND. 73 THE SPIRITUAL SIGNS AND THE PREACHING OF AN
       ORDAINED MESSENGER FROM GOD, NEVER STIRRED THEM ANYMORE. The
       women could laugh right in their face, and say, “I don’t have to go hear such a stuff as that.” IF
       THAT HASN’T REPEATED AGAIN! What is it? Spiritual amnesia, exactly what it is. They
       have forgotten that God and His Word is the same, and He cannot change It. 74 If a prophet
       rose on the scene in them days and give a spiritual sign, a spiritual voice, and gave the voice of
       God behind it, they’d only laugh at It and make fun of It. 75 You know the old saying, “Fools
       will walk with hobnailed shoes where Angels fear to trod.” That’s what this spiritual amnesia
       does. It makes people get to a spot till where they have no feeling on the inside of them. They
       don’t want nothing that’s spiritual. 76 Take a real spiritual meeting, where the Holy Spirit is
       healing the sick and discerning the thoughts that’s in the heart, and put it in among all the
       churches, just a great rally out here in this stadium, and look what would happen. In a few
       
       9
       minutes, everybody would be getting up and walking out. They have nothing to do with it. They
       don’t want nothing to do with it. They’ll listen to some intellectual talk. 77 But when it comes to
       the Power of Jesus Christ, and His resurrection, and the Holy Ghost, they want nothing to do
       with It, because it condemns them. It sets them afire with the thing that they ought to know.
       No chastisement, of course, is pleasant for the season. But, it, if you’ll yield to it, it—it brings
       the fruits of repentance. So we find out, when this spiritual amnesia get a hold of the people,
       then they are—they are in a bad condition. Now we find the same now. Now I want to… 78
       You must be identified. Somewhere, you must show. Your life shows, tonight, where you are
       identified. You are identified either in Christ or out of Christ. You are not half way. There is no
       such a thing as a drunk sober man. There is no black white bird. You’re either saved or you are
       not saved. You are a saint or a sinner, one or the other, AND YOUR SPIRITUAL ATTITUDE
       TOWARDS GOD’S WORD IDENTIFIES YOU EXACTLY WHERE YOU’RE STANDING.
       Right! 79 God’s Word, vindicated, proved that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just the same as
       it ever was on the Day of Pentecost or any other time. And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
       today, and forever. And your attitude towards That identifies whether you have spiritual
       amnesia, or not. That’s right. No matter whether if you’re a deacon, or even if you’re a
       preacher, it doesn’t make…Yeah, they get it, too. So we find out, it’s contagious and hits the
       whole thing. Now we notice.

       157 Stand there and see a whirlwind come out of the sky. It blowed a mountain half in two,
       standing there where we was at; cut the top of trees off and things like that. And a blast of Word
       come out and shook there three times, said, “Watch it go to the West Coast.” Went right over

       And God in all ages, when He made… He's never made a way of escape that the people in full
       would take it. There's always been those who pulled away. But I want you to notice one great
       thing, that always God sends mercy, and judgment follows mercy. And when you… And if you
       do not accept mercy, then you must receive judgment. You believe that? 26 Now, if you notice,
       just before the first World War they received the baptism of the Holy Spirit in this country and
       other countries. See? Now, when we seen the greatest thing, the greatest revival, the greatest
       ministries that's ever been known since the days of Jesus Christ, has crossed this nation. Tell me
       when, where, whereabouts did we ever, ever read in a book or hear or even know of ministry
       like we have today. Now, what's going to follow it? Judgment, to reject it. Look at the ministry
       
       10
       of our Lord. Because they rejected it, we had in the service last night, by rejecting it, what
       happened? Judgment followed. Certainly, always. Because they… Look, the Holy Spirit fell in
       Russia about a hundred years ago. Did you know that? Certainly it did. They rejected it. What
       did they get? It fell in Germany before it fell here. What did they get? They wouldn't accept the
       cross, so they got a double-cross, a swastika. See? And now, because that we turned down as a
       nation… And I truly believe we made our fatal mistake in '56. And when we… Now,
       remember, I've got it on record (See?), and you just remember; she'll never come back again;
       she's finished. That's right. We're gleaning. But it'll never come back again. There'll never be
       a great revival sweep this nation before judgment. She's coming to judgment; it's on its road
       there now. Most any time it will arrive. I do myself believe, that before this great judgment
       strikes the nation, that the second coming of Jesus will take His church from the earth. I
       believe it. Now, we know that the world cannot stand an atomic blast. God has made a way for
       us to escape it. But if we refuse to escape it, then He's going to ask, why didn't we take it? 27
       Now, He's done everything that He promised in the Bible. Now, many peoples… I'm not differing
       with the scholars. No, sir. But I only work by revelation; the revelation has to be the Word. If it
       isn't according to the Word, then it's a wrong revelation. Many are looking for great things to
       happen, and they're applying that over into Israel and not in the church. Take the first three
       chapters of Revelations and you got the church right there. Then John was caught up from the
       church age. Now, so our day is just about finished, the church.
       
        And then Ezekiel the man of God began to see the glory of God. And he saw these four beast
       creatures which we know was the powers of God that he sent to the seven-church ages.
        And notice, that the last power that Ezekiel saw was the face of an Eagle. Now notice there,
       that it had to say Eagle because that is the last Bride age, that’s the last day. The last anointing
       that God was to send to the church was a face of an eagle, the power of an eagle, which is a
       prophet age.

       deceive the very genes, predestinated, the Elected Ones, if it was possible”? Almost like the real
       thing, see. So, in the last days. Now, you see, it’s wheat time now. It’s getting harvest time. This
       is not Luther’s age, this is not Pentecost age, this is the Bride age. 141 As Moses called a nation
       out of a nation, Christ today is calling a Church out of a church, you see; the same thing in
       type, taking them to the glorious Eternal Promised Land.
        We’ve had one prophet come on the scene a major prophet, Mal 4:5 and no doubt in the days
       to come that we’ll see other prophets rise on the scene, new testament apostolic prophets. Why,
       is because the only way that God is able to reveal himself to the people is by a prophet. And the
       word of the Lord…
       Jeremiah 28:9-Reference quote:
       9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass,
       then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him.
       Amos 3:7-8-Reference quote:
       7 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the
       prophets.
       8 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy?
       2 Peter 1:20-21-Reference quote:
       20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
       21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they
       were moved by the Holy Ghost.
        The Bible is of no private interpretation to any person in the laity, but the word of the Lord
       and the revelation of the Lord comes only to a prophet. Why, is because a prophet is the only one
       that has a listening post down on the inside. And that listening post, he hears the word of the
       Lord coming forth from the prophet messenger and that listening post interprets the revelation to
       that prophet. And that keeps it pure! Now, if the other ministers, evangelists, pastor he cannot get
       it. It’s a total impossibility, I don’t care what anybody else says. I don’t care if you get mad, get
       puffed up get mad or do anything else you want to. I’m not responsible for the Bible. I’m not
       responsible for the people, but I’m only responsible for the Bible and what God said. The word
       of the Lord only comes to a prophet. There is no laity, there’s no person in the church of Jesus
       Christ. There’s no pastor, there’s no teacher, there’s no evangelist can get the revelation of God
       first. It first must come to the prophet, and from the prophet… Now Listen here! From the
       prophet, it filters down to the pastor and the teacher. And then they say exactly what that prophet
       said because they know they couldn’t get the revelation that it had to come from that other man
       and they know if they’re gonna to stay lined up with God they got to stay lined up with what that
       
       12
       prophet said. And that keeps everybody sayin the same thing. THAT’S WHAT’S THE

       got radio, see, and there is warnings and things can be done. Like a sword in your hand, see, it
       can pick from the evil or pick from only as its…it gets its message, see. 21 Now, but now, for
       instance, to the ordinary man, there has been so much cults and clans rise up, over little
       outpourings of the Spirit, until people gets all worked up in a bunch of stuff, go out and start
       another little move, and, you know, and—and thing. See? You don’t want to do that now. See?
       Now, just remember, just stay the way you are. 22 And you say, “Well, the Lord show…” No.
       Now just be careful, see. 23 Look here. Let me show you something, see. Did you know there is
       ten thousands of voices in this room right now? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Literally,
       voices of people that’s coming through the electronic waves of radio! Why don’t you hear them?
       They’re voices. That right? [“Amen.”] They’re waving right through here now. Well, there is
       peoples forms and bodies moving right through this room now. Is that right? [“Amen.”] Well,
       why don’t you see them? See? They’re here, actual voices like my voice. Well, why don’t you
       hear it? See? It’s got to strike something first, to reveal it. See? Now you understand?
       [“Amen.”] 24 Now just don’t interpret nothing. If God wants you know anything, He’ll send it
       to you. See? So just be real, real solid now. Hold still, something has happened. And now just be
       real…You understand what I mean, don’t you? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] And just
       be…Don’t try to make yourself odd, to be a Christian, because you—you take yourself away
       from God. And you—you—you… 25 If you can understand it, THIS IS THAT THIRD PULL.
       See? You—you should have caught that, the other day. See? So then, just remember, there’ll be
       no impersonation like there was of the other two. See? So, that’s as far as you—you should know
       now. Just—just remember that… 26 You see, now, there is something taking place in this room,
       and there is Something here. There is—there is, actual, in this room, Angels, Voice of God. See?
       But how do you…You can’t…If you can’t hear the natural voice, without something to send it
       out, how you going to hear the spiritual Voice? 27 Now you might make-believe that somebody is
       singing this certain song. They might not even be there, see. But when it actually strikes the
       crystal that it’s supposed to strike, then it gives a true interpretation, and show, vindicates it by
       showing the picture. See what I mean? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] 28 Now, the Spirit
       of God, when It speaks through the true Word, It vindicates Itself, to show Itself, that It’s
       right. You understand now?
        I don’t want to offend nobody, and I’ve waited all these years to say it but that’s exactly what
       the bride of Jesus Christ has got to have right now is a vindicated prophet of God with the word
       of the Lord. Because we gave them all these years, Christ has gave them all these years since the
       messenger’s been gone and they have made a mess out of the message. Why? Is because they all
       got the interpretation to it and none of them have any right whatsoever putting any interpretation
       to what God said. They should of went on preaching Jesus Name, one God, Seed of the Serpent,
       Revival and Restoration and left the revelation alone to the prophet of God that is called. You
       
       13
       say, well where’s he at? I don’t know that’s up to God see! He’ll prove see, I know it has to be

       REVEAL THE HIDDEN TRUTH THAT’S BEEN SEALED IN THE WORD. Do you see it?
       [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] It is then, in that day when this thing is to take place, that
       Jannes and Jambres, the impersonators, will appear again. Just like they did when Moses
       appeared with the original Word, to say It, they appear to impersonate It. Just exactly right. Now
       you see what Matthew 24:24 is? See, anointed ones! 263 Now there’s three things we’re going to
       say before we close. This is it. I want you to listen real close now as we close. Three things,
       remember, three things have been fulfilled. Three things lays before you right now. 264 First.
       The world is in a Sodom condition. Jesus said it would happen. Look at the perversion; our
       women trying to act like men; our men trying to act like women, sissyfied; rotten, filthy, lowdown, devil-possessed, and don’t know it. The Bible said that would happen, and that’s where
       it’s at. 265 Secondly. It’s in that hour, according to the Scripture here, that Jannes and Jambres
       appears. Secondly. 266 Thirdly. It’s in that same hour that the Son of man is to be revealed.
       
        Now how many went home and read those pages I gave you in the seal book? What Brother
       Branham told you, how many read it? Read it over and over and over again. It’s a total
       impossibility for the people to catch the revelation.
        But notice, that when the man that Gods called… Listen to, “Trying to do God a service
       without his will” There’s three things you must remember, it must be Gods man that he called to
       catch the revelation, it must be God’s season and what he says must be in the word that’s already
       brought by the prophet before him.

       65-0718M - Trying To Do God A Service Without Being The Will Of God
       William Branham
       110 But there is five musts. I want you to remember these. No matter how sincere a man may be
       in doing it, doing God a service, this, these five must be there. First, it must be His time to do it.
       111 What if—if Moses would come, say, “We’ll build an ark and float up the Nile, like Noah
       did”? Noah’s time was all right for an ark, but not his time. 112 What if Jesus would come, said,
       “Now I’ll tell you what we’ll do. We’ll just go up on the mount, like Moses did, and get a new
       declaration of laws”? See? Huh-uh! He was that law. See? 113 You must be in His time. It
       
       14
       must be in His season. You got that now? Must be in His time. It must be in His season, time
       and season. 114 And it must be according to His Word that has been spoken. It must. I don’t
       care how well you say this ought to be, or that ought to be, or this ought to be. It’s got to be
       according to His Word; according to His time and His season. And it must be given according,
       to the person He has chosen to do it by. 115 I don’t care how much dignitaries. There is king
       David, just as great as any of them. He was king over the nation. But He had a way of doing it,
       and He had told them how He would do it. But they failed to do it. 116 It must be according to
       His Word; according to His time, according to His program. 117 And it must be by the person
       He has chose to give it and to do it. Moses tried to run from it, “Take somebody else.” But God
       chose Moses to do it. Many of them; Paul tried to get out of it; many others. But it’s got to be by
       the one He chooses to do it. And it must come, first, to His prophets. The Word of God must
       come to His prophets. Amos 3:7, “The Lord God will do nothing until first He reveals It to His
       servant the prophet.” Four. 118 And the prophet must be vindicated by the Word of God. 119
       There is your five musts. It’s got to be that way. His time, His season, when He said it would
       be; and the man that He chose; and it must come to the prophet; and the prophet must be a
       vindicated prophet. We find out, many of them in the Bible, it come to the prophets and it
       wasn’t vindicated. Our Prophet is Jesus Christ.
       
        Now notice there as the word of the Lord comes to the prophets. Never does it come to the
       teacher, never does it come to the pastor, never does it come to the evangelist, it only comes only
       to the prophet. Because they are made up in such a way, they never made their self that way,
       they was born that way with a listening post and revelation comes to the prophet of God because
       he has a gift to catch the word and when the word hits that gift it interprets it and shows the true
       interpretation.

       So He had to be identified to the world; and that day down on the river, when He walked down to
       prove Hisself God’s Masterpiece (that I talked about this morning)…When He was obedient to
       walk into the water… 100 Now, if you notice there, there’s a great lesson. John was the greatest
       man on earth, at the time. Jesus said, “There never was a man borned of a woman as great as
       he,” to that time. And he was a prophet. You believe that? Now, remember, if the Word of God
       will come to anything in the land, it’ll be a prophet. That’s always God’s way. Do you believe
       that Jesus was the Word manifested in flesh? So there’s only one way He can come to be
       introduced; not by the priests. 101 He didn’t go up and say, “Caiaphas, will you introduce Me?”
       If He did, He made the same mistake that David did in our lesson the other day; see, if He went
       up to the church, and said, “Will you introduce Me?” 102 Just notice when He was borned,
       even. When He was borned, He was borned in the shadow of the church. And they was probably
       rang the bells and everything, but it was shepherds that recognized Him, and Magi. See? 103
       And here He is now, on…ready for His ministry. And if He is the Word… 104 According to
       God’s great plan, the Word can only…“The Lord God does nothing until He first reveals It to
       His servants the prophets.” That’s always His pattern, has to be; when the Seals were opened,
       when anything else. Any major event taking place in the earth, God reveals it to His prophets.
       
       15
       105 And John was the prophet, for he was prophesying “He’d come.” 106 Then down off the
       side of a hill one day…when a discussion was going on, a bunch of priests standing around. And
       they said, “Do you mean to tell me that you call yourself a ‘prophet,’ and stand over there in
       that mud?” (not in a church, because they wouldn’t have him) “Stand over that mud, and tell me
       that the hour’s coming when the great Jehovah Who ordained these sacrifices, when great
       Jehovah Who built this temple, Who came into it as a Pillar of Fire, ‘the day will come when that
       daily sacrifice will be taken away’?” 107 HE SAID, “THERE WILL COME A MAN, AND
       HE’S AMONG YOU NOW (SOMEWHERE OUT THERE), AND HE WILL TAKE AWAY
       THE SIN.” The priest was discussing it with him. 108 John looked up! Now, what is he? The
       prophet! AND HERE IS THE WORD, THERE COMES THE WORD COMING RIGHT
       STRAIGHT TO THE PROPHET, RIGHT TO THE WATER. JOHN SAID, “BEHOLD, THE
       LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. There He is, that’s
       Him.” Jesus never spoke a word, walked right out into the water. And I can see there, standing
       in that water (think of a drama), two of the greatest that ever struck the earth: God the Word,
       and His prophet. 109 NOTICE, THE WORD COME TO THE PROPHET IN THIS
       DISPENSATION OF GRACE, IN THE WATER (UH-HUH). I THOUGHT YOU’D CATCH
       IT (UH-HUH). IN THE WATER! THE FIRST REVELATION OF THE WORD WAS IN
       THE WATER. NOW YOU SEE WHERE THE BRIDE STARTED, THE EVENING-LIGHT
       MESSAGE? IN THE WATER! THE WORD, TRUE WORD not mixed up with creeds, but
       come to the prophet in the water, by the water. 110 Notice! Could you imagine the eyes of the
       Word and the eyes of the prophet meeting in the water? Oh, that’s too much for me. There stood
       the prophet, there stood the Word, looking in each others’ eyes. And the prophet said, “I have
       need to be baptized of Thee, why comest Thou unto me?” 111 And the Word said…It has to be
       true. Now let me give a drama here: 112 “John, you’re a prophet, you know the Word.” See?
       “You recognize Me, you know Who I am.” 113 “I have need to be baptized of Thee,” John said.
       114 Jesus said, “Suffer that to be so. That’s exactly right, you do have need to be baptized of Me.
       But remember, John, being a prophet, it is behooving to us, or becoming to us (as the Word and
       the prophet), that we fulfill every Word. Uh-huh. For, John,” (here’s the revelation now) “John,
       you know Who I am, I am the Sacrifice. AND ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD, THE
       SACRIFICE HAD TO BE WASHED BEFORE IT WAS PRESENTED FOR SACRIFICE.”
       IS THAT RIGHT? THE WORD…“THE LAMB WAS WASHED AND THEN PRESENTED
       FOR SACRIFICE, AND I AM THAT LAMB. AND I MUST BE WASHED BEFORE I CAN
       BE PRESENTED TO THE WORLD FOR A SACRIFICE. SUFFER IT TO BE SO, JOHN,
       FOR THUS IT IS BECOMING TO US AS THE WORD AND THE PROPHET
       TOGETHER.” 115 Well, there can’t be a mistake. Now, every one of these things… 116 Now,
       see, if it wasn’t that very setup, John would’ve been like any of the rest of us; so they say, “Yeah,
       I—I know who You are, Lord.” 117 “Well,” He said, “wait a minute, I’m the Word. Uh-huh.
       ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word.’ Eve left off one uh-huh, but you got to
       take every Word. And I am that Sacrifice, and I must be washed before I’m presented. But
       what you said, John, is true.” 118 John being a prophet, knowing the Word had to be fulfilled,
       he suffered that and baptized Him. And when He was raised up out of the water, THERE
       COME THE MESSAGE FROM HEAVEN ON THE WINGS OF A DOVE, “THIS IS MY
       BELOVED SON.” HE SENT THE REDEMPTION MESSAGE OF GRACE ON THE
       WINGS OF A DOVE, COME FLYING DOWN OUT OF THE HEAVENS. “Peace on earth,
       good will toward men.” THE SACRIFICE WAS READY RIGHT THEN; BEEN RAISED,
       
       16
       FED, HIS MINISTRY WAS READY, A WORD THAT WOULD REDEEM THE WHOLE
       WORLD, “IT’S OVER!”
        And there’s three ways that God vindicates a prophet. First, he gives him the revealed word of
       God. And then the Bride if they are the elected Bride, they don’t have to have a sign or a wonder
       or miracle, an arm grow out or blinded eye open, when they hear the Voice of God they believe
       it. It’s the revealed word of God.

       28 And where does the fruit ripen at quickly? In top of the tree. Why? The light’s on it. Amen!
       That’s right. And right in the top of the tree, in this last days, He’s bringing forth a Bride
       Tree. 429 Now remember, He is that Tree of Life, contrary to “the serpent’s seed,” you see.
       He’s that Seed, “the woman’s Seed,” the Tree of Life in the garden. “And lest they put forth
       their hands and move this Tree, they’d eat that Tree and live forever.” And HE’S THE ONLY
       TREE THAT CAN BE TAKEN, THAT YOU CAN LIVE FOREVER. HIS WORD IS LIFE.
       And that be the Word then, THE WORD OF GOD WHICH EVE TURNED DOWN IN THE
       GARDEN OF EDEN; THEN HERE IS CHRIST, THE WORD, MADE MANIFEST. 430 And
       when He come on earth, He was the Tree of Life. Do you believe that? [Congregation says,
       “Amen.”—Ed.] And Rome, what did they do? He had to be chopped down. And He was put on a
       tree of disgrace, “cursed is he that hang on a tree,” become a curse for the human race. 431
       AND NOW THROUGH THAT, HE BRINGS FORTH A BRIDE TREE, WHICH WILL BE
       THE TREE OF LIFE RESTORED BACK TO HIM, AS HUSBAND AND WIFE IN THE
       GARDEN OF EDEN, (OH, GLORY TO GOD) BY THE SAME WORD AND THE SAME
       GOD MADE MANIFEST IN HUSBAND AND WIFE, THE SAME BRIDE TREE BACK
       AGAIN. 432 Notice, making it known! How…My, there’s just so much here, we could just keep
       on going. Notice, this Tree, of Christ’s Body, in the garden. Making, now making His mystery
       known to this Bride Tree. 433 Watch, REDEEMED BY CHRIST, THE SECOND ADAM. You
       believe He was? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Going back Home, to Eden, with His
       fallen wife redeemed back Home again. That’s Christ in the Church today, taking His Wife
       back. See the threefold mystery now? [“Amen.”] God manifested in Christ; Christ manifested
       
       17
       in the Church; all together, to bring back the original Adam and Eve again, man and woman,
       which are one, made out of the same Blood and same Spirit, and everything else. 434 THE
       CHURCH IS THE BLOOD OF CHRIST, BY THE SPIRIT, BECAUSE THE—THE LIFE IS
       IN THE BLOOD. THAT’S THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT BAPTIZES US
       INTO HIS BODY, THAT RECOGNIZES ONLY HIS BODY, HIS FLESH, HIS WORD.
       [Brother Branham pats his Bible—Ed.] 435 Denomination won’t, never touch that. IT’S A
       REVELATION. SHE KNOWS IT. SO DID EVE KNOW IT, BUT SHE FELL; BUT THIS
       ONE KNOWS IT, AND WON’T FALL. SHE IS ORDAINED! HALLELUJAH! WHEW!
       SHE IS ORDAINED TO NOT FALL. SHE WON’T FAIL. SHE IS PREDESTINATED TO
       IT. “Blessed is the man who God will not impute sin.” You ministers know what I’m speaking of,
       when there’s a couple dozen of you sitting here. See? “Blessed is the man who God will not
       impute sin,” David. 436 Notice, redeeming back, with Him, going Home; back to Eternal Life
       in a human body, eating, drinking, living forever. Isaiah said, “They would build houses and
       inhabit them, plant vineyards and eat the fruit. They’ll not build and another take it.” The
       children won’t take it, but they’ll be there with their offsprings. He’ll build it and stay there.
       Amen. “He don’t build, and another eat; he builds and eats, himself.” Amen! What is it? HIS
       BRIDE GOING BACK WITH HIM, REDEEMED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ADAM AND
       EVE AGAIN, FOR DEATH IS LEFT BEHIND. THEY LOOK BACK AT THE CROSS AND
       SEE THE DEATH HAS BEEN PAID. 437 And now, BY FAITH, we are resurrected with Him,
       sitting in Heavenly places right now, looking back to what redeemed us; waiting for the Husband
       to come, to march on Home with Him. 438 Threefold purpose of God, manifested in Adam and
       Eve, and every prophet, and down through the ages, and He that is to come; He that was, He
       which is, and He—He which is to come. THE WHOLE MANIFESTATION, THE
       REVELATION OF THE WORD OF GOD, ADAM AND EVE GOING BACK HOME
       AGAIN, REDEEMED, GOD MAKING HISSELF KNOWN! 439 There He’ll sit upon the
       Throne of David (That right?) and shall own, rule all nations with a rod of iron. There will be
       a—a tree on each side, and each nation that comes in, this healing will be for…these leaves will
       be for the healing of the nations. The kings shall bring their honor into it. There will be nothing
       that can defile, or anything ever enter in. And Mount Zion will have a Light on her, all day and
       night, and the redeemed shall walk in that Light. Oh, hallelujah! 440 To think, it’s not a mythical
       story, it’s not some theological conception. IT’S A REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST, BY
       HIS WORD, WHICH IS OUTSHINING, BEEN TRUE IN ALL AGES. And It’s true in this
       age. It’s true here now. It’s true with me, It’s true with you, and every man and woman that
       holds this revelation. Amen.
        What if the prophet of God comes and showed visions? That won’t move the elected Bride,
       they only hear the word, the Voice of God. And then when they hear the Voice of God they
       know that is the revealed word of God. And they know that the revealed word of God is coming
       into power so they stay with the man and they stay with that revealed word.

       337 John would have never know Him, no, sir, had the Holy Ghost not pointed out. See how
       God hides His mystery to the high, educated and everything? LOOK, EVERY ONE OF THEM
       PEOPLE, IN SIMPLICITY REVEALS IT TO WHOM HE HAS PREDESTINATED TO SEE
       IT. LOOK HERE! OTHERS STANDING BY AND NEVER EVEN SEEN THE DOVE,
       THEY NEVER HEARD NO VOICE, FOR IT WAS ONLY SENT TO THAT
       PREDESTINATED SEED. PREDESTINATED! Certainly, was predestinated! 338 Why,
       Isaiah, seven hundred and twelve years before he was born, in the Spirit, raised up out of
       these human senses, and said, “There’s a voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the
       way of the Lord, and make His…’” 339 Then, if Isaiah could see it, couldn’t Malachi see the
       same thing for a predestinated last prophet, the sealing off all the prophets of the Old
       Testament, that main…THAT GREAT PROPHET STANDING THERE AT THE END OF
       THE AGE? See? He’s saying he’s predestinated. Certainly, he was. Malachi saw him, too. 340
       Jesus said, “If you can receive it, this is he who was spoken of, ‘I send My messenger before
       My face,’ Malachi 3, ‘to prepare the way before Me.’” See? Sure, he was predestinated to see
       that message. No wonder he could look yonder and see that dove coming down, that Light that
       was in the wilderness with Israel, coming, moving down. 341 The God Himself, saying, “This
       is My beloved Son in Whom I’m pleased to dwell in.” God and man becoming One. 342 “I
       bare witness,” John said, “I beheld Him, the only begotten of the Father. I’m a witness of it.”
       Amen!
        Then the second thing God does steps in after he gives him the true interpretation of the bible,
       God steps in behind that man of God and vindicates him with great power signs and wonders.
       But that don’t make those that follow the revealed word of God a believer, they believed it
       before, the sign and the wonder. How many understand that?

       435 Remember, Moses, born for the work, had to wait on God for the extra gift for the job. He
       had to go back and wait, and for the time appointed by God. A certain pharaoh had to be on the
       throne, and the people had to be wanting the Bread of Life, before God would send him back.
       436 Now, with thousands of sign-workers in this last day, has created a generation of signseekers that knows no more nothing about the true move of God and His Word in these last
       days. As I have said: give them blood and oil, and fleshly demonstrations on the platform, and
       they’ll support it, whether it’s God’s Word or not, whether it’s Scriptural or not. Jesus have
       warned us of such things at the end time. As I have said: in Matthew 24, two spirits, very close
       alike, “Deceive the very Elected if possible.” 437 How can you tell them? Give them the Word
       test. How can you know it? SPEAK THE WORD, SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT. IF
       THEY DON’T BELIEVE THE WORD, THEY HAVE NO SEED-GERM IN THEM. They are
       
       19
       of the evil one, and deceive you. As the first bride was deceived, and the second bride was
       deceived, they are deceivers of the third bride, by hybreeding the Word, or trying to. GOD
       NEVER PLACED SIGNS AHEAD OF HIS WORD. (Amen. That’s a scorcher.) GOD NEVER
       PLACED SIGNS AHEAD OF HIS WORD. THEY WERE ADDED FOR PROOF OF THE
       WORD, BUT THE WORD IS FIRST. To prove it, Elijah said to the woman, “Bake me a cake
       first,” then watch the miracle happen. COME TO THE WORD, FIRST, and then watch the
       miracle. The Seed-Word, Itself, is what the Holy Spirit energizes. 438 How can a messenger
       sent from God just believe some of the Scriptures and not all the Word, deny part of It? The
       true prophet of God will proclaim the Word in the last days. Denominations will hate him. He
       will not pull any punches on them. He will be like he was when he come at the first Coming of
       Christ, “You generation of vipers.” But the predestinated will hear and will make ready for the
       countdown. The royal Seed of Abraham’s faith, like him, holding to the Word of God,
       regardless, for he was predestinated.
        And then the third thing God does, he proves it from heaven by his own Voice. That’s the
       three-fold vindication of God for this hour that we’re livin in.
        First the revelation comes to the man, that’s a vindication right there. What is a prophet? A
       prophet has the word of the Lord. A prophet stays alone with God until he becomes the word and
       that man is the word of God for this hour. And then God steps in and proves that word by
       vindicating it with his signs and wonders.
        And then the third thing God does is prove it from heaven. That’s the three-fold vindication
       of God we’re to receive for this hour.

       111 THERE STANDING, GOD OVERSHADOWED HIM, CLOTHED HIM WITH
       IMMORTALITY. AND A VOICE CAME FROM HEAVEN SPEAKING THAT HE’D
       ACCEPTED HIM. 112 Now, notice. Let’s drop back. Time’s about gone, but I want to get
       something to you. Peter got all excited; the supernatural had been done. There stood Moses and
       Elijah, both been dead for years. Here they were standing alive, standing there with Jesus:
       witnesses, two of the mightiest prophets that ever walked the earth standing by the side to
       WATCH GOD ADOPT HIS OWN SON. IT GIVE HIM ALL THE POWERS IN HEAVENS
       AND EARTH, GIVE UNTO HIS HANDS. 113 HE WILL DO FOR YOU THE SAME, IF
       YOU’LL STAND AFTER YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST, and make yourself a
       Christian, and act like a Christian should. If you’ll put your face in God’s Word, and your eyes
       towards Heaven, and let your pants’ legs be bagged at the knees, be reverent before God,
       there’ll be someday that God will take you over to a side one, where… and give to you a power
       and a gift that the whole world will know He’s been with you. That’s placing a son to his
       position. Hallelujah!
        Now notice, that is the only thing that will bring unity to the Bride of Christ, it’s the only
       thing. Why, he gave apostles and prophets on down for the perfecting of the saints for the work
       of the ministry till we all come into the unity of faith unto the statue of a perfect man.
        Now notice, that every one of those ministries must line up with the prophet’s ministry. A
       pastor an evangelist a teacher has no right whatsoever…” Well, I disagree with him but I think
       it’s this way.” If he says that, then he’s not a true God called man. Because every one of them
       pastors and every one of them teachers has the same holy ghost down inside of them. Has the
       same holy spirit down inside of them and it just makes them line up with the word of God. They
       can’t help it, see.
        So, it’s gonna be here, it’ll still be here. It may look like it won’t, it’ll look like were gonna go
       under, but we won’t. We’ll conquer the thing and just ride right over top of it.
        Notice here, that the last anointing that came to the church was an eagle anointing. I’m glad it
       said eagle, I’m glad I’m not livin in man age when intellectualism is comin forth, proven the
       Bible by intellectualism and phraseology and ideology, theology’s, I don’t know all them ology
       things. It said, an eagle! Because there is nothing that thrills the heart of a saint of God then the
       anointing of a prophet. An inspired prophet of God that catches the unadulterated revealed word
       of God. And it’s the revealed word of God that thrills the soul of his saints.
        So therefore, this last thing that Ezekiel saw here was an eagle anointing. And an eagle
       anointing is a prophet’s anointing. That’s the only kind of anointing that is to fall on the bride of
       Christ is a prophet’s anointing. A prophets anointing is to fall onto the Bride of Christ and they
       all may prophesy one by one. Amen. It’s the eagle age we’re livin in.

       (accessed as a free download from Tucson Tabernacle's Website)
       "I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and started praying, and I
       heard a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, 'What are you leaning against, over
       your heart?' And I raised back like this, my bare shoulders; naked from my waist up, hot. I
       looked back. And there was wrote in the quartz, in the stone, 'White Eagle'; just exactly what
       the vision said THAT THE NEXT MESSAGE WOULD COME FORTH BY. I was so excited,
       I run home; got a camera and come back the next day, and took the picture of it. It was still
       there, wrote in the rock: 'White Eagle.'"
        Now notice here, were goin down and what is the prophets seeing? He is seeing the glory of
       God being revealed through the seven church ages right on in through the church ages and even
       after the church ages is over, he is seeing the glory of God.
        Notice, that verse twenty-eight when the prophet kept looking and he saw this likeness of a
       man sitting upon a throne. He was fire from his head to the bottom of his feet, feet of brass, fire
       standing in fire, amber color light. And he was the glory of God being revealed. And it said, he
       had the appearance of a bow that is in the cloud, in the day of rain.
       Ezekiel 1:28-Scripture quote;
       28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of
       the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And
       when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
        Now notice here, what Ezekiel saw… open your bibles now to revelation 10 and put your
       finger in there and we’ll go back and forth. And work this out, what Ezekiel saw. Do you love
       the word? (Amen)
        Now notice here that Ezekiel seein' the glory of God in the last day. He saw this man as the
       appearance of a bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain.
       
       22
        Now we know that a rainbow is a token that God gave to the earth. And he’s ever remaining
       faithful to that token, see. And it represented a day of rain, it represented the day of rain. And so,
       when you see the covenant automatically you think of rain. It means rain, spiritual rain to us,
       we’re not concerned so much about the natural rain but the spiritual rain.
        Now notice, the last thing that Ezekiel saw was the anointing of an eagle and in verse 28, he
       saw this one sitting upon the throne in his glory. It was the appearance of a bow that was in the
       cloud in the day of rain, see. And when he saw it, he fell upon his face and a voice begin to speak
       to him when he saw this when he fell upon his face.
       Ezekiel 1:28-Scripture quote;
       28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of
       the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And
       when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
        Now notice here, in Rev 10:1, Look here now here’s another prophet, another prophet John.
       John here who wrote the book of the Revelation of Jesus Christ.
       Revelation 10:1-Reference quote:
       And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow
       was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
        “And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud.” Now, there
       is the same one that Ezekiel was looking at. The same one that John saw, coming down from
       heaven clothed with a cloud. This is not a thunderhead bringing natural rain to the earth, this is a
       cloud of glory. This is the Lord Jesus Christ the mighty angel coming down from heaven with
       the Voice. This is the Voice! The Voice Jesus Christ! This is the mighty angel Christ and he’s
       clothed with a cloud and that’s a cloud of Glory and he’s coming with a bow. Same thing Ezekiel
       saw he’s got that bow and that bow is the rainbow, showing you that now, now here’s coming
       the power of the spirit the rain, coming to the elected of God. Here is the Christ coming with a
       covenant. He had a covenant; he had a covenant see. A rainbow, where was it at? The rainbow
       wasn’t under his feet, IT WAS ON HIS HEAD! Showing you that the head is coming to the
       body now. This covenant Christ is coming to the covenant people, bringing coming in great
       glory of God.

       61-0210 - Abraham's Covenant Confirmed
       William Marrion Branham
       176 He said, “By this you’ll know what My covenant is, Abraham.” Abraham being spiritual
       knowed it. Why? That’s exactly what God did. He took His covenant Seed, which the real Seed
       was the promised One through faith, come forth out of Isaac, come forth Christ. CHRIST
       WAS GOD’S COVENANT. And what He did, He took Him up to Calvary, just like Abraham did
       his own son a few days afterwards, or a few years afterwards, after he was born. What did He
       do? He took Him on Calvary and He tore Him apart (Amen.), tore Him apart. He raised His
       body up on Easter morning and set Him on the right hand of His throne. But the Spirit that was
       in Him, He sent back down to the church. So the church, when this Covenant is brought into
       
       23
       its full strength, when the Covenant is confirmed with God, the church, the people that goes
       into this body here to be His Bride, will be exactly the same Spirit that was upon Christ, doing
       the same things, the same ministry, the same power, and it’ll come together and be Word by
       Word the same: confirming the Covenant. 177 Now, look at today; look what we see today and
       find out. What did I say about the pyramid? It’ll have to be honed and so perfectly set in, all the
       shavings and everything, till that headstone will have to fit just perfectly in. See? The rejected
       headstone will have to be come back. 178 The covenant, the Life that was in Christ is in the
       church, the Holy Spirit. Jesus said, “A little while and the world won’t see Me no more; yet ye
       shall see Me, for I…” I is a “personal pronoun.” “I’ll be with you, even in you, to the end of
       the world. And the works that I do, shall you do also.” Whew. Don’t you see it? What is the
       covenant church confirmed, is the one who has the Holy Spirit, that’s the… “We who are dead
       in Christ, we take on Abraham’s seed and are heirs with him according to the promise.” And
       if you’ve never received the Holy Ghost yet, you have never come into the covenant of God.

       30 On they came to a place they begin to murmur against God, and—and against Moses. And
       God had to have Moses to smite the rock. And we took what he smote it with, the judgment stick,
       which we realize that that was the judgment, God’s judgment stick. It was the one brought fleas,
       and lice, and—and turned the waters into a… Or frogs come up out of the waters and so forth
       down in Egypt, because it was God’s judgment upon an unbelieving people. And notice. The
       only way that God could lead them people out was by an atonement. And the only way that
       God can lead us out today, is by an atonement. And the atonement’s already made at Calvary.
       31 Notice. They’re going down in there, how perfect it was with the Scriptures. How Joseph, the
       younger son, rejected of his brethren: Christ, rejected of His brethren. He wore a coat of seven
       colors, Joseph. AND THE SEVEN COLORS, OF COURSE, REPRESENTED SEVEN
       COLORS IN THE RAINBOW, WHICH WAS A COVENANT. And God always has His
       covenant people. And then, this one young Joseph was killed, supposingly, by his brethren,
       and his coat was to be returned to his father. And I want you to see another thing, that he was
       throwed into a ditch, and was supposingly to be dead. But he was taken up from the ditch, and
       was taken into the greatest commercial city of the world, and was made a right hand man, that
       no man could enter into the gates or come into the courts, without first coming through
       Joseph: A PERFECT TYPE OF CHRIST. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD KILLED HIM,
       AND THROWED HIM INTO THE GRAVE. BUT GOD RAISED HIM UP. And today He
       sets at the right hand of His Majesty, and NO MAN CAN COME TO GOD EXCEPT HE
       COME THROUGH CHRIST. Is that right?
       
        Now notice here, that he had in his hand a little book opened, and he sat his right foot upon
       the sea and his left foot upon the earth and he cried with a loud Voice as when a lion roars. Now
       notice he was a lion, he was a Lamb, but he was a lamb during the seven church ages. But now
       the seven church ages is over, he now comes with a different kind of ministry now. A different
       ministry all together, it’s not a Lamb ministry at all, it’s a lion ministry. And the Lion is the tribe
       of Judea.

       (His right foot upon the sea and the left foot on the earth facing East.)
       Revelation 10:2-3-Reference quote:

       and get by with it. But now, here he comes as a Lion of the tribe of Judea and Judea was the one

       61-0108 - Revelation, Chapter Four #3
       William Marrion Branham
       102 DON’T FORGET THAT WORD “EASTWARD”! WHERE’S JESUS COMING FROM?
       THE EAST, IN A CLOUD OF GLORY. WHERE DOES THE S-U-N RISE? EAST. WHERE
       WILL THE S-O-N RISE? EAST. WHERE WAS THE MERCY SEAT SITTING? TOWARDS
       THE EAST. Why have I got you all sitting this way towards the east? Why? The altar is to the
       east. We’ll see it after while, how beautifully, I’m going to draw it out. I asked as many as I
       could to bring papers and so forth, to get these maps in a few minutes. All right: …sprinkle
       it…eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle…the blood with his finger seven times.
       103 Oh, isn’t that beautiful? “Seven times towards the east.” What is it? The Seven Church Ages
       shall be covered by the Blood. Hallelujah! Jesus Christ’s Blood just as sufficient in it, yesterday,
       today, and forever, and to every age, to save every sinner, heal every sick person, bring every
       miracle, every sign to pass. “Seven times,” way back yonder in the Old Testament, fourteen
       hundred and ninety years before Christ come. Think of it! Symbol, “seven times shall…” Then
       shall he kill the goat…the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood with the…in
       
       26
       the vail, to do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock,…sprinkle it upon the
       mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: And he shall make an atonement for the holy place,
       because…the…of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their trespasses in
       all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among
       them that is in the midst of—of their uncleanness. 104 What was it? “The mercy seat.” Where
       are they now? And there inside of the ark was the what? The law. And the law, to trespass one
       commandment was to die without mercy. But being that you could have mercy, the blood had
       to lay on the altar. They sprinkle the mercy seat. And the mercy seat is the altar where you
       kneel and ask for mercy. God forbid that we ever take it from our churches, the old-fashioned
       altar where men can kneel and call on God for mercy. And mercy is rich, and flowing free from
       the Blood of the Lord Jesus. Now, also, that’s the mercy. That’s mercy seat. 105 But you notice
       in here, it was not mercy seat, for there was “lightnings and thunder and voices.” There’s no
       lightning and thunders at mercy. That’s judgment. 106 Let’s turn to Exodus, 19 chapter of
       Exodus and the 16th verse. Exodus, 19 chapter of Exodus, and let’s begin with the 16th verse:
       And it came to pass… Listen what…when God ascended upon Mount Sinai: And it came to pass
       on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders…lightning, and a thick cloud upon the
       mountain, and the voice of a trumpet exceedingly loud; (What is the voice of the trumpet? Is the
       archangel.) so that all the people…(Listen!)…all the people…was in the camp trembled. 107
       “JUDGMENT!” Whew! They had marched out there and God had given them grace to travel
       by, but they had demanded a law. They…God wanted them to be interdenomination; they wanted
       to make a denomination out of it, something they could argue about, instead of just following
       God and living under His jurisdiction, under His power. GRACE HAD PROVIDED A
       PROPHET, GRACE HAD PROVIDED AN ATONEMENT (A LAMB), GRACE HAD
       PROVIDED ALL THESE THINGS, and yet they wanted judgment. They wanted something
       they could do. 108 God said, “Assemble them together, I’ll let them know what it is. I’ll show
       them what it is.” Read! Listen! And the voice of the trumpet got louder and louder until it
       shook the earth. You see what judgment is. I don’t want that. Give me mercy!
        So, here he’s comin now, as a Lion of the Tribe of Judea to reap the harvest. Coming as the
       Lion, no more as a lamb. And when the Lion the Voice of this one cried and when the lion
       roared and when he did seven thunders uttered their voices. Now here is the revelation of God
       coming forth from the book that was open. But the revelation of God was not written in the
       book, but yet it thundered something that will produce rapturing faith to the elected Bride. Why?
       Is because he is coming with a covenant, he’s bringing the Baptism of the holy Ghost with him,
       that’s your covenant, that’s your gift that’s seal of God. This is the headstone coming, what is it?
       It’s the King of the Lion of the tribe of Judea. The king is coming now with his kingdom and if
       he’s got a kingdom then he’s got to have subjects. And so, the voice brings utters to bring forth
       the subjects to the King, the revelation, see.

       358 This is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. “Nothing can be added to It or taken from
       It.” And if we put that in There, it don’t act with the rest of the Scripture. There is sixty-six Books
       
       27
       of this Bible, and not one Word will contradict the other One. 359 And then, if this is the
       continuation, for the sounding of these last trumpets, or these last Seven Thunders that’s
       coming forth, the mysteries, the last Seals, It’ll have to compete, or compare, with the rest the
       Scripture. And if them first Ones in there opened with a blast of thunder, the second Ones will,
       too, that’s on the backside. Watch what happens. If the vision was Scripture, then it must be
       interpreted by the Scripture, or a continuation of the same Scripture. 360 Notice, Revelation, 3
       and 4, “Seven Thunders.” Seven Thunders, and then notice, 3 and 4, and then (what?) an oath
       from that mighty Angel, that, “Time was finished.” When these Thunders, you see, brought
       forth their voices, then the Angel… 361 Just think of it! “An Angel, clothed in a cloud, and a
       rainbow covenant over His head.” Why, you know Who that is. “Put one foot on the land, and
       on the sea, and lift up His hand and swore, that, ‘When them Seven Thunders uttered their
       voices,’ that, ‘time would be no more.’” 362 And if the ministry of the mysteries of God is
       finished, what if that is them seven mysteries coming forth? And a humble, little church like
       ours, that the Almighty has come and regarded the low estate of His people! You say, “What? I
       don’t think so.” It might not be. But what if it is? Then time has run out. Did you think it? Be
       serious. It may be later than we think. 363 These stars falling into their constellation back
       yonder! That Angel coming, and said, “As John was sent to wind up the Old Testament and to
       bring forth the introduction of Christ, a Message will wind up the loose ends and will
       introduce the Messiah just before His Coming, the Message of the last days.” 364 Notice, the
       mighty Angel swore, with an oath, that, “Time would be no more.” 365 Now, I don’t want to
       keep you too long. Just think of this, a minute now. 366 Now listen. This Angel come down from
       Heaven. See? The other, seven angels of the seven churches, was earthly messengers. But this
       Angel…All the Message is finished; the seventh angel winds up the whole thing. And this Angel
       comes not to the earth; He isn’t a man from the earth, as the messengers to the church ages;
       that’s finished. But, this Angel brings the next announcement. And an angel means a
       “messenger.” And He comes down from Heaven, clothed in that Pillar of Light, Cloud, with a
       rainbow over His head. And a rainbow is a covenant. It was Christ, “With one foot on land,
       and one on the sea, and swore, that, ‘Time will be no more.’” Where are we at, sirs? What’s all
       this about? I’m asking you. 367 The other angels was messengers, men of the earth. But this
       Angel…These, that said, “To the angel of the church of Laodicea,” “To the angel of the church
       of Ephesus,” messengers of the earth; see, men, messengers, prophets, and so forth, to the
       church. 368 But, this One didn’t come from the earth. He come down from Heaven, because the
       mystery is all finished. And when the mystery is finished, the Angel said, “Time shall be no
       more,” and SEVEN THUNDERS THROWED THEIR VOICES OUT. 369 WHAT IF IT IS
       SOMETHING TO LET US KNOW HOW TO ENTER INTO THE RAPTURING FAITH? IS
       IT? WILL WE RUN, LEAP OVER WALLS? AND IS THERE SOMETHING FIXING TO
       HAPPEN, AND THESE OLD, MARRED, VILE BODIES ARE GOING TO BE CHANGED?
       Can I live to see it, O Lord? Is it so close that I’ll see it? Is this the generation? Sirs, my
       brethren, what time is it? Where are we at?
        Now hold it right there, hold your finger right there and will get back to that. Now we’re goin
       to go back to Ezekiel.
        Now we see here that Ezekiel was seeing the glory of God., the glory of God in the last days.
       Now let’s go on to verse two and carry it right on Chapter two.
       
       28
       Ezekiel 2:1-2-Reading scripture:
       1 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.
       2 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard
       him that spake unto me.
        “And he said unto me, Son of man,” Now there you are see, Son of Man now see. “said unto
       me, Son of man stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. And the spirit entered into me
       when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me”
        Now notice that’s exactly what John saw when he saw this great glory of God, this Christ
       coming down this great mighty angel from heaven. And when his voice begin to utter, John fell
       upon his face when he heard his voice, see same thing.
        Now notice here, now watch here what this voice is sayin to this man of God
       here.
       Ezekiel 2:3-4-Scripture Reading ad lib;
       3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation
       that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto
       this very day.
       4 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say
       unto them, Thus saith the Lord God.
        “And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel,” Now he’s tying that
       out today the church, “to a rebellious” church “that hath rebelled against me: they and their
       fathers have transgressed against me,” Now here after he’s seen his glory now, here’s this voice
       talking to this man that the revelation of God is coming to. Said now I’ve been speaking to the
       church, and now they have been rebellious to me. They won’t listen to my word they won’t hear
       a thing I got to say, their rebellious. “For they are impudent children and stiffhearted”.
       Uncircumcised in heart and hard of ears, see stiffhearted, stubborn, “I do send thee unto them;
       and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God.”
       Ezekiel 2:4-Reference quote:
       4 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say
       unto them, Thus saith the Lord God.
        Now notice that after he saw the glory of God after he seen this, then he fell on his face and
       the voice of the Christ that he saw begin to speak to him. The Glory that he saw, the voice of
       God came out of this glory begin to speak to this man and it begin to tell him about how
       rebellious the people was. How they wouldn’t listen to his words.
       Ezekiel 1:28-Scripture quote;
       28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of
       the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And
       when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.

       59-0628M - A Deceived Church, By The World
       William Marrion Branham
       59 But now what happened? It’s got the Pentecostals, the big Doctors of Divinity for their
       pastors, some great man. They’ve got just as much school and ritual as the Methodist or Baptist,
       or any of the rest of them has got. Go into a church and you can’t hear an “amen,” just as cold
       as a bunch of Eskimos right off the North Pole. Cold! Indifferent! “And now the Philistines is on
       thee, Samson.” 60 The Philistines is on thee, America. Where is that oneness of spirit? Where is
       the oneness of Pentecost? The Assemblies of God, and the United, and the church of God, and
       this, that, the other, each one with a different ism, this one with that, and this one with that.
       We’re so broke up till you can go into a city to hold a revival, if one church sponsors it, the
       rest of them won’t even attend. The Communists is upon thee, America. 61 Where is our
       Power? Where’s our glory? What is it? BECAUSE WE WENT AFTER THE WISDOM OF
       MAN INSTEAD OF THE POWER OF GOD! WHY, THEY GOT OUR PREACHERS AND
       THINGS IS SO STIFF AND STARCHY, TILL THEY’VE ORGANIZED US TILL WE’RE
       SO STARCHY AND STIFFNECKED, TILL PEOPLE…Do you ever hear a shout in the
       church anymore? You never hear anybody cry. The mourner’s bench is put in the basement.
       There’s no more glory in the church. All we do is sit back just as stiff as we can be. We’re not
       free. We’re bound. The devil, with his modernistic demons, has bound the church of the living
       God. That’s right. There’s no more Power in the church. There’s no more freedom. The
       people are so starchy and stiff! WHY, THE GOD CAN COME INTO THE MIDST OF
       PENTECOSTAL PEOPLE, AND SHOW THAT HE’S GOD, AND PROVE HIS SIGNS OF
       HIS RESURRECTION, IT DON’T EVEN SHAKE THEM. GLORY! WHY, IT’S A
       DISGRACE! I WALK ACROSS THE COUNTRY, GOD WORKING, PERFORMING SIGNS,
       AND PEOPLE SIT, AND, “WELL, I GUESS THAT’S ALL RIGHT. OH, I KNOW IT CAN
       BE DONE.” IT DOESN’T MOVE THEM! Why? They’re bound with Delilah, the world.
       They’re in fetters. 62 Now they’ve even got them into, bound them into a confederation. “The
       Philistines are on thee, Samson.” What you going to do about it? 63 “Oh, we’ve got great
       denominations.” Sure. “We have greater membership than we ever had.” But where’s the
       Spirit? Where’s the Holy Ghost? 64 That’s what the devil has done. It’s wooed into the
       church. It’s kept wooing the church, “Come to me, I’ll give you a great big tabernacle over
       here if you’ll just do this. If you’ll get rid of that fanatic preacher you got, and get a man, a
       Doctor of Divinity that’s got some sense, we’ll build a nice big classical church and we’ll be
       like the rest of them.” SHAME ON YOU! RATHER HAVE A MAN THAT DIDN’T KNOW
       SPLIT COFFEE FROM BEANS, BUT WAS FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, THAT
       WAS UNCOMPROMISED, BY THE POWER OF GOD. 65 BUT IT’S GOT, OH, SO
       STARCHY, TILL SOME POOR SAINT CAN BREAK THROUGH IN THE MEETING AND
       SPEAK IN TONGUES, OR SHOUT A LITTLE BIT, OR DO SOMETHING, AND THE
       REST OF THEM WILL ALL GANDER AROUND AND LOOK. “What was that? Well,
       wonder why? That must be a fanatic dropped in somewhere.” You know that’s the truth! Some
       poor saint step in, get happy enough to raise their hands, and cry and praise the Lord, somebody
       who will holler “amen” to the preaching of the Gospel, and the rest of them turn around and see
       what he said. That’s Pentecostals. What’s the matter? You’re patterning after the Methodist,
       after the Baptist; they patterned after the Catholic; Catholic patterned after hell. And, all
       together, it all after hell! Right. 66 Delilah has wooed you into big churches, fine, educated
       
       30
       ministers, take the better class. “Well, you know, So-and-so down here is a millionaire, if we
       would just get him to come into our congregation! Oh, my!” If he isn’t born again, then he
       doesn’t deserve to be there. I don’t care if he’s got a million dollars. If he owns forty Cadillacs,
       whatever he’s got, he’s got to be borned again, come right down to a new birth and be
       regenerated by the Holy Ghost, and come out of there in a new birth, snotting (excuse me), acrying and screaming, and carrying on like the rest of them do, and live a life afterwards to
       prove he’s got It. Amen. That’s what you need. 67 “Samson, the Philistines is upon thee.” The
       Communists is upon thee. The world’s upon thee. The devil’s upon thee. 68 They go back and
       they see the Spirit of God perform miracles and do things of His resurrection, what Jesus
       promised, they say, “You know, I think Brother Branham’s got a lot of mental telepathy. My
       pastor said it was of the devil.” 69 You poor, hypocritical, deluded infidel, all polished up, you
       wolf in sheep’s clothes! Jesus said, “If you’d have knowed Me, you’d have knowed My day.”
       But you’ve got a bunch of Sauls that try to make you like the rest of the world. 70 We want a
       bunch of men of God who don’t compromise on the Word, but preach the Truth and stand on
       the baptism of the Holy Spirit. 71 But what has the world done? It shaved all your Power off.
       You were born Nazarite, Pentecost, but the world certainly shaved your Power. Now it’s just as
       starchy as the rest of them. 72 What are we going to do? What’s going to happen? There’s one
       glorious thing that I can think of to end this text. 73 While Samson was bound! We can’t have a
       revival. Listen at our loyal brother, Billy Graham, “Revival in our day!” Listen at Oral Roberts
       scream, “Revival in our day!” Listen at the rest of them, “Revival in our day!” How can we have
       a revival when we’re bound? We’ve bound the Holy Spirit, with our organizations and
       traditions, and we can’t have a Holy Ghost revival. Amen. I know that’s scorching hot, with the
       weather, but it’s the Truth. How can we have a Holy Ghost revival when you’re so bound and
       starchy! “Form of godliness,” the Bible said they’d have. “Form of godliness, but would deny
       the Power thereof.” The power of what? The power of the organization? The power of the
       world? The power of the church? The Power of the Holy Ghost! That’s the secret place in the
       church. And when the church adopts educated preachers, and big buildings and finery, in the
       stead of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost, they’d better be in the mission again. Amen. True. How
       you going to have a revival of the Holy Ghost, and people quench It and bound It and are
       afraid of It? There’s where the trouble lies.
        Now watch here. Then he gives him a direct word of the Lord. Verse five.
       Ezekiel 2:5-Scripture Reading;
       5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,)
       Church, see! Yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
        Hold that there, the holy spirit is really speaking to me on that. Now he’s gonna get on that in
       a minute.
        Now… but…. Son of man, now listen here, the church has not received my word and their
       rebellious to my word. Now, I’m gonna send you unto them.
        Now notice here, here is the commission again to the Son of Man. Now here is the word of
       the Lord coming to the son of Man after he seen the glory of God, Christ coming down from
       heaven standing with one foot upon the land and one foot upon the sea with a little book open.
       
       31
       And he fell on his feet as one was dead John did, Ezekiel see. John just had to play that part
       because he had to speak it to somebody. See, it wasn’t to John but it was to this day. It wasn’t to
       Ezekiel but it was for this day. But yet Ezekiel, did go to Israel, but really what he was getting at
       was the end-time church Bride, see.
        Notice that every revelation that God hid in the Bible was for Christ and the Bride, see.
       Ezekiel 1:28-Reference quote:
       28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of
       the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And
       when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
       
        Now notice here, now he tells this Son of Man, this man that God is gonna use, that this
       church and the people are rebellious to his word. They are hardhearted and they won’t listen to
       God’s word and their rebellious. Now but he said, you go on to those people and take this word
       and whether they’ll hear or whether they won’t hear that’s none of your business, your job is to
       go tell them what I’m gonna tell you to say to them, see. And but this one thing, God said this
       one thing will happen, they are gonna know that there was a prophet among them.
        Now notice verse six here.
       Ezekiel 2:6-Scripture Reading;
       6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers
       and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor
       be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
       (Scripture Reading-Ad Lib)
        “And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers
       and thorns be with thee,” It’s ain’t gonna be a very pleasant ministry is it? “briers and thorns
       are gonna be with thee, thou dost dwell among scorpions:”
        What is scorpions? That’s the seed of the serpent. That in religious seed of the serpent, see
       imposters, playing off like they’re believers but all the time they’re a serpent sitting right where
       you’re feasting with the Lord. Judas’s see!
        “Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious
       house.” Church, see.
       Ezekiel 2:7-10-Scripture Reading;
       7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will
       forbear: for they are most rebellious.
       8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious
       house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.
       9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
       10 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written
       therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
       (Scripture reading ad Lib)
        7 “And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will
       forbear: for they are most rebellious.
       
       32
       8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious”
       Bunch you see. “open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.
       9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
       10 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written
       therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.”
        Notice here that this voice of God that was speaking out of the glory of God that descended
       down upon the earth, this angel that come down out of heaven which was Christ, see. He shall
       descend from heaven with A SHOUT and WITH A VOICE of the archangel.
       1 Thessalonians 4:16-Reference quote:
       16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with A SHOUT, WITH THE VOICE of the
       archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

       1 And when the Seals are broke, and the mystery is revealed, DOWN COMES THE ANGEL,
       THE MESSENGER, CHRIST, SETTING HIS FOOT UPON THE LAND AND UPON THE
       SEA, WITH A RAINBOW OVER HIS HEAD. NOW, REMEMBER, THIS SEVENTH
       ANGEL IS ON EARTH AT THE TIME OF THIS COMING. 42 Just as John was giving his

       happen before Jesus appears. Now, a shout…Jesus does all three of them when He’s He’s—
       He’s—He’s descending.
       A shout, what is the shout? It’s the Message going forth, first, the living Bread of Life bringing
       forth the Bride.
        Notice here, that this Voice begin to speak out of this glory from Christ and he told this voice
       coming forth thundering told this man that these people were rebellious. That they did not
       receive his word, that they were hardhearted, stiffnecked, uncircumcised harden of ears and have
       always resisted the holy ghost and they’re doin it now.
       Acts 7:51-54-Reference quote:
       51 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as
       your fathers did, so do ye.
       
       33
       52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which
       shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and
       murderers:
       53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.
       54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their
       teeth.
        Now he said that he brought unto him by the hand of God, brought unto this man the little
       book that was written in and without. That is the seven-seal book. Ezekiel was seeing the sevenseal book of revelation that was now open. Notice that it was written within and it was written on
       the backside.

       12 Now, before we open this Book… There’s no man can open this Book. I might turn the pages
       back, and say “We’ll read a chapter from here.” But God is the only One can open this Book.
       You remember in the heaven, the Book was laying sealed with seven seals on the backside.
       You remember that? And did you ever think that we have come through Luther’s justification,
       through Wesley’s sanctification, through Pentecostal Holy Ghost, and still we’re kindly
       muddling along? THERE’S SOMETHING ELSE TO BE REVEALED. IT’S NOT WRITTEN
       IN HERE; IT’S IN THE SEALS. We’re going to teach on those things, the Lord willing, when I
       come back. Remember, Daniel heard those seven voices, uttered their voices, and he started
       writing; He said, “Don’t—don’t write it.” SEE? “IT’LL BE REVEALED IN THE LAST
       DAYS.” Is that right? 13 John saw the same thing, and when he saw it on—on there, this Book
       on the backside, after it was done been taught all the way through, ON THE BACKSIDE HAD
       SEVEN SEALS. And these was to be loosened when the mystery of God would be fulfilled.
       We’re at that time, for the seven mysteries to be opened up to the church. Oh, what rich
       teaching this Bible produces. But no one—no one was able to even take the book, look
       thereon, or to loose the seals. AND THERE WAS A LAMB, THAT HAD BEEN SLAIN
       FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, COME TOOK THE HAND OUT OF
       THE—THE BOOK OUT OF THE HAND OF HIM THAT SET UPON THE THRONE, AND
       OPENED THE BOOK, AND LOOSED THE SEALS THEREOF.
        Now notice in Rev 10:7 the ministry of mal 4:5… I hope you get this clear now! The ministry
       of Mal 4:5 was not fifteen years of evangelism manifesting the two signs of God. But the
       ministry of Elijah, that was not the ministry of Elijah healing the sick opening the blinded eyes,
       and demonstrating the gift of the sign of prophesy and the sign that was in his hand. That was not
       the ministry of Elijah, that was the work of an evangelist. But notice the ministry of Elijah was
       only one thing! And it did not last but just a few years. Only lasted a few years, in fact from 1963
       to Dec 1965, the ministry of Elijah only lasted from 1963 to 1965 when Elijah left. And his
       ministry was to do only one thing, not to evangelize for fifteen years but his ministry was to open
       the seals that was on the book, that’s all! And then his ministry is over he decreases and the
       angel from heaven begins to increase which is Christ the Headstone.

       128 And He said, “Return! Did not I tell you, in the beginning, TO DO THE WORK OF AN
       EVANGELIST? When I called you, down on the river, did not I say, ‘AS JOHN THE
       BAPTIST WAS SENT FORTH TO FORERUN THE FIRST COMING’? Wasn’t John more
       than a prophet? Jesus said so, Himself, ‘What’d you go out to see, a prophet?’ Said, ‘More
       than a prophet.’” 129 Then it all begin to come to me. I begin to—to wonder. Then He
       reminded me again of the—of the people. HOW, DOING WHAT MOSES DID, how could
       Moses reach the people in the wilderness? And how could I reach the people in the wilderness?
       Exactly the same thing. Then it come to this, Second Timothy 4. Remember when we dedicated
       the church that morning, thirty years ago, some of you old-timers, when He showed me them
       trees and I planted them on both sides? Remember that? You remember the vision. It’s all wrote
       in books and on tapes and everything. Been years ago, how I seen these and I—I never crossed
       up the Oneness and the Trinity. I stood between them and planted these trees, and they were the
       only two trees that had fruit. And I…All the trees grew up about thirty feet and stopped. These
       went plumb into Heaven; broke off of the same branch. See? One on one side and one on the
       other, and I broke them. You remember the vision. See? It’s wrote in books and it’s in my life
       story and all. And they went plumb up into Heaven like that, quickly. And He said, “Hold out
       your hands for the fruit.” And then I found the same fruit in the cross, when I run down there.
       And He said, “‘Do the work of an evangelist. Make full proof of your ministry. The time will
       come when they’ll not endure sound doctrine.’ Don’t quit then. Keep going.”

       wisdom in the—of the world, and talents of that type, listen to a man that talked like me? They
       wouldn’t do that. And so I said, “They won’t believe me.” He said, “As the prophet Moses was
       given two signs to vindicate his being sent of God (See?),” said, “so will you be given.” Now,
       that was something not in the educational realm, but out in the Supernatural realm. See, see?
       And said, “The first thing, you’ll know diseases by taking people by the hand. And then it’ll
       come to pass, that you’ll know the very secrets of their hearts, and the things that’s happened
       in their life, and be able to tell them from the beginning to the end.” And said, “THEY’LL

       know, when you see a sign, a true Bible sign, there is a true Bible voice behind it. If there is no
       voice follows the sign, just the same old theological voice, forget it; it never come from God.
       There is, always. Told Moses, “IF THEY WON’T BELIEVE THE FIRST SIGN, THEY’LL
       BELIEVE THE VOICE OF THE SECOND SIGN.” THERE HAS GOT TO BE A VOICE
       WITH THE SIGN. ABSOLUTELY! And if it’s the same old theological voice, forget it. You
       already had that. It’s something; GOD IS TRYING TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF
       THE PEOPLE, BY A SIGN, AND THEN GIVE THEM THE VOICE, WHAT’S BEHIND

       whatever you want to. I don’t know who is going to…what’s going to take place. I do not know. I
       just know that those Seven Thunders holds that mystery. The Heavens was quiet. Everybody

       HOUR NOW, THAT THIS GREAT PERSON THAT WE’RE EXPECTING TO RISE ON
       THE SCENE MAY ARISE ON THE SCENE. 327 Maybe this ministry, that I have tried to
       take people back to the Word, has laid a foundation; and if it has, I’LL BE LEAVING YOU,
       FOR GOOD. THERE WON’T BE TWO OF US HERE THE SAME TIME. SEE? IF IT IS,

       to look and see what It was, see, see unfold to that much. Now, that is the Truth.
       
        Now notice here, that “BUT” In Revelation 10:7.
       Revelation 10:7-10-Scripture Reading;
       7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
       God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
       8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little
       book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
       9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me,
       Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
       honey.
       10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet
       as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
       
       36
        BUT now he was speaking of this angel Christ coming down from heaven with seven
       thundering Voices and a little book in his hand. Now notice here, BUT in the days of the voice of
       the seventh angel, there is Elijah! There is Elijah messenger to the church ages when he shall
       begin to sound BUT when he begins to sound. Now that was what was written on the inside of

       serpent, one God, Jesus name, women preachers, rapture all these great mysteries that was what
       was written on the inside of the book. But the book was written on the outside of the book and
       that is the seven thunder Voices of Revelation 10. That was written on the outside of the book.
       And this book was handed to this Son of Man and it was written from within and without and it
       was givin to him and he said eat it. Eat all of it! Showing you that the next ministry behind the
       messenger prophet and the book would be open that person and the whole Bible would be
       revealed. Everything that was on the inside of it and everything that was wrote on the backside
       of it. He said, eat it up. It’s not my words.

       WHEN HE BECOMES A LION, HE TAKES THE BOOK. THAT’S HIS RIGHTS. GOD
       HAS HELD IT, THE MYSTERY, BUT NOW THE LAMB COMES. 216 Nobody could take
       the Book. It’s still in the hands of God. No pope, priest, whatever might be, they can’t take (no)
       the Book. THE SEVEN SEALS HASN’T BEEN REVEALED. See? 217 But when, the
       Mediator, when His work is done as an Intercessor, HE COMES FORTH. AND JOHN…THE

       62-1230E - Is This The Sign Of The End, Sir?
       William Marrion Branham
       302 Notice Revelation 5:1. Listen at this now: And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon
       the throne a book written within (the writing was withinside) and on the backside, sealed with
       seven seals. 303 Now, there is writing on the inside of the Book. But, the backside had Seven
       Seals, on the back of It, that wasn’t written in the Book. Now, this is the revelator talking,
       JOHN. Now, remember, It wasn’t written in the Book. “And in the days of the voice of the
       seventh angel, all this mystery that’s written within should be finished.” It should be taken care
       of, in that day. Now do you see what I mean? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Are you
       following me? [“Amen.”] THEN IS THE TIME for the seven voices of Revelation 10 to be
       revealed. When the Book is finished, THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT, AND THAT’S
       THE SEVEN MYSTERIOUS VOICES OF THUNDER THAT WAS WROTE ON THE
       
       37
       BACKSIDE OF THE BOOK, THAT JOHN WAS FORBIDDEN TO WRITE. LET ME READ
       IT.
        Now notice here, the Voice that’s speaking to this Son of Man, said, take this book that was
       written within and it’s written without said take it in your mouth and eat it. Now what was that?
       That was the whole revelation, when he took the book… Now you know he didn’t take a natural
       book and chew up the pages and everything. But he took what God said from the book and he ate
       everything that was written within. He ate everything that was written within and he ate
       everything that was written on the outside of it. And when he ate it, he said that is sweet as
       honey. Notice, why did he say that when he ate it was sweet as honey? That was the revelation of
       God sweet as honey, it was just wonderful just sweet as honey. It was wonderful it was good.
       Oh, this is wonderful it’s good, Glory to God! It’s stimulation, its revelation, that goodness of the
       honey is revelation, see.

       50 And this Seven-Seal Book, remember, It was closed here, in Revelation the 5th chapter, and in
       Revelation the 10th chapter It is opened. 51 And now we’re going to see what the Book says
       about how It become open. And is not made known until the Lamb takes the Book, and breaks
       the Seals, and opens the Book. See? The Lamb has got to take the Book. 52 It’s hid. Now
       remember, “No man in Heaven, no man in earth,” pope, bishop, cardinal, state presbyter, or
       whoever he is, “CAN BREAK THEM SEALS, OR REVEAL THE BOOK, BUT THE LAMB.”
       And we have probed, and presumed, and stumbled, and wondered, and—and that’s the reason
       we’re all in such a confusion. 53 But with the Divine promise that this Book of Redemption will
       be perfectly opened by the Lamb, and the Seals thereof will be loosed by the Lamb, in the last
       days in which we’re living now. AND IS NOT MADE KNOWN UNTIL THE LAMB TAKES
       THE BOOK AND BREAKS THE SEALS. Because, remember, the Book was being holded in
       the hands of Him that sat upon the Throne. “And the Lamb comes to Him that sits upon the
       Throne, and takes the Book out of His right hand.” Takes the Book! Oh, that’s deep. We’ll try to
       solve it out if we can, by the help of the Holy Spirit. Now we’re depending on Him. And we will
       see, later, it is at the end time, “When time has run out.” 54 No denominations has a right for
       interpretation of the Book. No man has a right to interpret It. IT IS THE LAMB WHO
       INTERPRETS IT. AND THE LAMB IS THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IT, AND THE LAMB
       MAKES THE WORD TO BE KNOWN, BY VINDICATING AND BRINGING THE WORD
       TO LIFE.
        Now, that’s why Moses kept sayin it was a land of honey. Now if you heard me preach twelve
       years ago, if your spiritual you’ll know something.

       63-0116 - The Evening Messenger
       William Marrion Branham
       108 And the people who laughed and made fun and would not accept his message, they
       perished with the rest of the unbelievers. 109 BUT THE BELIEVERS WENT OUT AND
       ENTERED INTO THE PROMISED LAND, THEY WENT UNDER THE ANOINTED
       MESSAGE OF THE MESSENGER. IT WAS A MESSAGE OF DELIVERANCE, THAT
       GOD PROMISED HE WOULD BRING HIS PEOPLE TO A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK
       AND HONEY. And it happened, because God had already said so, and Moses come and was avindicated as the messenger of that day. Now, that brings it pretty plain to us. 110 All right,
       then we find out that Moses was correctly identified. 111 AND THEN AT THE CHANGE OF
       THE AGE, THE TIME COME FOR…BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE. THERE HAD TO
       COME A TIME THAT THIS SPOKEN MESSIAH WAS TO COME. We find out that the
       time that the people had twisted the law, made it all under a great group of something, and
       had all kinds of—of traditions of man, they had injected into it. AT THE CHANGING OF
       THE TIME CAME JESUS, ANOTHER PROPHET, GOD-PROPHET. NOW, YOU SAY,
       “HE WASN’T A PROPHET.” 112 The Bible said He was. “The Lord your God shall raise up
       a Prophet likened unto me.” HE WAS THE GOD-PROPHET, AT THE CHANGING OF
       TIME BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE, that He had spoke of for all these years. After He had
       give the law to Moses, then at the change of the time, when He said it would be done, then He
       come back to grace. And He sent a Prophet prophesying of the time. Now—now, the believers,
       He gathered them; the unbelievers perished in His day. All who believed on Him was saved;
       ALL THAT DID NOT BELIEVE HIS MESSAGE WAS LOST. 113 That’s exactly what took
       place in the days of Noah; that’s what took place in the days of Lot; that’s what took place in the
       other days, the days of Moses; that’s what taken place in the days of Jesus Christ. For they
       despised the message and perished, and those who believed the message was lost…or was
       saved. 114 Now, now, then comes the church dispensation in. We lived back in Noah’s time, the
       antediluvian; we come into the dispensation of law; then in the dispensation of grace, the
       church. And NOW THE CHURCH DISPENSATION IS ENDING. We all know that. 115 Now,
       if God did thus-and-thus in that dispensation, in those other two dispensations, He has to remain
       the same and do the same in this dispensation, ’cause He said He would do it. I’ll prove it in a
       few minutes, by the Word, that He said He would do it. Now, He cannot change His program,
       He’s God. Notice what He did in them dispensations. 116 Now we come to the church
       dispensation’s end time. That’s what I read tonight: …it shall be Light in the evening time. 117
       We’ve had plenty of dismal time, but there shall come Light. THE SAME SON THAT CAME
       AND CHANGED THE DISPENSATION THEN, COMES AGAIN! That’s going to be from
       earth to Glory. We’ll go in that. One time we went in, the other time we went out, and this time
       we’re going up! See? All right: in, out, up. We’re coming to the end time. And we’re not only
       coming, we’ve already arrived. We are at the end time! 118 What does God find in this end
       time? God finds in this end time just exactly what He found in other end times, unbelief! He’s
       always been that, He, when He comes, He—He finds unbelief. He finds that the program that
       He laid down to the people… 119 Back there in Noah’s time, if they would a-lived after His
       ordinances, offered the sacrifices…They got away from it. When He come, He found this, that
       thing operating wrong. 120 The same thing He did when He come on earth, He found the people
       and the Pharisees, and so forth, after the law. What was they doing? Just no sincerity in it at all,
       
       39
       just go ahead and slop it through any old way, and “Just as long as they joined the church,
       and that’s all they needed.” And that’s what He found. 121 And that’s what He’s found again!
       He finds the same thing, people doesn’t change. So if He sent His program and the people
       disbelieved it there and they perished, THEY BELIEVED IT AND LIVED, (NOW, ON
       THOSE TWO), IT’S GOT TO BE THE SAME ON THIS TIME. IT’S GOT TO BE THE
       SAME. No… 122 IT’S ALWAYS BEEN A FIGHT FOR THE MESSENGER TO SEPARATE
       THE OLD FROM THE NEW. IT’S ALWAYS BEEN THAT FIGHT, FOR—FOR THE
       MESSENGER COMING IN TO SEPARATE OLD FROM NEW, THOUGH ALWAYS THE
       MESSAGE MUST BE SCRIPTURAL, NOW, FOR EACH HAS FORETOLD OF THE
       OTHER TO COME. 123 Now, let’s take, for instance, Jesus. How hard it was, Him to come in
       and change the message from law to grace. Yet the Bible said it would come that way,
       “There’d come a—a Messiah, and the daily sacrifice would be taken away.” And we know it
       was prophesied through the prophets. What a great thing it was for Him to do that. But we find
       that He did it. And the one…He did it because the Scripture said, and the believers of that day
       (so-called believers) absolutely would not agree with Him. 124 Look at those Pharisees,
       Sadducees, they had their own traditions and no one’s going to shake them from it. That’s what
       they believed, their mother believed that, their daddy believed that, and their grandpa, grandma
       believed that, and “Moses said so!” BUT THE SAME MOSES THAT GIVE THE LAW WAS
       THE SAME MOSES SAID THIS GUY WOULD COME, AND THEY FAILED TO
       RECOGNIZE IT because they had got the true Word of God in traditions and had left off the
       main principle of It. And it had to be that way. 125 Notice, each one foretold the other one
       would come. Each one of the messengers, after the message, foretold it would come. Now, but
       the people always takes the message of the day that they’ve had, they set it up.

       64-0320 - God Identifying Himself By His Characteristics
       William Marrion Branham
       51 But, you see, Moses, being the correct prophet of God, not only had the fundamental parts,
       but had the identification of God. See, he was in line of duty, exactly what was promised for that
       age; not for the age of Noah, but for the age then. “I will take you to a land that’s flowing with
       milk and honey.” They were on their way, and Israel was identified with their prophet, Moses,
       with the Message of that age. God characteristics identified in Moses. A Pillar of Fire was
       following him. He also had the atonement in action; not speaking of it, but had it in action. Not
       what will be; what is right now! 52 Notice, he had a brass serpent that had been lifted up for
       the sickness and diseases of the people, therefore Moses was practicing Divine healing. He
       had the atonement, the brass serpent, symbolizing that God was in the camp, and the people
       were looking on that brass serpent and being healed. 53 HE ALSO HAD A SMITTEN ROCK
       FOLLOWING HIM. AND THAT WAS IDENTIFYING GOD, TO KEEP THE WATERS OF
       LIFE AMONG THEM, JOY AND SALVATION, THAT THEY WOULD NOT PERISH BUT
       HAD EVERLASTING LIFE. IT WAS A TYPE OF…THAT SMITTEN ROCK IN THE
       WILDERNESS WAS A TYPE OF CHRIST BEING SMITTEN.
        Now notice here, Honey was revelation and it was sweet as honey. Now notice here, though
       he ate the revelation from the book it was wonderful it was sweet as honey. Now there’s no food
       
       40
       that God speaks of that’s any better than honey. If he wants to talk about anything wonderful, he
       always speaks of it as honey. So, this is the most wonderful thing that God could give one of his
       children is the revelation of the little book. Notice here that when this man began to eat it, it was
       sweet as honey and he was getting revelation and it was wonderful. But when that revealed word
       of God dropped down in his belly then he said it turned bitter. Much bitterness and then he said,
       there was written there in lamentations mourning and woe. Notice here that he already saw a
       whirlwind of the Lord coming out of the north with judgement. Right! Now notice that when he
       ate the little book, though it was wonderful and glorious and made him happy it was sweet as
       honey, but when that word got down in his soul it began to turn into Judgment. It begin to turn
       into woe, woe and lamentations.
        What did Jesus Christ, when he come in there… what… did he eat the book? He was the
       book, he said, low I come in the Volume of the book that is written of me. And he come in there
       and He said, “woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, woe unto you lawyers, woe unto you
       hypocrites.” He turned over the tables of the money changers and all that.
       Hebrews 10:7-Reference quote:
       7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
        Notice that written within this book was lamentations mourning and woe. Showing you that
       coming forth out of this revelation is coming forth Judgement. Even though the revelation is
       wonderful and sweet, to those that taste of it. Yet God turns that revelation… there’s something
       about what God Is getting ready to do that he turns that revealed word, when it gets down inside
       you, it turns it into bitterness inside of you, see.
        Now notice here see, they are goin to know now, now they are goin to know that there was a
       prophet among them. Now God is gonna let them know that there was a prophet among them.
        Notice here as the Voice of God spoke to Ezekiel, I believe it is just like it is today to God
       speaking today, God speaking today. Notice that they had turned down Jehovah Gods word they
       didn’t want nothing to do with the word of God. They’ve been killing his prophets and stoning
       them and everything else.
        Now that’s just like today. God’s Revelation 10:7 church age messenger Elijah our precious
       brother Branham was put on the outside of the churches, put on the outside of the churches and
       we saw Christ knocking trying to get back in. Think about it! Where is his precious name
       mentioned among all the people today?
        How I laid there last night with the holy spirit upon me, weeping and crying and groaning
       and moaning in the holy spirit. Why, they never mention his name now. Once he was the talk of
       every spiritual mouth that was in the land was talking about Brother William Branham. Brother
       William Branham, Brother William Branham trying to get him in a meeting. Thirty thousand,
       forty thousand, fifty thousand letters a day then fell off till he didn’t have but twenty-five to ten

       my text and so forth and to minister like I should. I have started something. My meetings has
       always been a low ebb for a long time. I’ve seen it. So I asked the Father to help me, and I seen
       the dropping down in my mail, drop from fifteen hundred letters a day down to about fifteen
       letters a day, because no one could put their finger on me. I was gone somewhere and waiting till
       the Lord told me for a move before it ever moved. And it wasn’t a act of faith then, it was just
       simply just waiting, waiting, waiting.
        No more do they ever speak of the precious man of God. Never is he even mentioned on their
       lips. It is even as though today among the religious world that he was sent to, that he didn’t even
       come at all. They have completely forgotten him. How many was at his funeral? One or two and
       they never shed a tear. WHY, BECAUSE THEY’RE GLAD THAT BALD HEADED
       TROUBLE MAKER IS GONE, they’re glad of it. Don’t tell me I know! They’re glad he died,
       they’re glad he died the way he died. Now that proves to them that he was in error on the word
       of God and the wrath of God fell upon him. They may have forgotten the little prophet, BUT
       I’LL TELL YOU ONE THING! THE SAME ONE THAT’S SPEAKING TO ME, TELLS ME
       HE HASN’T FORGOT HIM!! AND THEIR GONNA KNOW THERE WAS A PROPHET
       AMONG THEM! Amen! They may have forgot all the great signs and wonders and miracles.
       Fifteen years of cancers melted away, heart troubles disappeared, goiters disappeared. Blindness
       was healed, lame legs begin to walk, broken homes were put back together. Alcohol patients
       miraculously healed and delivered. They have so easily forgot what Jehovah God done. THEY

        Now brother God has never left the earth without a witness. And there’s got to be somebody
       STANDING ON EARTH WHO HAS EATEN UP THE LITTLE BOOK. Which is the
       revelation message of the prophet messenger AND THEY ARE GONNA HEAR FROM GOD!
       THEY’RE GONNA KNOW THAT GOD HAS LOVED THAT PROPHET. Now they think that
       they can walk over God’s bible and walk right over the truths that God’s prophet had brought
       and get by with it and speak in tongues and have a great big revival. AND HAVE A REVIVAL
       WITHOUT THE WORD OF THE LORD? NONSENSE! There is only one thing for them and
       that’s the judgement of God! There’s only one thing for them. No God has not forgot the labors
       of his prophet. He has not forgot all the messages and all the audiences that he had spoken to.
        No sir, but written there in that book is lamentations, mourning’s and woes. We’re living in
       the hour of judgement. There’ll be a… God help me, sure as the world there’ll rise on the scene a
       judgement prophet a sure as I stand here and will bring judgement on them people for what
       they’ve done. Mark my words and see if it doesn’t happen. God’s not gonna let them get by with
       what they’ve done.

       William Marrion Branham
       227 Remember, they were very religious people that did that. They wasn’t outsiders. They were
       religious people of that day. And that’s what’s doing it today, is the religious people; same
       crucifixion, same thing today. Quickly… 228 “There they crucified Him,” then, then. Sure.
       Then they were rejecting God’s Word made manifest, accepting their creeds instead of the
       Word. 229 Is that what they’re doing today? That’s exactly, doing the same today. He was the
       Word; and they rejected the Word. That’s one point I want you not to miss, see, I want you not
       to miss. He was the Word, and when they rejected Him, they rejected the Word. And when they
       did reject Him, they finally crucified Him. And that’s what they’ve done today: reject the Word
       of God, and accepted their creeds; and has crucified, publicly, before their congregation, the
       working of the Holy Spirit. AND THEY’RE GUILTY, AND I INDICT THEM IN THE NAME
       OF JESUS CHRIST. 230 Fifteen years I’ve seen Him move across the land, and still they hold
       their creeds. They’re guilty! They took the Word that would have brought the church, all the
       churches together, and made a great big union brotherhood amongst Pentecostals and all the
       rest of them; instead of doing so, they rejected It, and turned It down, has made fun of It, and
       called It everything now. 231 And now, by a federation of church, through the devil’s plan,
       trying to come in and say, “Now we’ll come, buy some Oil.” They are rejected. And
       they’ve…They are guilty of crucifying Jesus Christ. You take it on God’s terms, or your terms
       won’t work. See? 232 They rejected God’s Word made manifest, for their creeds, and they’re
       doing the same today. “He was the Word,” John, Saint John 1. Hebrews 13:8 says, “He’s the
       same yesterday, today, and forever.” Now they are crucifying Him afresh. 233 Did you know
       the Bible said we could do that? How many would like to read just a little bit? Will you give me
       another fifteen minutes of it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] All right. Let’s turn over now,
       just a minute, a “crucified afresh.” Let’s go over to Hebrews, the 6th chapter, and read just a
       little bit. Hebrews the 6th, and see if we “crucify the Son of God afresh,” see if it can be done.
       You say, “YOU CAN’T CRUCIFY HIM THE SECOND TIME.” 234 WE’LL FIND OUT
       WHETHER WE CAN OR NOT. GOD’S WORD IS TRUE. Is that right?
        As even the prophet said, the truth lieth in the streets, the truth was lying in the streets and
       they walked right over top of it. But I tell you their gonna hear right from Jehovah God again!
        Notice here that as the voice of God was speaking to the prophet Ezekiel after he saw the little
       book written within and without. And was told by the voice coming from that angel himself,
       
       43
       “Eat that book!” Don’t you be rebellious like all the rest of them, “BUT YOU EAT MY
       WORDS, EAT EVER BIT OF IT!!”

       56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
       57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall
       live by me.
       58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are
       dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.

       62-1104M - Blasphemous Names
       William Marrion Branham
       288 Now, one thing more. Will you permit it to be said? Day before yesterday morning…You’ll
       notice on the—the board out there, a vision. I had a vision. It was about five o’clock, as my wife
       back there knows, or six. I had woke up. We got up to get the children ready to go to school. 289
       I just have these, now and then. And you all know, every one of you here, that they never fail.
       They, they are absolutely perfect. See? They never fail. 290 And I thought that I was the happiest
       person I ever seen. I was standing in the sun, s-u-n, and was—and was preaching the Gospel to a
       large, mammoth congregation. 291 [Brother Branham pauses—Ed.] I just wanted to see if it was
       being taped. 292 A—a large, mammoth congregation, and they were setting in a forest. And
       streaks of the sun was shining down on them, just here and there, getting It, getting the Word.
       293 And I’m, as usual, always too long, too late, preach too long. And I preached so long, until
       the congregation become hungry for physical food. And they, some of them, got tired. So they
       just got up, went out to get them some food, started going out. I said, “Don’t. Don’t.” 294 I had
       two climaxes I wanted to meet, I wanted to meet, in my sermon. And the Lord had give it to me.
       And any preacher knows, when you really know it’s God has give it to you, you just burning to
       tell the people. 295 And I was just preaching, Charlie, just as hard as I could preach, just laying
       it on, you know, and say, “All these great things, this what God is doing. Look at this. He
       discerns the thoughts of the heart. What is It? The Word.” And go like that. And, oh, I wish I
       could remember what I would say and what my text was. I can’t think of it. See? But I was just
       preaching away. 296 And I was watching myself do it. And then when I was standing there,
       looking, and watching myself preach It. 297 And I was just preaching, to-who-wouldn’t-have-it.
       And after a bit, I raised up, you know, and I thought, “Glory to God!” I said, “Look at these
       wonderful things, and this, that!” 298 Directly, I noticed the people begin to get like they was
       
       44
       physically hungry. And so they had enough spiritual, so they started walking away. And some of
       them…[Brother Branham yawns—Ed.] Started walking away. I thought, “What’s the matter with
       everybody?” 299 And—and I looked, and here some young couples going along, to my side. I
       thought…I said, “Just a minute, friend! Just a minute! YOU’LL BE BACK AGAIN WHEN
       THE EVENING SHADOWS FALL.” SEE? I SAID, “YOU’LL BE BACK AGAIN. But let me
       give you this first climax. Where does all these things come from, that I’ve showed you?
       Where are they from?” I said, “Here they are. They are in the Word of God. They are THUS
       SAITH THE LORD, His promise. Cause,” I said, “all of you bear me record, witness this, that
       my commission is, ‘Stay with the Word.’” I said, “What’s the matter with all of you? Can’t
       you understand the Word? You must understand It.” 300 And some of them said, “Man, I’d
       like to have some biscuits,” and so like that. 301 Well, I just thought, “Well, glory to God! If they
       want biscuits, let them go get them.” 302 So I—I turned around. I thought, “Oh, but, you know
       what? The shadows is going to fall, after while, right away.” I said, “Then, tonight, when that
       congregation gathers in again, I’ll put the climax to them, and told them that the things that
       they have seen me do is found in the Word of God, not in some mythical book or some
       organization. It’s found in the Word. See? Every bit of it, in the Word, ’cause I’m
       commissioned to That.” 303 I thought, “You know, they’ll, every one, be back tonight, so here is
       what I’ll do. I’ll background, kind of background.” You know the way I do it on these church
       ages and things, say what I said before. “I’LL BACKGROUND IT, ON THE WORD, AND
       THEN THIS GREAT, MARVELOUS CLIMAX.” I said, “What a time it’ll be! Praise be to
       God!” And I seen myself getting real little, and heard that, “Praise be to God.” I seen myself
       fading up like that. And here I was, standing there. 304 Now, here is the interpretation thereof.
       See? The first thing that I have done, the things that’s been done, has been mystical to the
       people, most of them. I don’t mean the Full Gospel and saints of God, but, I mean, in most the
       people. And you never want to look at the world, kosmos, as the Message of God. When you go
       and you say… 305 Like Boze said, “I’ve always…” Said, “I had a dream, years ago, that the—
       the God would send me to Chicago and shake Chicago for the glory of God.” I said, “Joseph,
       He has already done it.” “Why,” he said, “they haven’t been shaken since Moody.” 306 I said,
       “That? I’m talking about the Church. That’s cannon fodder out there. That’s just dust of the
       earth, that bunch cramming through the streets, painted Jezebels and everything.” I said,
       “That’s out there. Them big old lodges and things will crumble and fall into the streets there.” I
       said, “He is talking about the Church. The Church that seen the revelation of Jesus Christ
       made manifest, and they recognize It. They may not be fifteen out of Chicago. There may not
       be ten in this generation, out of the whole city of Chicago, come forth.” 307 Did you ever think
       of that? “As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the Coming of the Son of man, wherein
       eight souls were saved.” Uh-huh. How many come out of Sodom? See what I mean? I doubt
       being a handful. See? 308 But the Church Itself has received the shaking. They’ve recognized
       it. They knowed the Word. They seen the Word when It was being materialized, and they
       caught It. Now look at that for a minute, now. 309 And this first Message, when they’d see It,
       everybody rallied for It, said, “Oh, glory to God! Oh, if I could see this, that, and the other.”
       And they go right away, the same way they come in. See? 310 And now they think, “Well, I don’t
       know. Where would you join? If I don’t come to this, it’ll be this way. And I’ll be kicked out, over
       here, and I won’t have nothing to here.” Brethren set down and say, “Well, what would I do if
       I…?” See there? THEY WON’T STOP LONG ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE IT’S THE WORD
       THAT GOD PROMISED, BEING MANIFESTED. See? AND THEY WALKED AWAY. 311
       But, don’t worry, the shadows are close at hand, see, when I return to the field. 312 You
       
       45
       remember, the other night, of the Message that He give me back there when I was laying the
       corner stone? Just exactly. Said, “Do the work…” Said, “When you come out of this vision, read
       Second Timothy 4.” You know, it’s laying right there in the cornerstone, thirty-three years ago.
       313 Said, “Do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry. For the time will
       come when they will not endure sound Doctrine; but after their own lusts shall heap teachers,
       having itching ears; turn from fable…from Truth unto fables.” If that hasn’t been, just word
       by word! [Blank spot on tape—Ed.] 314 But, remember, then, the other night, when I never did
       read the rest of it. THE THIRTY-SOMETHING YEARS THAT I’VE PREACHED IN THIS
       TABERNACLE, NEVER ONE TIME DID I EVER GO ANY FARTHER THAN THAT, AND
       I DON’T KNOW WHY. 315 I often wonder, till, one day, I seen where Jesus picked up the
       Scroll and begin to read, and read half of the prophecy, and stopped, and said, there in
       Capernaum, He said, “And this day, this prophecy is fulfilled.” Why didn’t He read the rest of
       it? IT PERTAINS TO HIS SECOND COMING. See?
        I’m reminded of the words of Jesus Christ; he came in the volume of the book that was
       written of him. And said, man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth
       out of the mouth of God must a man live. And the book is open today, and we’re not to eat just
       want we want to eat of it, BUT WE ARE TO EAT EVERY BIT OF THE BOOK. Eat every bit
       of it!
       Hebrews 10:7-Reference quote:
       7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
       Matthew 4:4-Reference quote:
       4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
       that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
        Notice here, that when the prophet of God ate the little book that was written within and on
       the backside. He didn’t know it was gonna do that, but when it got down on the inside of him IT
       TURNED INTO BITTERNESS!
       Revelation 5:1-Reference quote:
       1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the
       backside, sealed with seven seals.
       Revelation 10:9-10-Reference quote:
       9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me,
       Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
       honey.
       10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet
       as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
        Notice here, what was it, God giving the man the revelation and that revelation begin to stir
       up his spirit, it begin to stir up his spirit. Stirring him up now, getting him ready to commission
       him and send him to those that were rebellious.
       
       46
        Did you know the Bible said, and the prophet messenger said, that the wrath of God abideth
       upon those that are rebellious? We’re living in the day of the LORD AND THE DAY OF GODS
       WRATH. And God will pour out his wrath upon the make believers and upon the unbelievers.
       Hebrews 3:15-19-Reference quote:
       15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the
       provocation.
       16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by
       Moses.
       17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose
       carcases fell in the wilderness?
       18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
       19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
       Colossians 3:6-Reference quote:
       6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
       Joel 2:31-32-Reference quote:
       31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the
       terrible day of the Lord come.
       32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be
       delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in
       the remnant whom the Lord shall call.

       54-1212 - He Swore By Himself
       William Marrion Branham
       200 God told—told Adam, “If you will touch this tree, you’ll…You eat from Here, you’ll live.
       You eat from that one, you’ll die.” THAT’S THE COVENANT. Now, that’s you, you’ve got
       the thing before you, “If you do this, if you do that, you’ll—you’ll die. IF YOU LIVE THERE,
       EAT THIS ONE, YOU’LL LIVE.” So, then, Adam eat from this, and he died. 201 GRACE
       COME ON, THEN GOD MADE A COVENANT BY GRACE. And, when He did, the children
       of Israel down in Egypt. God already said, by His Word, what He was going to do. He was
       going to bring them out. And God is obligated to His Word. But then when God, obligated to
       His Word, went down there and sent a saviour, Moses, grace provided that. Here come Moses,
       leading the children of Israel out, when they come out with him. 202 Got out in the wilderness,
       said, “Oh, give us something to do. We want to form us an organization, and we want you to give
       us something to do. Let us make us something like this. Give us a law to keep.” Exodus 19 was
       the greatest mistake that Israel ever made. WHEN GRACE HAD ALREADY PROVIDED
       THEIR SALVATION, THEN THEY WANTED SOMETHING TO DO, TO MERIT IT. GOD
       ALREADY SWORE TO ABRAHAM, WHAT HE WAS GOING TO GO. They said, “Let us
       have the law.” And the law never did; no one (never) kept it. They never did. 203 JESUS
       COME TO FULFILL THE LAW, AND GRACE PROVIDED A SAVIOUR AGAIN. That’s
       right. For, God had sworn, hallelujah, that He was going to save Abraham and his Seed. 204
       AND HOW COULD HE DO IT, WITH REBELLIOUS, STIFF-HEARTED, STIFF-
       
       47
       NECKED, YEAH, PEOPLE THAT WOULDN’T LISTEN, OR NOTHING? They had all their
       theologies and everything else, He said. How is He going to do it? This one is going to take this;
       and this is going to take that. And God looking down and seeing the churches in this day, how
       they was all conglomerated together, and all this kind of mess and things. HE HAD TO MAKE
       A WAY, FOR HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD DO It. Not only Jews! He said, “In thee shall
       all the tribes of the earth be blessed,” Jew, Gentile, alike. “I’ll call the Seeds.” Hallelujah! Oh,
       my! “I’ll do it.” And in this day…

       And, oh, how it parallels today. The Spirit of God is striving with man. And I wonder if God
       doesn’t think just about like He did in those times. It grieved Him that He ever made man, to see
       how rebellious men can be against His Spirit and His program and His way of life for men and
       women.
        But he will also bless AND BRING THE COVENANT BECAUSE HE’S COMING WITH A
       CLOUD WITH A RAINBOW WITH CLOUDS OF GLORY bringing his love and grace
       covenant to those that believed what’s written in the book.

       54-0814 - The Unconditional Covenant That God Made With The People
       William Marrion Branham
       And as they came down in this land, and all the peoples there was, everywhere, Abraham wasn’t
       any better than anyone else. But God, by sovereign grace and election, called Abraham,
       according to election. That’s it. No thing said that Abraham was any better. Don’t even say he
       was a believer, in the beginning, but God with un-… with His unmerited grace, Abraham was
       saved. And not only was he saved… But when God called Abraham, He saved him, and give
       him His covenant, unconditionally. 17 Never… He didn’t say, “Abraham, now, if you’ll do a
       certain thing.” He said, “I have, I, ye shall, I have.” Notice it, “You will come to me in an old
       age, in peace, right now,” seventy-something years before it happened, God said, “I’ve already
       saved you, and not only you, but your seed, after you.” When you get to thinking of that,
       without any merits, without anything, God’s covenant was unconditional to Abraham. God
       told him He saved him, and not only Abraham, but his seed, also.

       But if I come within myself, I’d miss it. You see? That’s my way. But God’s way is a different
       way. God does all things perfect. Anything that man does, any covenant, or anything else that
       man enters in with to God, he always breaks it. BUT WHEN GOD DOES IT, IT’S HIS

       60-0630 - God's Provided Approach To Divine Fellowship
       William Marrion Branham
       22 That’s the only place for Divine fellowship, is under the Blood. That’s the only remedy God
       knows. He based it… He’s infinite. What He says first, he has to always remain with that
       through His program. Now, when they’ll come to the courts, realizing that they’re defiled,
       setting in the congregation, knowing they’re wrong, BY FAITH THEY APPLY THE BLOOD,
       BELIEVE IT, ACCEPT IT, THE WATER—THE WASHING OF THE WATER BY THE
       WORD, CLEANSES THEM THEN AND MAKES THEM READY. 23 Now, here’s where the
       thing comes, here’s where the point comes. Most people says, “When I believe, that’s all I have
       to do.” Now there’s where the rub comes. The man that’s hit the water’s of separation could not
       yet enter into the holiest of holies. He could not yet come into the congregation. He accepted it,
       believed it, and believed it was for him, and he was sprinkled with the waters of separation, but
       as he went journeying on towards the place of fellowship, the first thing he had to meet, there
       at the door, was seven stripes for the seven church ages: God in all ages. Nothing but the
       Blood… AND HE HAD TO KNOW, THAT GOING ON BEFORE HIM WENT A
       SACRIFICE, BLEEDING. HE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THE BLOOD BEFORE HE COULD
       COME IN THE CONGREGATION. 24 NOW, WHEN HE COME UNDER THIS BLOOD,
       THEN HE WALKED INTO THE CONGREGATION, INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE
       SHEKINAH GLORY OF GOD AND THEN WAS IN FULL FELLOWSHIP,
       WORSHIPPING UNDER THE BLOOD. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF CHRIST AT
       PENTECOST, BRINGING HIS CHURCH INTO FULL FELLOWSHIP. It’s like the young
       couple that I was speaking of. When they get married, that’s not the whole thing. They haven’t
       done nothing but taken a ceremony. The minister has only said, “I pronounce you husband and
       wife.” It’s not ready yet. What does he do? He takes her to his house that he’s prepared for her.
       Now, many people here might disagree with me by this, but you don’t live but in a three room
       house. Oh, you may have many other rooms, but you’ve really only got three rooms. That is the
       kitchen, the living room, and the bedroom. You may have three or four bedrooms and you may
       have a kitchen and a dining room and so forth, but really a person only lives in a three room
       house. You live in a three room house in your body: soul, body, and spirit. God lived in a three
       room house: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Everything is in a three. And a three is a triangle.
       TAKE A TRIANGLE AND SHINE A LIGHT ON IT, WELL, WHERE THREE MEETS IN
       ONE PLACE, WILL PRODUCE SEVEN DIFFERENT COLORS. SEVEN DIFFERENT
       COLORS IS A RAINBOW. THE RAINBOW IS A COVENANT. Oh, it just keeps going on and
       on and on and on. On, because in that, God made a covenant through these three things: the
       hyssop, scarlet, and so forth. And the Light of God shining upon this, makes a covenant, a
       covenant that God made. 25 Now, when the woman is brought, the young bride (oh, how he
       loves her), but yet, they’re not truly in full fellowship yet. Now the first thing… What is the
       kitchen to do? Is where you eat. That’s like it is in the first courts of the church. You eat here.
       Come, set on the back seat, listen to the Word, and the first thing you know you begin to, “O
       God, that meant me.” You accept Him as your personal Saviour; by faith you grasp it. Then
       you begin to eat the Word. You begin to—to feel that you have accepted Christ as your
       personal Saviour. You begin to feast upon the Word; you enjoy It. Where used to you’d get up
       and walk out of the building if preacher didn’t say something just suited you—not right. You’d
       get up and walk out. But after you once accepted Christ, you’ve been separated then. The
       
       49
       waters by the Word of separation separated you from your evil thinking. Then the next thing
       comes is into the—the living room where you take your little bride. She takes her veil off. You’re
       coming a little closer. Then when you do you put your arms around her, talk to her, embrace
       her… That’s how it comes into the fellowship of the Lord Jesus. Before you do, you are
       separated from your sins. Then you embrace the Lord’s Gospel. You embrace the—the written
       Word. You believe It with all your heart. “God, it doesn’t matter what You want me to do,
       whatever you have planned in my life, I’m ready now to receive it.” That’s in the—the living
       room. Then, still you say, “Isn’t this far enough?” No, sir. 26 The next room is the bedroom.
       Then when you go to this bedroom, then it’s—you come into fellowship and relationship. You
       become into a relationship, then you have complete fellowship, because you cannot have
       complete fellowship until you become relationship. Anyone knows that. And listen. So is it with
       the church today. We got too many people; we got too many of them that’s ashamed to go into
       complete relationship with God to new life and new birth. If we’re the Bride of Christ, then why
       can’t we go into relationship, then all the shameness and backwardness and all’s gone from us?
       If we come into complete relationship, been borned again, I don’t care… The President of the
       United States could be standing on the street; you’d shout, “Hallelujah, Praise the Lord.
       Hallelujah.” You don’t care, because you’re come into a relationship. You’re borned again.
       You’re a new child. You’re in the Shekinah Glory with God, fellowshipping with Him. That’s
       what the ch… What we need today, brother, is a worship under the Blood, a worship in
       complete relationship, to die out. 27 What if the little bride said, “Now, wait a minute. I—I—I
       just… I don’t know… I don’t know if married life consists of such things.” She would never come
       into fellowship with her husband. She could never come into relationship or fellowship until she
       first comes into relationship. That’s what’s the matter with the church today, that say, “Oh, I
       don’t believe in that there kind of religion that makes you shout and call it ‘heartfelt religion,’
       and, I don’t believe in such things as that.” No wonder you’ve never come into it yet. You come
       into it and really get under the Shekinah Glory of God, when the power of the Holy Ghost is
       falling down upon you, you’ll know something happened to you, that you’ve passed from
       death unto Life and become a new creature. God is first.
        Never have we seen such a display of power signs and wonders and miracles for fifteen years.
       We saw a man so humble with the perfect love of the Lord Jesus Christ. A love of God that sent
       bee’s back to their nest. THE LOVE OF GOD THAT STOPPED A MURDEROUS BULL’S IN
       THEIR TRACKS. THAT STOPPED MANIAC’S IN THEIR TRACKS, THAT SUBDUED
       NATIONS WITH THE POWERS OF GOD and raised the dead and yet they’re disobedient to
       the word of the Lord. Never do they mention his name any more. His name is never mentioned
       in their churches and neither in their religious papers. But their hailing in a great world-wide
       revival. THEY’LL NOT SEE IT! There’s no revival to the world, only to the Bride of the Lord
       Jesus Christ. She’s the only one that’ll get the revival.
        No, they can’t walk over Gods Bible, walk over God’s truth. Mistreat the ones that he sends.
       No sir!

       55-1009 - The Way To Have Fellowship
       William Marrion Branham
       Wished I had time to tell you the experiences with wildlife, of what I’ve seen conquered by faith,
       by love. I told you the other night about the old opossum being sent up. I seen a vicious bull one
       day, was going to kill me. This is on record; I was a game warden at the time. I was going over
       the hill to pray for a sick man. And we’re supposed to pack a gun, but you wouldn’t go to pray
       for a sick man with a gun on your hand. So I took the gun and laid it in the little old truck, and
       crossed over through the field. And I was way out in the field and I knew… I had a—ought to of
       thought that this killer bull was out there, he’d just killed a colored man on a farm, Mr. Burks,
       just about three months before that, and they sold him up there to the people that had these
       Durham cattle. 28 And then when I started across the field, right out in a big open field, and not
       over about thirty yards from me, this big fellow raised up, and threw his horns down, and let out
       a big bellow, if you know what I’m talking about. And there he was, horns about like this. And
       here he come. At first it scared me. I—I looked for a tree, and there wasn’t any tree. And I know
       he could outrun me to the fence. So I thought, “Well, this is it.” So then, something happened. O
       God, if that would only stay there instead of going away. Something happened. I—I wish God
       would let it happen to everybody here tonight just long enough to get healed. See? 29 Something
       happened that I wasn’t scared of the bull. I felt sorry, because I disturbed him; I was in his field.
       He was laying out there not bothering me. I come along and woke him up. And so I felt sorry for
       him. Now, you can’t bluff it; it has to be there. That’s the way faith is; you can’t bluff; you got to
       really have it. The devil will know it. And this fellow started towards me with his head down, just
       as hard as he could. I wasn’t no more afraid of that bull then I would be of any of my dear
       brothers and sisters standing on this platform. And he run within about five feet of me, and he
       stopped, he looked at me so depleted; he looked right and left. I said, “Fellow, I’m sorry I
       disturbed you.” I said, “Now, you’re God’s creature, and I’m God’s servant. Now, the Creator
       that made you made me, and I am His servant. I’m on my journey across the hill to pray for one
       of His sick children. If I knowed you been laying there, I wouldn’t have come by and disturbed
       you. So now, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Creator, go back and lay down.” 30 At the
       judgment bar you’ll see it brought into light. That bull looked at me a few minutes, turned
       around, walked over, and laid down. And I—I stood there, the tears running down my cheeks. I
       walked within five foot of that bull, and he never even turned his head and looked at me. Why?
       Instead of hating him, I loved him. Love will conquer anything. Right. That’s what conquered my
       heart when I knowed that God so loved me that He gave His only begotten Son, that I wouldn’t
       have to perish. Knowed that I was born in this world a sinner, and was perishing, and God
       loved me that He gave His Son to—for my life to be redeemed. And then I—I couldn’t hate no
       more; I had to love. That’s what brings these results that you see. It’s love. 31 I don’t know. I
       might’ve told this, I have told it before, hundreds of little things that’s happened. One day I was
       mowing my yard. I had to get in the back yard, the front yard was growing up ’fore I get the
       back, account of people come being prayed for and things, from… See, as Joseph said a while
       ago, it’s just… Here, this is just—this is just Chicago. At home, it’s all around the world (See?),
       where people are coming and going from all parts of the world coming in. And when I was
       mowing this grass, I run in, forgot about it, there was a hornet’s nest back there. And I hit that
       fence with this mowing machine, and I was covered over with hornets, them great big fellows;
       they’ll knock you down when they hit you. At first I was scared, truly. No shirt on… And
       
       51
       something or another happened. I—I was sorry I hit those fellows, not because that I was afraid
       I was going to get stung, but really, it sounds juvenile, but if we could just be more juvenile. If we
       could be more childlike, it’s the simplicity of God that turns college students around. Be simple
       in those things. Just like a baby, just rely and believe. Don’t try to push yourself; just relax and
       believe it. That’s all. Don’t try to work yourself up, “O God, hallelujah, rebuke.” That’s no—
       no good. No, just believe it and walk on. That’s all. 32 So when that happened, I thought,
       “Them poor little fellows up there in their nest now, and here I done hit the fence and knocked
       them out of their nest,” that big old mowing machine I was pushing. And I said, “You’re little
       creatures of God, I’m sorry that I hit this fence. I’m—I’m sorry I disturbed you. Now, I’m God’s
       servant, and I’m praying for His sick children. I got to hurry and mow this yard. So now, you
       rush right back into your nest; I won’t bother you no more, in the Name of the Lord Jesus.” I
       started my mower off again and stopped it. I’d pull the string and started off like that and them
       bees just a humming all around my naked shoulders, and they took a beeline and went right back
       into their nest, without stinging at all. LOVE. I can’t produce it; I can’t work it up; God’s got to
       give it. 33 There’s where it is tonight. God has to give it. Then love produces a fellowship. Now,
       when God said back there… The day that sin had separated that Divine love, God told Adam
       and Eve not to eat these certain fruits, and they did, and sin brought separation. And sin by
       separation brought hatred, malice, strife, envy. Is that right? What happened? They separated
       from Divine love. And when you separate from Divine love, then you can’t overlook your
       brother’s mistakes no more. You got to bawl him out for it. That’s right. You can’t overlook
       sister’s mistakes no more. Because you’ve got away from that Divine part, that love part. But if
       you really love the Lord Jesus, if sister or brother, does something to you, “Oh, well, that’s all
       right, they didn’t mean to do it.” That’s the kind of love that Christ had, “Father, forgive
       them; they don’t know what they’re doing.” 34 What if He’d held my sins against me? What an
       awful person I was, but He loved me so well that He forgave me for them. When I was undone,
       He forgave me. He loved me, a pure love. And when Adam separated hisself from pure love of
       keeping God’s Word in his heart, when he did that, then he begin… These other faculties
       come in: malice, envy, strife, hatred, so forth.

       7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will

       9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
       10 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written
       therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
       Ezekiel 1:4-Reference quote:
       And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding
       itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of
       the midst of the fire.

       61-0101 - Revelation, Chapter Four #2
       William Marrion Branham
       146 Watch this prophet here, five hundred and ninety-five years before the coming of Christ, see
       how his vision compares with John: …a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud,…a fire
       unfolding itself, and the brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof was the colour of
       amber, out of the midst of the fire. Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
       creatures. And this was their appearance; they had a likeness of…man. 147 Notice, the color of
       the Spirit of God which was above the likeness of these four Creatures, was amber. Amber is
       yellowish-green. Now, watch, “yellowish-green,” amber, oh, He’s the same yesterday…He
       revealed Hisself to Ezekiel; in the midst of Ezekiel’s vision, this Light that he saw coming
       above the four living Creatures was yellowish-green. When He come to John, He appeared in
       the emerald which is also “yellowish-green.” He comes now to the revelator in yellowishgreen. He comes to us in yellowish-green, the Light! Walk in the Light, He is the Light. 148
       Let’s go to the 26th verse now, so we can read to the 28th. The 26th verse: And above the fir-…
       Oh, when you get home, I want you to mark that and read every bit of it. Save time: AND
       ABOVE THE FIRMAMENT THAT WAS OVER THEIR HEADS WAS THE LIKENESS OF
       STONE, AS THE APPEARANCE OF SARDINE STONE: AND UPON THE LIKENESS OF
       THE THRONE WAS THE LIKENESS OF THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN ABOVE…IT.
       149 THAT WAS THE SON OF MAN, SEE, CHRIST. Now watch how He was, how He was
       arrayed here: And I saw as the colors of amber, (watch, around this Son of man) as the
       appearance of a fire around about within it—about within it, from the appearance of his
       loins…
        Notice here, at the opening of the seals…right! At the opening of the Seals… what was it, at
       the opening of the seals? Brother Branham said, “Souls in Prison” He said, on Souls in Prison,
       what is the opening of the seals? He said, “It’s the loosening of a ministry.”

       62-1014 Stature Of A Perfect Man
       William Marrion Branham
       59 Now, these people are—are…Peter is saying here how that we must be partakers of His
       Divine nature. Now, each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of God.
       60 Now, after we get through with the Seven Seals, then at that time of the sounding of the Seven
       Seals, or the loosening... 'Course, we know what a Seal is; IT'S TO LOOSE A MINISTRY, to
       loose Seven Seals. And we'll see that right on the chart. IT'S LOOSENING A MESSAGE,
       SOMETHING THAT'S SEALED UP. 61 Last Sunday night, I preached on, “The Key.” And
       the key is faith. The faith holds the key, and the key is the Scripture. And Christ is the Door.
       See? So faith takes the little hinges of the Scripture and unlocks the glories and good of God,
       out to His people. See? So, it’s, faith holds the key that unlocks Christ to the people; unlocks
       it, reveals it. 62 So, today, we’re going to try to take that same key, to unlock the way to become
       a virtuous Christian in the stature of God, that, and be a living Tabernacle for the living God
       to dwell in. 63 Remember, God reveals Himself in three ways. FIRST TIME, HE REVEALED
       HISSELF IN A PILLAR OF FIRE, that was called the Fatherhood. THEN THAT SAME
       GOD, MADE MANIFESTED IN JESUS CHRIST, WHICH HE BUILT A BODY, MADE
       THIS BODY. THIRDLY, THROUGH THE DEATH OF THAT BODY, HE SANCTIFIED A
       CHURCH THAT HE CAN DWELL IN. It was God above us; God with us; God in us; the
       same God.
        Notice that when the seals we’re open it loosed another ministry, just what I’m talking about
       to you this morning. The opening of the seals was the loosing of a ministry. And he said on
       another tape, “Christ the Mystery of God Revealed” said the opening of the seals was releasing
       the ministry of the full body revealed word. Showing you that there would come forth a ministry
       that ate the whole book, everything that was written on the inside and everything on the outside.
       Amen! I believe that is none other than the carcase of the Lord Jesus Christ. Where the eagles are
       together around in the last days. There is to be a gathering together of the eagles. And they are to
       feast upon the full body revealed word the carcase, the body word the whole book.

       been the same thing through this Pentecostal age... NOW, NOTICE, BUT AT THE OPENING
       OF THE SEVEN SEALS, REVELATIONS 10, THE FULL WORD IS TO BE BORNED
       INTO MANIFESTATION AGAIN and vindicated by the Spirit of God in the full strength, as It
       was when It was here on earth, manifested in the same way, doing the same things that It did
       when It was here on earth. Amen! Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today,
       and forever. In St. Luke 17:30 Jesus said, "IN THE LAST DAYS, AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS
       OF SODOM WHEN THE SON OF MAN WILL BE REVEALING HIMSELF AGAIN, IT'LL

       94 But now, in—in the world of vision, this Man was not a vision. He walked up to me. I heard
       his feet as he walked. He walked up and spoke to me. And I was shaking like this, and he said,
       “Do not fear.” And when he said that, that was the same Voice I heard since I’d been a baby, the
       same Man. But he was a Man now. I’d seen him in a Cloud, in a Pillar, in a… And I’d seen him
       
       55
       in… I heard him in a whirlwind in a bush, talking to me. And but I never seen him as a man. But
       here he was as a man. 95 He said, “I’m sent from the Presence of Almighty God to tell you that
       your peculiar life and birth was for you to go to the world and pray for the sick people.” Said,
       “YOUR MINISTRY WILL SCATTER OVER THE WORLD AND IN THIS, WILL BRING
       THE GOSPEL AND THE POWER WHICH WILL BRING THE SECOND COMING OF
       CHRIST.”
        Now notice here, let’s read chapter three now a few verses here. Now notice he ate the book,
       right! It was sweet as honey, revelation to the man see. To those that eat the book. Chapter three
       verse one.
       Ezekiel 3:1-Reading;
       1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto
       the house of Israel.
        Now see why he called him Son of Man! How many see why he called him Son of man now?
       He was seeing into this last days this very thing that’s happening.
       Ezekiel 3:2-4-Reading;
       2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
       3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I
       give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
       4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my
       words unto them.
        Let’s skip down to verse 8, watch here verse 8…verse 7 lets’ read it.
       Ezekiel 3:7-Reading;
       7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all
       the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
        Now if you won’t believe on whom God sends, you won’t believe God if he come himself.
       That’s why he said this the work of God believe on him whom I have sent.
       John 6:29-Reference quote:
       29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he
       hath sent.
       John 6:35-37-Reference quote:
       35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger;
       and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
       36 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
       37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise
       cast out.
       
       56
       If you don’t believe him you wouldn’t believe me because that’s me speakin. “For They are
       impudent and hardhearted.”
       .
       Ezekiel 3:7-Reading;
       7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all
       the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
        Why are they hardhearted? They are hardhearted against the prophets of God. They’re
       hardhearted against the promise God’s trying to bring. Every bit of the preaching of God is to
       bring the people to the promise. That’s what he preaches for.
        Verse eight, watch here now.
       Ezekiel 3:8,9-Reading;
       8 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their
       foreheads.
       9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be
       dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
        Now let me stop here a minute. Now I want you to look at this here. Now God, even God is
       telling this man here that these spirits are bad. That these people that he’s gonna go to now, are
       gonna have bad spirits towards him, it’s gonna be hard to face them.
        Now you know that’s exactly the way it is today, I have never seen people with hardest spirits
       as they got. You almost just soon to go preach to people today as like to be let down in the pit of
       lions. It wouldn’t make you any more nervous or make you any more scared then to be let down
       in with hungry ravenous lions.
        Now God said now that their spirits are bad their spirits are hard, their hearts are hard and
       their spirits are bad. But he said now I’m gonna do something for you so you’ll be able to stand
       them hard spirits. He said, I’m gonna make your forehead as hard as flint. That you’ll be able to
       go in the midst of them people and drop the word of the Lord the revelation and said their spirits
       will bounce right off of your forehead. He said, “don’t you be afraid of them, don’t be scared
       don’t be afraid. Now you got the revelation, you’ve ate the book you know what’s on the inside
       and the outside, now I’m gonna send you to my people that have rejected me. I’m gonna send
       you out there and he said no matter how tough their spirits is don’t be afraid son, I’m gonna
       make your head as hard as a piece of flint. You look right at them and put your finger right in
       their face and say, “THUS SAITH THE LORD! REPENT OR PARISH!” It won’t bother you at
       all, just go right on.
        Have you ever seen an hour when people’s spirits are as bad and as hard as they are now?
       How many raise your hands know that’s so? Sure, they are.
        Now watch here, he has eaten the 7th seal book right! He has eaten the Seventh Seal book and
       God is telling him now that he’s gonna send him and is gonna make his head just as hard as flint.
       “Don’t be afraid, now you go and do what I want you to do.”
        Now notice here, we see the commission…we see the commission of the Son of Man after he
       has ate the book. Now notice you got to eat the book, you got to eat the book before you can run
       see. There’s no use running and trying to bring the word of the Lord, till you eat the book. It
       takes time to eat the book! But in the process of the man eating the book and digesting getting
       
       57
       the revelation, what’s written on within and without, God is preparing his head, his forehead
       against all his tough spirits he’s gonna face.
        I have to say this, I don’t believe there has ever been a day like today, I don’t believe there
       has ever been a people that’s so rebellious so backslidden so cold and so hardhearted against
       God’s promise. I don’t know any people that God could send a man to with spirits any worse
       than these that’s following Mal 4:5. But in there is a people, a Bride for Jesus Christ. You know
       it’s so, yes sir!

       wheat. As I said the other day, about the tree with the different branches in it. 161 Her long hair,
       Nazarite vow, shows that She is vowed to God. Her beautiful gown of His promised Word for
       the age that She is living in, wrapped around Her, vindicating Her with Himself, of Hebrews
       13:8, “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.” As, She is a part of the Word
       Groom, true to Him in every point. 162 Now look. If a woman goes out here and is married to a
       man, and she goes out and makes love with another man and has an affairs with him, and come
       back to her husband, he should kick her out. Is that right? She must be true to him, ’cause she is
       vowed to him. And the Bride of Christ is vowed to Christ; and He is the Word. Not even wink
       at the other side, a woman should not even wink at another man. She should make no signs,
       no emotions at all towards him, for she is absolutely a bride to one bridegroom. 163 We don’t
       want none of your mixed trees, your denominations. Be true to Christ, the Word. He’ll vindicate
       It to be true. No, sir, not even any emotion of anything towards making love to him, not join his
       ranks or anything else, or let him get you in his arms or in his care, or—or talk to you over this
       way, that way. You listen only to one Voice. “My sheep know My Voice. A stranger they’ll
       not…” What is His Voice? Any man’s voice is his word. And this is It, the Bible, not one word to
       be added to It or taken from It. Just stay right with that Voice. “A stranger they won’t follow,”
       a denomination. 164 As, She is part of the Groom, true to Him in every point, waiting the
       Wedding. Uniting, not at the ecumenical council; but in the sky, at the Wedding Supper. She has
       been given…This is for our own church. The…SHE HAS BEEN GIVEN, AND REVEALED
       TO HER, THE SEVEN-SEAL MYSTERIES OF THE BIBLE. See? She sees the folly of the
       deceiver, so very close to the Truth, that almost deceive the Elected. She sees it. She… 165 See
       the two opposing spirits at work in this evil age? Can you see it? Each very religious, Cain and
       Abel, spirits again coming to their heads, still same as they started. One, worshipping by
       beauty, and by knowledge, and by education, and by science, and by ethics. And the other One,
       
       58
       by faith of the revelation of the Word of God. Both of them is standing right in this building
       this morning. That’s right. 166 Revelation, or faith, in His Word, makes no claims of
       knowledge; the real, true Christian. They say, “Have you got a—you got a doctor’s degree?”
       Makes no claims. “I—I believe His Word.” See? Doesn’t make any claims. Doesn’t claim to be
       educated. Doesn’t belong to any denomination, any party, any sect. It belongs to Christ. It’s His
       Wife; not a church wife. She’s a prostitute. The Bible said she was a “whore,” and, “THE
       MOTHER OF HARLOTS,” and they all come together and make the same whore. And that kind
       of a woman is a woman that’s untrue to her Husband; and claiming Christ as her husband, and
       belonging to a denomination. Such nonsense! We belong to Christ. 167 But, in obedience, this
       little faith Woman, that lives by faith, the Bride; the person here, there; here, off somewhere
       else, some other church, some other denomination, whatever it is, in some not…Believes the
       Word of God, obedient, waiting in love, for the promise of the age to be confirmed. She is
       watching for it. She is part of that Word, and She is watching for Her life to manifest that
       Word. Brethren, can’t you see that? I hope that didn’t go over you. The Body is waiting for
       (which is the Word), waiting for the Life (which is the Spirit) to confirm or make It alive.
       That’s what She is waiting for. No other life will work in Her. She can’t come to life any other
       way. Yet, She feels it out there, and She knows it’s going to happen; then here it happens, then
       She wakes up. God said, “Let there be,” and She came forth like the first one come forth. 168
       “Children of disobedient” means obedience…Disobedience means “rebellion.” I looked THAT
       UP IN THE DICTIONARY, TO BE SURE. REBELLION, REBELLING AGAINST
       (WHAT?) THE REVEALED WORD OF GOD. LIKE CAIN REVEALED…REBELLED
       AGAINST ABEL’S REVEALED REVELATION, VINDICATED OF GOD THAT IT WAS
       RIGHTEOUS. And Cain rebelled against it, and slew his brother. The Pharisees, with their
       own denominational knowledge of what the Word of God was, selected hand-picked man,
       rebelled against the vindicated Word of God made manifest for the day, Jesus Christ, and
       killed Him. That right? That’s what “the children of disobedience” is, a rebellion against the
       Word of God. Now see where they are? “Oh, days of miracles is past. Jesus Christ is not the
       same yet. There is no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost. All that stuff is nonsense!”
       See, rebellion! They don’t have to say two things; just have to say one, that’s all. That’s
       rebellion, right there. They can’t say you don’t have eyes, you don’t have ears; you got to take
       the whole body, the whole Word. See?
        Notice here, it’s a whole like it was in the… Let me read this before I say that. Now let’s read
       verse thirteen, Ezekiel 3:13. Alright you see he’s getting his commission. Right! You see he’s
       done ate the book, he’s ate up what’s on inside of the book and he’s ate what’s on the outside of
       the book. Now the Lords getting ready to send him.
        Now there it’s a lot difference to be called then being sent. God calls a man then he prepares
       him. And then when he’s fully prepared and he’s ready then God commissions him and sends
       him forth, there’s where your great power and things take place see. But he’s just a man of God
       before that as he is after. Still the same man, still the same one, still preaching the same thing to.
       He never changes his doctrine.
        I’m glad God don’t change his mind. So, many preachers change their mind but God don’t
       change his mind. He speaks the same thing and never takes it back and only keeps giving you a
       continuation of it.
       
       59
        I think of ole Micah when he stood there that day and they finally worked themselves into
       unity. Finally worked themselves into unity. Finally worded themselves into unity. You know he
       had the word of the Lord and it was a continuation of what the prophet Elijah said before him.
       Elijah said the dogs will lick Ahab’s blood. Now a dog will never lick human blood but Elijah
       said a dog was gonna lick his blood. And that little man, and many years had passed by since
       Elijah had died, but that didn’t change one thing. God never forgot the word of the Lord that was
       spoken through the prophet Elijah. And this prophet of God Micah knew that was a major
       prophet Elijah who had the word restoration for the church. And they had finally managed to get
       them some great big intellectual preachers and then he got them into unity and they was… Oh
       I’m gonna say something here! That they was trying to get back the possessions to the church.
       The church had lost their possessions, their natural land, their houses lands and… if your
       spiritual now you know what I’m talking about. They lost their houses, they lost their lands, and
       there stood up a mighty intellectual preacher among them a prophet. A mighty one stood up
       among them and begin to tell them that it’s all right you lost… the world council of churches
       have taken your houses your land and your lots and everything but we’re working on something
       to get them back.
        Now if they’d been trying to take the people to a spiritual promise it’d been all right, but he
       was trying to give them a material possession back to them.
        And there was a man of God in the land that had ate'n what the prophet of Elijah had said.
       And he had not forgot it, and he had not forgot what Elijah said. And when they was all in unity,
       that God was gonna give them back their houses and their lands and their lots. He walked down
       there with… because that he stayed with the word of the Lord from the prophet of Elijah, God
       then gave him a continuation of the word, of the same word that was given to Elijah. And he
       walked down there, with thus saith the Lord, in front of four hundred and twelve plain prophets.
       And you know how the outcome was.
        And what was it… Oh I hope you get this! All the preachers thought they had the spirit. They
       all thought they had the holy Ghost but Mica was the only one that had the true Baptism of the
       holy Ghost down there. Among four hundred that thought they had it. What was it, where did the
       spirit lead me? He said, well you’ll find out, you’ll find out. Of course, you know how the
       outcome was, it’s no different today.
        Notice here, verse thirteen let’s look at this. Ezekiel said, “I heard also the noise of the wings
       of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them,
       and a noise of a” great “rushing” mighty Wind.” He’s getting his commission now.
       Ezekiel 3:13-Reference quote- Ad lib:
       13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the
       noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
        You know I know a hundred and twenty that ate the word of the Lord back in that day. And
       they were called but they wasn’t sent. And God said, don’t you go nowhere, don’t you go
       nowhere! GO UP THERE AND WAIT! WAIT UNTIL you be endued with power from on high.
       WAIT UP THERE! NOW TODAY IT’S NOT WAIT TEN DAYS OR FIFTY DAYS OR A
       HUNDRED DAYS, IT’S WAIT UNTIL YOU RECEIVE POWER. That’s the commission,
       that’s the commandment of God today. WAIT THERE UNTIL YOU GET POWER.

       Luke 24:49-Reference quote:
       49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of
       Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

       2 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given
       commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
       3 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen
       of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
       4 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from
       Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.
        You know, I guess one of the brother ministers at the tape got up and said, “You know I think
       we’ve waiting long enough, praise the Lord. I think we got this token when we believe!”
        You know there was a man that was sitting there with the keys on his side! Then all at once
       while they we’re all ready to leave the building he stood up and the keys kinda made a jangling
       sound and they recognized the one that stood. And they all quieted down and he said, “HOLD
       IT! The commission wasn’t ten days or nine days, THE COMMISSION WAS WAIT THERE
       UNTIL YOU BE ENDUED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH. Then you’ll be a witness unto
       me.”

       14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession,
       unto the praise of his glory.

       was hewed down and cast into the fire. Whew, what a Baptist preacher. Brother, that was one

       HE BELIEVED. He got It by unmerited grace. That’s exactly right. That’s the way everybody
       else gets it. Not when you believe, but, “HAVE YOU RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST
       SINCE YOU BELIEVED?” The gift of God is Eternal Life. THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
       GHOST COMES DOWN AND BRINGS SIGNS AND WONDERS. Amen. Oh, how I love Him.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 4 - The Smyrnaean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       Now I realize that it is going to be confusing for a moment here, as most people know that I was
       ordained a Baptist preacher and I have stedfastly declared that the Baptists have missed it for
       saying you receive the Holy Ghost WHEN you believe, for that is not so. You receive Him
       “SINCE you believed.” Acts 19:2-6, “He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost
       since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be
       any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said,
       Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance,
       saying unto the people, that they should believe on Him Which should come after him, that is,
       on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus. And
       when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with
       tongues, and prophesied.” There it is. Paul asked, “Have you received SINCE, NOT WHEN
       you believed.” And there is a great difference there, for it is AFTER we believe that we receive.
       Ephesians 1:13 is an exact word repeat of what happened in Ephesus according to Acts 19,
       “In Whom ye also trusted, AFTER that ye heard the Word of truth, the Gospel of your
       salvation: in Whom also AFTER that ye believed (not when ye believed), ye were sealed with
       that Holy Spirit of promise.” Now here is my point. Too many of our modernists and even our
       fundamentalists (so-called) believe unto salvation at a certain specific time which in many cases
       is called “making a decision,” and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again.
       Now to receive Christ is to receive His Spirit. TO RECEIVE HIS SPIRIT IS TO BE BORN
       AGAIN. To receive His Spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Amen. These folks believe.
       That is wonderful. But they stop there. YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST AFTER YOU
       BELIEVE. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY AND ALWAYS WILL BE. The very first
       word of direction to the people was by Peter at Pentecost and he said, “Repent, and be baptized
       every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive
       the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that
       are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” These directions came as a direct
       answer from Peter relative to what had actually happened at Pentecost. What came to pass was
       that God according to Joel was pouring out the promised Holy Spirit upon all flesh. He was not
       poured out before that time or given before that time. This was it. But THIS was to come from
       now on by repenting, being baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and then God was
       duty bound to fill the ones who came. Peter, or any of the apostles never said, “Ye must be born
       again, and then filled with the Spirit.” That this is the pattern of experience relative to receiving
       the Holy Spirit, note carefully the very next time that the Spirit fell upon a people. Acts 8:5-17,
       “Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. And the people
       with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles
       which he did. For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed
       with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. And there was great
       joy in that city. But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city
       used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
       to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of
       
       62
       God. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with
       sorceries. But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God,
       and the Name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. Then Simon himself
       believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the
       miracles and signs which were done. Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that
       Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who when they
       were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: (for as yet He was
       fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus.) Then laid they
       their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.” According to verse 12, THEY
       BELIEVED THE WORD. They were then baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus. But
       according to verse 16, in spite of all that, they had STILL NOT RECEIVED THE HOLY
       SPIRIT. It was only AFTER believing and being baptized correctly that they received the Holy
       Ghost. That is the exact pattern as set forth by Peter in Acts 2:38-39. Another Scripture that
       casts wondrous light on this is found in Galatians 3:13-14, “Cursed is every one that hangeth on
       a tree: that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that (in
       order that) we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” Now by no means can it be
       said that the “blessing of Abraham” is the rebirth, and that the “promise of the Spirit” is the
       Baptism with the Holy Ghost, as two separate events. For the Scripture reads thus: “Jesus died
       on the cross, and by means of that death and resurrection, the blessing of Abraham came on the
       Gentiles, leaving the Jews. This transpired in order that the Spirit might become available to the
       Gentiles.” To understand what I have just said is to clear up why students have never ever found
       Paul saying at any time, “Be born again and THEN be Spirit-filled.” They have inferred it is
       there, and they have put their own meanings to make it say it, BUT SCRIPTURE DOES NOT
       SAY THAT. Jesus never said it either. Look at John 7:37-39, and read it now with
       understanding. “In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any
       man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said,
       out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake He of the SPIRIT, Which they
       that believe on Him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was
       not yet glorified.)” Now it says here distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinking
       by coming unto Jesus in faith would have rivers of living waters pouring out of him. And it
       places this experience at Pentecost. Now keeping this thought in mind we read John 4:10 and 14,
       “If thou knewest the gift of God, and Who it is that saith to thee, Give Me to drink; thou wouldst
       have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.” “But whosoever drinketh of the
       water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a
       well of water springing up into everlasting life.” This same living water is mentioned, but this
       time it is not called a river; it is called an artesian well. There is where the people make their
       mistake. Because it is called a well and a river, they think that in one place it is eternal life given
       by the Spirit and in the next place where it is called a river (implying a great dynamism) it has to
       be the Spirit now given as an enduement of power. Not so. It is one and the same. It is the Spirit
       that gives life and power, and that came at Pentecost. WHAT IS IT THAT CAUSED THIS
       MISUNDERSTANDING? THE ANSWER IS, “EXPERIENCE.” WE HAVE GONE BY
       EXPERIENCE AND NOT THE WORD. AWAY WITH EXPERIENCE AS YOUR
       MEASURING LINE. THERE IS ONLY ONE PLUMB LINE, ONLY ONE ROD, AND THAT
       IS THE WORD. Now watch carefully and get this. Peter said, “Repent, and be baptized in the
       Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
       Ghost.” Paul said, “Have ye received the Holy Ghost SINCE ye believed?” THIS IS THE
       
       63
       WHOLE OF OUR PROBLEM RIGHT HERE. PEOPLE REPENT OF THEIR SINS, THEY
       GET BAPTIZED IN WATER, BUT THEY DON’T GO ON AND RECEIVE THE HOLY
       GHOST. YOU BELIEVE UNTO RECEIVING THE SPIRIT. Believing on Jesus is the step in
       the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost. BUT THE PEOPLE STOP THERE.
       THEY GO AS FAR AS WATER AND THEN STOP. THEY BELIEVE, AND THEN STOP.
       The Bible does not say that you receive WHEN you believe. It is, “Have you received the Holy
       Ghost SINCE you believed?” The exact and literal translation is: “Did ye, having previously
       believed, receive the Holy Ghost?” THE PEOPLE BELIEVE AND THEN STOP. YOU
       DON’T RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST WHEN YOU BELIEVE UNTO HIM, HAVING
       REPENTED. YOU GO ON AND RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. Do you see it? That is what
       is wrong with our fundamentalists. THEY HAVE NO POWER FOR THEY STOP SHORT OF
       PENTECOST. They are like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt and stopped short of
       the Promised Land. Now those children of Israel left Egypt about two million strong. They all
       journeyed together, all saw the same miracles of God, all partook of the same manna and
       water from the smitten rock, all followed the same cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night
       but ONLY TWO reached the Promised Land. ONLY TWO WERE TRUE OR REAL
       BELIEVERS. That is correct because the Word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief;
       and because of unbelief they could not enter in. (Hebrews 3:19.) Then since that is so, and
       only TWO ENTERED, then the rest were not true believers. What made the difference? TWO
       STAYED WITH THE WORD. When the hearts of the ten spies failed at Kadesh Barnea,
       Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they believed the Word and said, “We are more than
       able to take the land.” They knew they could because God had said, “I have given you the
       land.” After all those Israelites saw of the power and goodness and deliverance of God they
       did not enter into rest, which is a type of the Holy Ghost. SO YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW
       THAT VERY FEW WILL EVER BELIEVE ALL THE WAY TO RECEIVING THE SPIRIT
       OF GOD. Alright, we have come this far. Now I want to go further, and when I do I know I am
       going to cause some emotions to rise. But that is something I am not responsible for. I am
       responsible to God and His Word and the people God has sent me to.
        UNTIL, THAT’S WHAT WE NEED TODAY, NOT GOING ALL OVER THE WORLD
       TRYING TO EXPLAIN BROTHER BRANHAM WHY HE LEFT AND WHY HE DID THIS
       BUT WE NEED A PEOPLE THAT’LL FOR SAKE ALL THIS UNBELIEF AND COME
       TOGETHER INTO THE UNITY OF THE HOLY GHOST AND WAIT UNTIL WE HEAR A
       SOUND FROM HEAVEN LIKE A RUSHING MIGHTY WIND AND FILL ALL THIS
       HOUSE where we’re sittin. That’s what we need is a waiting on the holy ghost, power for
       service.

       William Marrion Branham
       36 There’s so many things that we could speak of here. I got a list wrote down that take me two
       hours to get through it, nearly, and Scriptures to back this up, like if you want some of them here
       to back it up. Like First John 5:7, shows the natural and the spiritual birth, and so forth, “water,
       Blood, and Spirit.” And three in Heaven, “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,” these three are one.
       
       64
       There are three that agree in earth, they’re not one, but they agree in one, in the earth, that’s
       “water, Blood, and Spirit.” See, “water, Blood, and Spirit,” like the natural birth type it. 37 So if
       a man sets on the thought of “just justification is all you have to have,” he’s wrong, wrong. He’s
       got to be wrong. And then if the church who believes like the many of the Pentecostals, that the
       Holy Ghost is it, “that’s all, just repent and get the Holy Ghost,” that’s still wrong, because
       you’ve got to get sanctification in there to cleanse it before the Holy Ghost comes in. If you
       don’t, you leave out the Blood. See? And the new Birth, as people talks that the baptism of the
       Holy Ghost is the new Birth. Now, that’s wrong. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is different
       from the new Birth. The new Birth is when you’re born again. But the Holy Ghost is when
       power comes into that Birth for service. That’s exact. See? The Holy Ghost is…baptized into
       the Holy Ghost. 38 The new Birth, you have the new Birth by being believing on the Lord
       Jesus Christ. See? By having faith and accepting Him as your Saviour, that’s Birth, see,
       because you’ve passed from death unto Life. Now, if you want to back that up, take Saint John
       5:24, “He that heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.” See,
       he’s got Life because he believes. And that same group had to go to Pentecost to be baptized
       with the Holy Ghost. Exact. 39 Holy Ghost is power for service. So when talk about you got to
       be born again, and applying that to the Holy Ghost, many of the Methodists and so forth are
       wrong there. It cannot. It just won’t cope through the Scripture here. You get the thing
       sideways. It’s got to take it the way the Scripture’s got it placed out here. See? And the Holy
       Spirit is a… “You shall receive the new Birth after this”? What? No. “You shall receive power,”
       Acts 1:8, “after this the Holy Ghost is come upon you.” See? And they had already believed to
       Eternal Life, and so forth, but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power. “YOU SHALL BE
       WITNESSES UNTO ME AFTER THE HOLY GHOST IS COME UPON YOU,” BECAUSE
       THE HOLY GHOST IS A WITNESS OF THE RESURRECTION, SHOWING THAT YOU
       HAVE BECOME AN ADULT IN CHRIST. 40 Now, the natural. All things spiritual, all
       happenings and so forth tap, or type the supernatural, or the—the natural is a type of the
       supernatural.
        They waited up there brother, until they heard a rushing, like a prophet heard here. The angels
       come through there and begin to wave their wings a little bit, heavenly wings, begin to wave
       their wings. AND THEY HEARD A RUSHING SOUND, WHAT WAS THAT RUSHING
       SOUND IT WAS THE COMMISSION GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PREACH
       THIS GOSPEL. HEAL THE SICK AND HEAL THE LEPERS RAISE THE DEAD OPEN THE
       BLINDED EYES, THE WORKS THAT I DO I GIVE YOU ALSO. That’s what we need, is a
       rushing mighty wind to bring the commission. THEY AIN’T GOT NO COMMISSION
       TODAY! God never said, go into all the world and explain brother Branham, God never said go
       into all the world and explain the message. Go ye into all the world and tell them the good news
       that I have come with my kingdom. Cast out devils and heal the sick and raise the dead and
       prove that the kingdom of God is in you. We prove everything else is in us, but the kingdom
       today.
        THE MORE TIME GOES ON THE MORE WE PROVE THAT WE DON’T HAVE IT
       DOWN ON THE INSIDE! WHAT WE NEED IS A KILLIN, WE NEED TO HAVE GOD
       KILL US AND GRIND OUT ALL THIS OLE STRIFE AND HATEFULNESS AND
       JEALOUSY AND STUBBORNNESS that’s down inside of us. BUT THE VERY SPIRIT OF
       THIS HOUR IS THAT PEOPLE WON’T REPENT! DON’T YOU KNOW THAT WE’RE
       
       65
       BOUND FOR HELL UNLESS WE REPENT. UNLESS THERE’S A HEARTFELT
       REPENTANCE DOWN ON THE INSIDE. BUT GOD TOLD THE PROPHET THAT THEY
       WON’T REPENT, BUT GO ANYHOW. Thank about it, Oh God!

       54-0512 - The Seven Church Ages
       William Marrion Branham
       174 Excuse us, strangers, I’m giving the church a little Gospel spanking now. Notice, that’s
       right. It’s exactly what you need. 175 “Oh,” you say, “we got It.” And get up there and beat the
       piano as hard as it can go, and a bunch of drums, and run up and down the floor, and go out and
       fuss with your neighbor. Have you got anything? Uh-huh. No, sir. The only thing we got is a
       lukewarm. As long as the music is running, we’re running. When the music stops, we stop.
       Brother, don’t call the other fellow something; let’s look around your own door, first. Amen. 176
       I tell you, we need an old-fashion revival like we used to have down in the country, when they
       lay on their face all night long. Not to carry on, but when real godly sorrow; and not go back
       to the altar and stay, but go out and make it right with the neighbors they had made it wrong
       with, and get straightened up. You know that’s right. Scorching, but, brother, it’ll help you.
       That’s right. You’ve got to know that, my friend. Yes, sir. 177 A lukewarm, that’s a horrible
       condition for the church to be in. You don’t watch, the Branham Tabernacle is about in that
       same sway. Listen, you know these things. It’s been taught, year after year, after year, after
       year, over this platform, warning you of these things coming. When, the Bible said there would
       be a time they’d go from the east to the west, and north and south, trying to find the true Word
       of God, and fail to find It. You better get anchored, where you know where you’re standing.
       178 But when a man is once borned again; not emotionally worked up, not some enthusiasm, not
       by putting his name on a church book, not by joining the biggest church in the city. But when
       he’s actually cried through, and begged, with tears in his eyes, until God has forgive his sins,
       cleansed his soul up from a life of sin, and filled him with the Holy Spirit; with such love, and
       godly, till he takes them old tire tools back, he stole from the neighbors, and goes and makes
       up to these things, and lives godly before men. We’ll never have a revival in this country till we
       have that. [Brother Branham knocked on the pulpit four times—Ed.] 179 Judgment begins at the
       house of God, by the Word of God. Amen. Not a textbook, but the Bible. Not what some church
       teaches in their theology, but what God says. THEN YOU’LL HAVE A REVIVAL WHERE
       GREAT POWERS, AND WONDERS, AND SIGNS, AND MIRACLES, AND EVERYTHING
       ELSE, WILL TAKE PLACE. 180 We’re lukewarm. Because we’re lukewarm in this age, God
       said, “I’ll spue you from My mouth.” This church age will be rejected. There’ll be a remnant
       out of it, that’ll be saved. So better mark yourself, right good, to find out if you’re in that
       remnant now. We’ll get into it in a minute, if God willing. Just notice now.

       56-0527 - At Kadesh-Barnea
       William Marrion Branham
       121 The Kadesh-barnea come to the place where there had to be a judgment. And Moses chose
       twelve, one out of each tribe, and he sent them over to spy out the land. 122 When they come
       back, I wish you would notice what a report! “Oh,” they said, “it’s a goodly land. Oh, it’s a
       
       66
       wonderful land. It’s flowing with milk and honey.” 123 “But,” ten of them said, “we can’t take
       it. We can’t take it. Oh,” said, “we met the—the Amorites, the Midianites, and—and the
       Canaanites, and all that. Why, we looked like grasshoppers, aside of them. They are great big
       fellows. And their cities are all walled in, and there’s no way for us to ever get in. Oh, our hearts
       are fainting within us. We can’t take it.” And, the popular vote of the people, the people
       received it. 124 But there stood two there, one named Caleb, and one named Joshua, who
       brought back a cluster of grapes, that two men had to pack it. Caleb said, “Quieten yourselves,
       before the prophet. Quieten yourself.” [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit four times—
       Ed.] He said, “We are well able to take it. Let’s go get it, immediately!” 125 WHAT WE
       NEED IN THIS HOUR IS A MAN TO CHALLENGE THE PROMISE OF GOD BEFORE
       THE PEOPLE. GOD PROMISED THE POURING OUT OF THE PENTECOSTAL
       BLESSING IN THE LAST DAYS, I MEAN A REAL PENTECOSTAL POUR OUT, AND
       IT’S TIME FOR IT TO COME. Another Kadesh-barnea has arrived. Yes, sir. 126 They said,
       “We can well do it. Sure, we can do it.” What was it? Those cowardly church members was
       looking to what they could see with their eyes, but Caleb and Joshua was looking to God’s
       promise. I don’t care how much opposition they had, how big the giants looked, how big the
       fences looked, they were looking to God’s promise. 127 AND EVERY A MAN AND WOMAN
       TONIGHT, THAT WANTS TO GO ON WITH GOD, DON’T PAY ANY ATTENTION WHAT
       THE WORLD SAYS, WHETHER WE CAN OR WHETHER WE CAN’T; GOD PROMISED
       IT, AND THAT SETTLES IT. “GOD SAID SO!” I like that. When God says so, that settles it
       forever. 128 I tell you, tonight. We’ve had a whole lot of false pretense. We’ve had a lot of
       make-up belief. We’ve had a lot of stuff that went on for a show. CERTAINLY. THE DEVIL
       ALWAYS THROWS HIS FORERUNNERS AT YOU, AS A COUNTERFEIT TO SCARE
       THE PEOPLE. WE’VE HAD A FALSE PENTECOST. WE’VE HAD A FALSE RAIN.
       WE’VE HAD A FALSE THIS AND THAT. 129 But in the midst of every bit of it, there’s a
       genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit. There’s a genuine pentecostal blessing, again. There’s a
       genuine Divine healing. There’s a genuine Spirit. There’s a genuine people. And it’s time for
       the march. That’s right. 130 THE PEOPLE, AT THE HOUR OF DECISION NOW! YOU’VE
       GOT TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND. THIS CHURCH HAS GOT TO MAKE UP ITS MIND.
       EVERY MAN COMES TO A PLACE WHERE THERE’S A CRUCIAL HOUR. THERE WAS
       A CRUCIAL TIME COME WHERE YOU HAD TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND. A
       JUDGMENT SEAT, YOU WAS AT. You had to say, “I am guilty,” or, “I am not guilty.” When
       you’re standing before the judge, you’ve got to make up your mind. 131 AND, TONIGHT,
       THE BRANHAM TABERNACLE HAS GOT TO MAKE UP ITS MIND. WE’RE EITHER
       GOING TO GO ON OR GO BACK. THAT’S RIGHT. YOU’RE GOING BACK TO GARLIC
       AND—AND LEEK, AND STUFF OF EGYPT, OR YOU’RE GOING ON TO ANGELS’
       FOOD, TO THE PROMISED LAND WHERE GOD MADE A PROMISE. WE’RE GOING
       ON TO AN OLD-FASHION, HOLY GHOST REVIVAL; OR YOU’LL BE WISH-WASHY,
       PACKING AROUND, AND PECKING LIKE A ROBIN ON AN APPLE, UNTIL THE DAY
       YOU DIE. You’ve got to make your decision. You can’t go on. “Why halt ye between two
       opinions?” said Elijah. “God be God, serve Him. If He’s not God, then don’t serve Him.” 132
       If the real experience of God is what takes the sin out of a man’s heart, and not belonging to a
       church, or belonging to a clan, or belonging to an organization, which I have nothing to say
       against. Those things are all right. If…

       61-1112 - A True Sign That's Overlooked
       William Marrion Branham
       It’s because that people won’t read the Word, and they won’t pray. So, God is sovereign, and
       He sends His prophet to be a sign. The people won’t read. They don’t care to read. And they
       won’t pray, because they’re too…got other things to do. They can’t take time to pray. And the
       Bible is boresome to them. It hasn’t got enough action for these modern days, or any days.
        But he heard a rushin', getting ready to go now, somethings getting ready to happen.
       Ezekiel 3:12-Reference quote:
       12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed
       be the glory of the Lord from his place.
        There ain’t nothing gonna happen in the bride, until you hear that rushin'! HOW MANY
       HERE THIS MORNING WANT TO HEAR THAT RUSHIN'? (Amen) That’s the only thing
       that’ll do the job, is another sound from heaven, we need power for service, power of the Holy
       Ghost.
       Acts 2:1-6-Reference quote:
       1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
       2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all
       the house where they were sitting.
       3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
       4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the
       Spirit gave them utterance.
       5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
       6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded,
       because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
        We need to be filled with salt. Jesus said if the salt has lost its savor what good is it, throw it
       out. What is the salt? THE SALT IS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. It’s the salt in
       the stew that makes it taste good. If it ain’t got no salt in it, you spit it out of your mouth. AND
       GOD IS GONNA SPEW EVERYTHING OUT OF HIS MOUTH THAT DOESN’T HAVE
       THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THAT’S GOD SALT, WE NEED MORE SALT.
       Take the salt out of it, it ain’t worth nothing. Yes sir!
       Matthew 5:12-14-Reference quote:
       12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they
       the prophets which were before you.
       13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it
       is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
       
       68
       14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
        But he heard a rushin, he’s getting ready to be commissioned now. What happen when he
       heard the rushin? Then the spirit lifted him up.
       Ezekiel 3:12-Reference quote:
       12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed
       be the glory of the Lord from his place.
        OH GOD, WHEN THEY HEARD A RUSHIN ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST THE
       SPIRIT OF GOD LIFTED THEM UP IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST JESUS. Amen!
        The spirit lifted him up and took him away. Oh, don’t that burn in my soul. The spirit lifted
       him up, what are you talking about? The power of God!
        Did you know speakin in tongues and all them things, that ain’t the power of God! That’s the
       blessing of the holy spirit. The power of God is Power, brother! Did you ever see anything that
       would lift up a great big part of the building up, using a Crane? There’s power in that Crane.
       They don’t put a little tiny V8 motor down on it, putt, putt, putt. Man, they put some horse power
       down in there. A big ole hook and a big ole chain picking up tons and tons and sit it way up there
       and stories high up there. Takes power, to lift that up there.

       62-1124E - All Things
       William Marrion Branham
       They say, “Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.” That’s right. BUT WE
       MADE A TRADITION OUT OF IT. THEY STINK BEFORE HIM. You see the reason? The
       worshipper coming, doing it, he did it only as a form. And we are guilty of doing the same
       thing. We make a form out of it, yet it’s the commandment of God. 35 Like, just recently when
       our movements got started, and God begin to adding something to them, and we went off with it,
       made a tradition out of it, and it lost its power. Instead of bringing brotherhood together, it
       separated brotherhood. You do it sometimes just for a tradition, without the sincerity of it.
       You’ve got to enter the feast of God with sincerity. No real sincerity, no real sorrow for sin…
       People come up to the altar, and many of them take a lot of music, a little dancing, clapping of
       hands, maybe run up and down the aisle, and maybe just speak with tongues. Now, I believe in
       speaking in tongues. I believe in running up and down the aisles; I believe in the clapping of
       hands. BUT IF THERE ISN’T SOME FEELING BEHIND THERE, IF THERE’S SOME
       SINCERITY THAT JESUS CHRIST HAS CLEANSED YOU… Not doing it because Miss
       Jones did it, but doing it because there’s something in you pulsating, the sorrow for your sins,
       and the joy of the victory that you share in the resurrection of your sacrifice, the evidence of
       your eternal security. How can you not be sincere in that? 36 I believe a man can shout and not
       be saved. I believe he can run and not be saved. I believe he can speak in tongues and not be
       saved. I BELIEVE HE CAN DO ANY OF THESE THINGS AND NOT BE SAVED. But you
       can’t class everybody that does that now. The other side says, “There’s nothing to any of it.”
       BUT THERE’S SOMEBODY SINCERE IN THAT. THERE’S SOMEBODY GOT THE
       GENUINE RESULTS, BECAUSE HE ENTERED IT SINCERELY UPON THE BASIS OF
       HIS FAITH IN THE SHED BLOOD. AND HE GOT THE RIGHT THINGS. But the other
       
       69
       one’s only mocking. AND THERE’S TOO MUCH MOCKING GOING ON, TOO MUCH
       IMPERSONATION, CARNAL IMPERSONATIONS, CARNAL COMPARISONS. 37 If you’d
       come seeking the Holy Spirit, and let Him, the faith that you’ve got in Him add to that virtue,
       and to that brotherly kindness (Second Peter 1:7), until you’re built in the full stature of
       Christ, then the last thing is love, which God, the Holy Spirit, seals you to your destination.
       You can’t impersonate. You can impersonate it, but as I said last night, it’s just like a—a
       blackbird putting peacock feathers in his wings and saying, “See, I’m a peacock.” He just
       added them, pushed them in. If there’s something on the inside of him, made him push them
       out, he’d actually be a peacock. Certainly. But some people are trying to do something to look
       like somebody else, or impersonate somebody else, because they thought they did it. And you
       see what it does? It brings us back into a ritual and form again. IT’S THE BLOOD, THE
       LIFE THAT ELECTRIFIES AND SANCTIFIES YOUR LIFE. That’s right. 38 Isaiah spilled
       it out to them and said, “God said that He’s hiding His face from your prayers. You’ve got your
       ritualistic form, yet it’s the truth. You’re doing what He told you, but you’re not doing it in
       sincerity. And you squall out day and night, but God said, ‘Your sacrifice is a stink to me, and I
       will not receive it any more. And when you pray under such conditions, I’ll hide My face from
       you.’” Oh, God. If people would think of that, it would start a Pentecost. God said, “Though
       you be correctly in the Word…” But if you don’t do it with love and sincerity, God said He
       would hide His face, and wouldn’t hear your prayers. See? That’s the way. 39 Oh, you said that
       “You’re taking under the Old Testament, Brother Branham.” All right. Let’s take the New
       Testament, Second Timothy 3. THE HOLY SPIRIT WARNED US THAT IN THE LAST DAYS
       THAT THE CHURCH WOULD GET AWAY FROM THE SINCERITY AND THE FAITH.
       THEY’D HAVE A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT WOULD DENY THE POWER THAT
       WENT WITH THE RIGHT THING, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT DENYING
       THE POWER THEREOF. YES, SIR. GOD HATES A POWERLESS RELIGION. AND ANY
       RELIGION TODAY THAT HASN’T GOT CHRIST IN IT, IS POWERLESS. BUT ANY
       RELIGION THAT CHRIST IN IS UNDER HIS OWN BLOOD, AND IT’S GOT POWER IN
       IT. You say God hates a religion without power? He said, “Your solemn feasts is a stink.” I
       guess He does hate it. He said, “It—it makes Me sick.” And remember, He told this rich
       Laodicean church that “Because you’re lukewarm (in other words, you make Me sick), I’ll
       spue you out of My mouth.” And we’ve come to that age. God, send us an Isaiah to chop the
       thing to pieces, lay it out before the people: cry out; spare not. You think he’d be accepted?
       Certainly not. But he’d cry just the same. Solemn feasts, they’re a stink. God hates powerless
       religion. It’s got to have power in it. It’s got to have sincerity. Sincerity brings power. Sincerity
       brings real worship, not forms, but genuine power worship to know that you’ve passed from
       death unto Life. 40 God wants to perform His Word by His power. And when the church
       denies His power, how can He perform and vindicate His Word? When the church explains it
       away and says it’s for some other day, and something, how can God, Who wants to—to fulfill
       His Word, and perform His Word among the people… And the people deny that He does it. Yet,
       they go through all the rituals. See? Here’s what’s happened. God wants to perform by the Holy
       Ghost, and vindicate His Word; and the church wants to perform. They have to deny the Holy
       Ghost. They want to perform to make a big organization, and what else? To bring membership,
       no matter what you have to baptize sinners, drunkards, bootleggers, anything else, and take them
       into the body of the church. No wonder Revelation 17 said this old prostitute woman, that had a
       bunch of daughters, that she was full of names, or blasphemous names. Churches, or daughtercalling the names of her daughters… People who join churches and call that “got salvation,”
       
       70
       it’s a blasphemy. Now, I know the King James here said, “names of blasphemy,” but you look
       in the Diaglott, and see if it is. It says, “Blasphemous names.” There’s quite a difference. She
       is full of those. She’s got nine hundred and something different organizations in her, plenty of
       blasphemous names. Got away, by some man-made tradition got away from the true worship,
       power out of the… 41 Oh, you say, “I went down there, and there’s a lot of power. Brother,
       the whole floor was dancing in the Spirit,” AND NOT ENOUGH FAITH TO HEAL A
       TOOTHACHE. YOU CALL THAT POWER? THAT’S NOT POWER. THAT’S BLESSINGS.
       THERE’S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLESSINGS AND POWER. God makes
       His blessings upon the righteous and unrighteous. The sun shines and… See? WE GOT TO GET
       BACK TO TRUTH, FRIENDS. WE GOT TO COME BACK TO WHAT GOD MEANS. What
       He says, He means. See? And He refused their… Once hid His face from their prayers…
       
        And Ezekiel was lifted up off the earth, a human being BY THE POWER OF GOD WAS
       LIFTED BODILY UP OFF THE EARTH. WHAT KIND OF POWER DO YOU THINK IT
       WAS THAT PICKED UP THAT LITTLE BROTHER CALLED PHILIP? Picked him up
       straight in the air and carried him away about sixty miles and SET HIM DOWN FILLED WITH
       THE HOLY GHOST. My God he turned the city upside down, by the power of God he lifted
       him up. I imagine the back of his neck and back was numb for days. But I bet he had the victory,
       don’t you? God that’s why we need to be lifted up. We need to hear a sound from heaven so it’ll
       lift us up. I love that, he lifted him up, by the power of God he lifted him up.
       Acts 8:35-40-Reference quote:
       35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him
       Jesus.
       36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See,
       here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
       37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and
       said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
       38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both
       Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
       39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip,
       that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
       40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he
       came to Cæsarea.
        Did you know that the prophet of God (William Branham) was lifted up, bodily up off the
       earth into the presence of them angels? What kind of power do you think it is that would pick
       your feet off the earth and pick your body and hang it up there a while? I imagine you’d live the
       life when he sat you back down.
        What we need is a burning out, we need licks of fire, we need tongues of fire to sit upon us
       and burn out all this stuff in us, that’s contrary to the Holy Ghost. And lift us up into heavenly
       places and anoint us and send us out with the word of the Lord. My God we need it. Gods gonna
       commission this church one of these days. He’s gonna descend from heaven one of these days.
       I’m willing to wait on it, aren’t you? (Amen) WAIT UNTIL, IF ITS TEN DAYS, TWENTY

       53-1130 - Has The Lord Spoken Only To Moses?
       William Marrion Branham
       But now in the day we can’t expect the Gospel of Christ to be popular. Now, the—the Gospel—
       this is not the Gospel. This is a part of the Gospel. The—Paul said the word—the Gospel come
       not in Word only, but through power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost. Is that right? The
       Gospel is not the Word only. The Word’s just a dead letter. It’s got to take the—the letter
       quickened and made alive and brought to pass what the letter says it’ll do. That’s the Gospel. 5
       Jesus said, “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to ever nation.” Now, listen to see
       whether that’s right or not. Preach the Gospel to ever nation. That’s the United States and to all
       the world, and “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall
       be damned; and these signs shall follow them that believe: In My Name they’ll cast out devils,
       speak with new tongues, take up serpents, drink deadly things, or lay their hands on the sick,
       shall not harm them.” Now, in order… He didn’t say go teach the Word. He said, “Go preach
       the Gospel.” He never did commission, “Go teach the Word.” “Go preach the Gospel.” And
       the—THE WORD IS THE BEGINNING OR THE FORERUNNER of the Gospel. The Word
       goes out, and the Gospel of the power of the demonstration of God FOLLOWS THE WORD—
       MAKES THE WORD MANIFEST. That is the Gospel. And in order if man could preach the
       Gospel, the last Word… 6 Maybe there would be someone who wouldn’t believe in Divine
       healing. I wonder what you’d think of this: the first commission that Jesus gave the Church was
       to heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the leper, cast out devils, freely as you receive, freely
       give. The first commission was ever give to the apostles—to the Church. Not only the apostles.
       You said, “That was just the apostles.” I beg your pardon. There’s seventy of them, not just
       apostles. Someone said the other day, “That the power only come to apostles.” It was give to
       whosoever will, he that believeth, not to the apostles. There was seventy sent that wasn’t
       apostles. Philip was not apostle, and he went down to Samaria, and cast out devils, and healed
       the lunatics, and had joy and shouting and screaming and going on to the city down there, and
       he wasn’t apostle. He was a deacon. He wasn’t even a preacher, and he had signs following his
       ministry. To demonstrate the power of God is preaching the Gospel. 7 Now, go ye into all the
       world and demonstrate the power of the Gospel. The first words that He spoke to His disciples,
       the first commission was to heal the sick and cast out devils. The last word that fell from Jesus
       Christ’s lips according to this Bible was to heal the sick, Mark 16. While He was being taken up,
       He said, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to ever creature. He that believeth
       (not you all), he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be
       damned. And (‘and’ is a conjunction) and these signs shall follow (not you) them that believe;
       In My Name they shall cast out devils; speak with new tongues; take up serpents; drink deadly
       thing; lay hands on the sick… they shall recover.” And that was the last Words that Jesus said
       on this earth. The last Words that mortals ever heard that fell from His lips in the ascension
       
       72
       He commissioned them to heal the sick and cast out devils. That’s right. They said that would
       be the sign that the Gospel was being preached. 8 Now, I want to lay it before you, friends.

       62-0128A - A Paradox
       William Marrion Branham
       76 It was a paradox when He went to choose His church, that He chose fishermen instead of
       priests. That’s contrary to nature. Look like He’d had a great big church, with all bunch of
       ministers all shined up and polished up, and knows their theology, and got all their Ph.D’s, and
       everything. That’s where He come to. But He just bypassed the whole bunch, went down and
       got some fishermen that couldn’t even sign their own name. The Bible said that Peter and
       John was ignorant and unlearned. That’s who He got for His church. That’s a paradox.
       Certainly. Yes, sir. He chose fishermen, instead of men—instead of priests. 77 Now, we find
       out that on the day of Pentecost… It’s strange that He chose a bunch of unlearned people,
       and sent them up there with a commission at Pentecost—not to go to some seminary, BUT TO
       WAIT UNTIL THEY WAS ENDUED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH. If that man Peter,
       and John and them, wanted to preach and they were ignorant and unlearned, look like He’d
       said, “Boys, there’s a fine school right over here. You go till you learn your ABC’s. Then after
       you do that, you’ll take your grammar school. Get it all, that through. Then you’ll take four
       years of high school, then four years of college, and then about four or five years of Bible
       School. THEN YOU CAN GO OUT.” But He said, “WAIT IN THE CITY OF JERUSALEM,
       for I’m going to send the promise of the Father upon you. And THEN you’ll be witnesses of
       Me (Luke 24:49), witnesses of Me in Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and to the uttermost parts
       of the earth.” That’s still His requirement.

       62-0318 - The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed
       William Marrion Branham
       414 Now, here is what I’m trying to say to you. The law of reproduction, bring forth of its kind,
       Genesis 1:11. These last days, true Church-Bride comes to the Headstone, will be the super
       Church, a super Race, as the…nears the great Headstone. They will be much like, so much
       like Him, even they will be in His very image, in the order to be united with Him. They will be
       One. They will be the very manifestation of the Word of the living God. Denominations can
       never produce This. This will be…They will produce their creeds and dogmas, mixed with the
       Word, and—and brings a hybrid product. 415 The first son was spoken Seed-Word of God. He
       was given a bride. (I’m just reviewing. The Spirit now is picking up what I said. See?) A bride,
       produ-…to produce himself. She fell. SEE, THAT’S WHAT…THE BRIDE WAS GIVEN, TO
       PRODUCE HIMSELF AGAIN, ANOTHER SON OF GOD. BUT SHE FELL, BY
       HYBREEDING, SEE. PRODUCE HIMSELF; BUT SHE FELL, CAUSED HIM TO DIE.
       416 The second Son, a spoken Seed-Word of God, was given a bride, like Adam. But before He
       could marry her, she had fallen, also. For she was put to a free moral agency, like Adam’s
       wife was, to believe God’s Word and live, or doubt It and die. And she did. 417 THEN FROM
       A LITTLE GROUP OF THE TRUE SEED OF THE WORD, GOD WILL PRESENT
       
       73
       CHRIST A BELOVED BRIDE, A VIRGIN, A VIRGIN OF HIS WORD. And through them,
       and by them, will be fulfilled all that has been promised for His Word in the Virgin who knows
       no man-made creeds or dogmas. 418 The Word of promise in Himself, like It was in Mary,
       God Himself made manifest. He will act Himself, by His Own Word of promise, so to fulfill all
       that has been written of Him, AS HE DID WHEN HE CAME FROM THE VIRGIN WOMB.
       TYPE OF THE SPIRIT WOMB NOW, SO WILL THE VIRGIN NOW, ACCEPTING HIS
       WORD, “BE IT UNTO ME AS THOU HAS SAID.” Though it was said by an Angel, while it
       yet was the written Word, Isaiah 9:6. 419 They will love Him, love His, and will have His
       potentials, for He is their Head. And they are His subjects, subject to His Head. Headship of
       Christ was His. 420 Notice what harmony! Jesus never did anything until seen of the Father,
       or, the Father showed Him first. Harmony between God and Christ, see, John 5:19. SO WILL
       THE BRIDE, AND HE SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE. HE SHOWS HER, AND SHE
       RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT. NOTHING CAN HARM HER, NOT EVEN
       DEATH. FOR IF THE SEED BE PLANTED, THE WATER WILL RAISE IT UP AGAIN.
       (Amen. Then I got a great big “Hallelujah!”) Here is the secret. The Word is in the Bride, and
       the mind of Christ, to know what He wants done with the Word. And She does it in His Name.
       She has THUS SAITH THE LORD. Then It is germitized, so the Holy Spirit waters It until It
       is grown and serves Its purpose. 421 They do only His will. (Amen. I’ll believe that.) No one
       can persuade them different. They have THUS SAITH THE LORD or they keep still. Then
       they will do the works of God, for It is Himself in them continuing His Word to fulfill, as He
       did complete in His days. ALL THINGS, WHEN HE WAS HERE, HE DID NOT
       COMPLETE ALL WHEN HE WAS HERE, FOR IT WAS NOT TIME YET. 422 Now let us
       stand like Joshua and Caleb. (Now watch close. This is going to have a spiritual background.)
       Now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb, as we see the promised Land coming in sight. It’s
       nearing the time to be given. Joshua, in Hebrew, means Saviour, and represents the promised
       end-time leader to take the Church over. Caleb represents the true believer who stayed with
       Joshua. God started Israel as a virgin with His Word. But they wanted something different. So
       did the last-day church. 423 NOTICE HOW GOD DID NOT MOVE ISRAEL UNTIL HIS
       OWN APPOINTED TIME. (Now listen. This is going to mean something.) JOSHUA WAITED
       FOR THAT TIME. No how matter, how much people might have said, “God gave us the land,
       the promise. Let us go now and take it.” They might have said, “Joshua, you lost your
       commission. You’re all washed up. Why are you not doing something? You used to do, know
       THUS SAITH THE LORD in a moment, and what was the will of God.” BUT THIS WISE,
       GOD-SENT PROPHET KNEW THE PROMISE OF GOD, BUT ALSO KNEW TO WAIT
       FOR THAT PROMISE, A CLEAR-CUT DECISION FROM GOD FOR HIS TIME. (See
       these parables. Now watch.) AND WHEN THE TIME COME, GOD GAVE IT TO JOSHUA,
       WHO HAD STAYED WITH HIM, BY THE WORD, FOR HE COULD NOT TRUST
       OTHERS. HE COULD TRUST HIM. SO WILL IT REPEAT.
        Thank God for Peter, thank God for the keys. You know the Bible said that Jesus Christ
       descended up out of hell and he had the keys of death hell and the grave with him. BUT THERE
       WAS ON KEY THAT HE DIDN’T HAVE, HE’D ALREADY GAVE IT AWAY. I SAID,
       BEFORE THE RESURRECTION EVER SET IN, HE ALREADY HAD ONE KEY THAT HE
       GAVE IT AWAY. AND HE GAVE IT AWAY TO A MAN THAT HAD A REVELATION OF
       THE COMING OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND HE UNLOCKED ANOTHER SOUND FROM
       
       74
       HEAVEN LIKE A RUSHIN MIGHTY WIND, HALLELUJAH AND IT FILLED ALL OF
       THEM. Rattle your keys Peter! Rattle them and let them know that their here. THERE IS A
       MAN HERE THAT CAN TURN ON THE LIGHTS! WHEN HE GETS READY TO TURN
       THEM ON. HE’S GOD! Amen!
        Oh, we need a killin and a dyin out is what we need, we need A PURGIN'. LET ME SAY IT,
       IF THE MULTITUDE THAT GOES THROUGH THE TRIBULATION, THEY GET A
       PURGING AND IF THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS GONNA ESCAPE THAT PURGIN THEIR
       GONNA HAVE TO PURGE THEIR SOULS WITH PRAYERS AND CRYINGS TO GOD. In
       a genuine heartfelt repentance to God or miss the rushin or miss the licks of fire, miss the filling
       of the holy ghost. Thank God for a time that we can purge our souls and cry out to God. When
       WE SEE SOMETHING WRONG IN OUR LIFE, THAT’S THE TIME TO GET IT OUT AND
       REPENT. Don’t wait till we get way down the road. Get it out, that’s what’s hindering the Lord
       today. We’re full of self, we all are. There ain’t nobody better shape than the other. You got a
       certain thing to overcome and brother so and so got another. This sister got this to overcome and
       that sisters got that to overcome. What’s the difference? Everybody’s got something to
       overcome. But the thing that it is TO LAY ASIDE OF EVERY WEIGHT AND SIN THAT SO
       EASILY BESETS YOU! Run that race and hear that rushin'.
       Hebrews 12:1-8-Reference quote:
       1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay
       aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the
       race that is set before us,
       2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before
       him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of
       God.
       3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be
       wearied and faint in your minds.
       4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
       5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son,
       despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
       6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
       7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the
       father chasteneth not?
       8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not

       80 That’s what’s the matter today. We’ve drafted in our ideas, drafted in our denominations, but
       if that tree ever puts forth another fruit vine, itself, it’ll be like the original ones that went into it.
       Hallelujah! OH, CHURCH WILL BLEND TOGETHER, BUT WE NEED THE POWER OF
       THE ORIGINAL. WE NEED THE HOLY GHOST, THE POWER OF THE
       RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST. That’s what He told us to do. 81 “I am the Vine, ye
       are the branches.” If a grapevine puts forth a shoot, and it comes out with pretty blue grapes, the
       
       75
       next vine it brings out will have pretty blue grapes on it. If the first Vine come out, and they fell
       under the impact of the Holy Spirit, and they did great miracles, and signs, and sealed their
       testimony to a world…Even many of them with their own testimony, they, with their blood, they
       sealed their testimony. They went through all kinds of perils and everything to bring the Gospel.
       They suffered; they were beaten; they were punished. “Must we be carried home to Heaven, on a
       flowery bed of ease, while others fought to win the prize, and sailed through bloody seas?”
       WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO DO? “I must fight if I must reign. Increase my courage, Lord.”
       Certainly. We need a… 82 We don’t need a new denomination. We don’t need a new church
       building. WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS AN OLD-TIME BACKWOODS, SKY-BLUE, SINKILLING PENTECOSTAL REVIVAL, THAT WAS BORNED AT PENTECOST AND IS
       BACK INTO THE CHURCH AGAIN, THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST AGAIN, TO
       BRING JESUS ON THE SCENE. 83 THE GOD OF HISTORY ALWAYS RISES ON THE
       SCENE IN A CRUCIAL MOMENT. WE NEED IT. THAT’S WHAT’S THE MATTER
       WITH OUR CHURCH TODAY. We’re getting too far back. We’re falling into the fashions of
       the world. And gradually, year by year, it begins to die a little and wither away. 84 It’s pruning
       time pretty soon. God will cut it back as sure as I’m standing in this pulpit. God will cut her back
       to make her bear fruit. He will cut the works of the world out of it one of these days. Such a
       disgrace, the way the church has carried on under the name of religion. 85 And we find out,
       when Jesus left, death set in. When Jesus leaves our church, the power of the Holy Spirit leaves
       our church, it begins to dwindle and—and die. And after while there’s nothing no more to it.
       Now, when Jesus left, death set in. Oh, what a sad time it was. 86 And notice, they wondered
       around, and they sent for Jesus, but He didn’t come. They sent for Him again, and He didn’t
       come, but He knowed what He was going to do. He knows tonight, what He’s going to do. IT’S
       NOT LOST WITH HIM: HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE’S FIXING TO DO. HE’S
       GOING TO RAISE A PEOPLE UP, JUST AS CERTAIN AS I’M STANDING IN THIS
       PULPIT. HE WILL RAISE A PEOPLE FOR HIS NAME’S SAKE OUT OF THE GENTILE
       GENERATION. HE WILL DO IT. 87 It’s the Jews’ time’s right at hand now, and of the
       Gentiles are ending out, because they just went on out. They’re rejecting Christ; they’re
       rejecting their signs; they’re rejecting everything that’s called godly, and brand it as some kind
       of telepathy or devil power and do…THEY’RE BLASPHEMING THE HOLY GHOST AND
       SEALING THEMSELVES AWAY FROM GOD. AND GOD WILL TAKE THAT
       MINORITY, AFTER WHILE, AND RAISE IT UP INTO A POWERFUL CHURCH, and
       then turn the Spirit to the Jews, and take the Gentile Church home. Exactly right. She’s in the
       making now. Well, we’re at the end time, nearly.
       
        Ezekiel heard that rushin, and the spirit lifted him up and he took him away. Oh, brother think
       about it now, you believe the book? There was natural man just like you and I. He looked around
       and saw the glory of God and then he went on and he ate the book and he heard a rushin sound
       of a mighty wind and it filled him and then it lifted him off the earth and, whew! (Bro. Lambert
       makes a whishing sound) And carried him away.
        Think about it! Oh God, help us to believe God for big great things. I tell ya when he gets
       ready to work who can hinder. You don’t have to help God out, he’s a powerful mighty God.
       And I believe he’s getting ready TO DISPLAY HIS POWER AMONG HIS PEOPLE. Sure, he
       is! We got to get ready and eat the book and get right.

        Notice here, that when the spirit of God picked him up, he commissioned him and the spirit of
       God picked him up he went in the bitterness of his spirit. His spirit was HOT and he went in
       bitterness. Why? Because the hand of the Lord was strong upon him.
       Ezekiel 3:12-14-Reference quote:
       12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed
       be the glory of the Lord from his place.
       13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the
       noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
       14 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit;
       but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.
        Now notice here he already ate what was written on the inside of the book and what was
       written on the outside of the book. And then when the spirit come upon him he turned that
       revelation in him into bitterness and made his spirit bitter. Now what’s he doin? He’s makin that
       prophet angry and mad before he gets to the people. How many see what I’m talkin about? That
       revelation turns that man’s spirit into bitterness. Why is he bitter? He’s bitter because of the
       spirit that is on him and the love of God in him for his word and that revelation and that
       anointing on him turns him into bitterness.

       3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll
       that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
       4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my
       words unto them.
       5 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the
       house of Israel;
       6 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not
       understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
       7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for

       every apostle. That was, “Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? Repent, every
       one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you
       shall receive this gift of THE HOLY GHOST, FOR IT’S A TOKEN, AMEN, THAT YOU’VE
       PASSED FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE.” There you are. When that Gen-…Jewish church faded
       out, the Gentiles taken it over, and that perversion like that; now she has come out, to get that
       remnant of the Gentile, for His Name’s sake, the Bride.

       116 And when we can display the Token of the Holy Spirit, shows that we have been accepted
       in Christ, and that is our Token that all that we have need of is already purchased by Him. We
       are identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 117 THE BLOOD, COVENANT
       BLOOD, IS NOT RECOGNIZED WITHOUT THE TOKEN. THE WORD ASSURES US OF
       THE PROMISE. The Token is the sign the purchase has been made for us. 118 FULL
       OBEDIENCE TO THE FULL WORD OF GOD ENTITLES US TO THE TOKEN. NO
       OTHER WAY IS THERE, THAT YOU COULD EVER BE ENTITLED TO THE TOKEN,
       
       78
       UNTIL YOU FULLY OBEY THE WORD. Not what somebody has put into It, and added to It;
       but what God said about It! 119 When He said, “You must be born again.” That don’t mean
       jump up-and-down at the altar; that don’t mean walk back there and shake hands with the
       pastor; that don’t mean all this foolishness that we’ve seen done; it don’t mean putting your
       name on a church book. It means death to your first being, and Life to the second being. It
       means that the Blood has been applied, and you’re identified by the Life of Jesus Christ. And
       if He be the Vine, and we be the branches, the Life that’s in the branch is in also from the
       Vine. It’ll bear the fruit. 120 If that first branch come forth, that branch out of that Vine, that
       wrote a book of Acts behind it; if that branch ever puts forth, a Vine puts forth another
       branch, they’ll write another book of Acts behind it, ’cause it’s the same Life. If a one of your
       grapevines out here brings forth blue grapes, if it puts forth another branch, it’ll bring forth blue
       grapes. 121 And I tell you, today, we got so many grafted vines into It, with denominations and
       creeds and things, and yet any citrus fruit grafted in can live, live in that Vine. But it’s bearing
       the wrong fruit. 122 WHAT WE NEED, TODAY, IS ANOTHER BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
       SPIRIT, AND HAVE THE REAL POWER OF GOD THAT IDENTIFIES THE WORKS
       THAT JESUS CHRIST PROMISED FOR THIS DAY, NOT SO MUCH AS THAT DAY. This
       day, the promise that He made here. That was what He promised there, He would pour out His
       Spirit. Now HE HAS PROMISED IT AGAIN IN THE LAST DAYS, AND WHAT HE
       WOULD DO.

       259 And then when he heard Pastor Moses speak, that day, he said, “But you’ve got to get
       beneath that blood, for God said, ‘The blood is a token.’ It’s a token! No matter how much you
       believed, how much you are circumcised; that’s a covenant God gave to Abraham, and so forth,
       that’s the covenant. But you’ve got to get beneath the blood, that’s a token, for He said, ‘When I
       see the blood, I’ll pass.’ Israelite, or any!” 260 That’s denomination or not denomination,
       either one, you must come beneath the Blood. Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal,
       undenomination, whatever you are, it’s for an individual. You’ve got to come beneath the
       Blood. Now just don’t talk about It; receive It! Hear me! Hear me! In the Name of the Lord,
       hear me! See? Got to come beneath the Blood! 261 He was not responsible for any persons
       from beneath the blood. GOD MADE IT CLEAR THAT ALL FROM UNDER THAT BLOOD
       WOULD PERISH. 262 MAY I USE HIS WORDS? ALL OUTSIDE OF CHRIST WILL
       PERISH. How do you get in Christ? First Corinthians 12, “By one Spirit!” 263 Not, “by one
       handshake, by one membership, by one denomination.” That’s what they’re trying to make it.
       They may do that. 264 “But by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body.” “If an angel from
       Heaven teaches anything else,” Paul said, “let him be cursed.” That’s the Message, come into
       Christ! 265 LOOK, ANY PERSONS OUTSIDE OF THE TOKEN, GOD WAS NOT
       RESPONSIBLE. AND GOD IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PERSON, BIG OR SMALL,
       POPULAR OR UNPOPULAR, RICH OR POOR, BOND OR FREE, MALE OR FEMALE;
       HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYBODY THAT’S FROM UNDER THE TOKEN
       COVENANT. He’s not responsible. 266 You say, “But, O Lord, I’ve did this. I cast out devils.
       Lord, I did this. I—I preached the Gospel.” 267 “Depart from Me, you that work iniquity. I
       
       79
       never even knew you.” He only recognizes the Token.
        See here it is, right here in Ezekiel. What was it? He was in love with the revelation, he loved
       the word of God, he loved people. But that revelation when the spirit hit it, the hand of the Lord
       stirred his spirit up and made his spirit bitter. Here’s this Lion coming now, here’s this Lion,
       what’s a Lion do? When he bares down on his victim, he just lets out a roar and a scream brother
       that scares everybody in the congregation. And he goes down through there just a rippin' and a
       teari' and everything.
        Oh friend, I hope you don’t think I’m beside myself. I know what I’m talkin about. You better
       get ready to meet the Lord!

       133 God is in His Word, for He is the Word. That’s exactly. “I have heard.” And faith cometh
       not by hearing the council, but the Word. Hearing the Word! 134 They seen this, and they
       knowed. She knowed it was the truth. She asked for mercy, watch, for both her and her family.
       She asked for her and her family, just like they did in Egypt. 135 NOTICE, THERE WAS
       GIVEN TO HER A TOKEN, A RED TOKEN. That the scarlet string that she let the people, the
       spies, down out of the window, was to be a token. God would not, destroying angel… GOD’S
       DESTROYING ANGEL WOULD NOT COME NEAR HER AS LONG AS SHE HAD THAT
       TOKEN. But, and what if she’d say, “Oh, I let them down. I done—done a good deed. So now to
       keep anybody from criticizing me, and seeing this scarlet rope hanging out here, I’ll pull the
       rope back up”? THEN THE…THE JUDGMENT ANGEL WOULD HAVE NEVER PASSED
       OVER HER HOUSE. SHE HAD TO HAVE THE TOKEN DISPLAYED. It had to remain
       there. 136 Hallelujah! Oh, it means “praise our God,” in these hours. Remember this. I’m not in
       here for a living. I’m not in here preaching for a living. No, sir. I can work for that, yet. I don’t
       do this for that. If I thought that there was any other way besides this right…Remember, this is I,
       I’ve got to meet God. It’s my soul. It’s got to be me. It’s not only me, but I’d have more
       condemnation. The Word of God is God. That’s God’s program that’s laying there, and that’s
       the Truth. 137 I believe that the scarlet thread had to be displayed, or the angel, destroying
       angel, would have never honored anything else but that token when it was displayed. THE
       MESSENGERS GAVE HER A TOKEN, AND SHE MUST KEEP IT DISPLAYED. 138
       Notice, Jericho had heard what God had done, but did nothing to take the warning. 139 The
       world today, it’s not shut up in a side somewhere, the whole world knows these things goes on.
       The whole world has known. The Episcopalians, the Catholic, the Lutheran, all the
       denominations know that there is a God that works in His Word in this day, and keeps His
       signs and wonders moving. It’s not just shut up in a corner. They heard It, but they did not
       want to receive It. They had. 140 His great Power and His signs had been played, displayed,
       but they didn’t want to receive It. Just the same as it was in Sodom, HIS GREAT SIGNS AND
       WONDERS HAD BEEN DISPLAYED THERE, BUT THEY DIDN’T WANT TO RECEIVE
       IT. SO THERE WASN’T NOTHING LEFT BUT JUDGMENT, WAS NEXT. THEY MUST
       BELIEVE THE WHOLE WORD, TO BE SAFE. But they thought they were safe, perhaps, in
       their great big organization of Jericho, their city. They thought that was good enough, but it
       
       80
       wasn’t so. 141 BUT ONE LITTLE HARLOT. THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME TAPE
       BOYS SLIPPED IN THERE AND PLAYED SOME OF THE TAPES. THE—THE
       PREDESTINATED SEED CAUGHT IT AND BELIEVED IT. So, anyhow, they got in there
       for a message. They had church that night in her house. She used her house for a church, to
       receive the message. 142 O God, let us open our hearts and receive the Message, that Jesus is
       alive tonight. He is right here among us. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Open up
       your house and let the Messenger, the Holy Ghost, come in and identify you by His Own
       Presence, the Token that’s upon you. Then you don’t have to take anybody else’s word for it,
       He is there to speak for Himself. And He is the Word. That’s right. It’s God’s Token, to
       identify His Ownself. 143 She used her house for the messengers. Then she got all the city,
       that would believe, under the same token. 144 AND THAT’S THE WAY THE CHURCH
       SHOULD BE DOING TODAY, GETTING EVERYTHING THAT WILL BELIEVE, UNDER
       THE TOKEN. THE TOKEN IS THE HOLY GHOST. JUST REMEMBER, THEY MUST
       GET UNDER THE HOLY GHOST. 145 AND WHEN GOD HAD DESTROYED HIS
       ANGELS…THE DESTROYING ANGEL COME THROUGH, AND WHEN THEY SEEN
       THE SIGN OF THE TOKEN, her house stood. The rest of Jericho fell down. But just the
       sounding of the trumpet, just think, and the whole walls fell down. They went straightway and
       utterly slayed everything there was in there, but all that was under that token was safe. Why?
       The messenger of God had come. They had told them the truth and they got under the token.
       Yes, sir. But many of them didn’t want to believe it. So if they didn’t want to believe it, they
       had to take the circumstances. 146 Same life that was in the token at Egypt, see, life, same thing
       like the life token in Egypt. 147 When they put the string down, that was the token. In that Gentile
       world, there was no blood applied for them yet, but they give a symbol of the red, of the token.
       So, when they saw the token; JOSHUA, A TYPE OF JESUS, WAS TRUE TO THE TOKEN
       AND SIGN THAT HIS MESSENGERS HAD PREACHED, WHEN JOSHUA GIVE
       ORDERS THAT NO ONE SHOULD WALK UP TO THAT HOUSE WHERE THAT TOKEN
       WAS (NO, SIR), BECAUSE NO ONE WAS TO BE KILLED UNDER THAT TOKEN. And
       Joshua really means “Jehovah Saviour,” same as Jesus does. And when HE SENT HIS
       MESSENGERS, JOSHUA, ANOTHER TYPE TO THE GENTILE WORLD, AND THE
       GENTILE, THAT LITTLE MINORITY THAT BELIEVED AND DISPLAYED THIS
       TOKEN, EVEN THE DESTROYING ANGEL RECOGNIZED THAT TOKEN. See? That’s
       the only thing He’ll recognize today.

       62-1007 - The Key To The Door
       William Marrion Branham
       53 “There’s not another name given under Heaven whereby you must be saved, only through
       the Name of Jesus Christ.” No church, no denomination, no creed, no doctrines of anything;
       only through Jesus’ Name. That is the—that is the Key. No wonder Peter could use one of them
       on the Day of Pentecost! They wanted to know how to get into that Door. He used the Key. And
       there’s only one Key, because there’s just one Door. “I am the Door.” And Peter had the Key
       to It. And he said, “Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for
       the remission of your sin, and you shall receive the treasures of God.” It’s the Key to the Door,
       and Jesus is the Door. There’s only one Door to healing, and Jesus is that Door. 54 There’s
       
       81
       only one Door to peace. Yeah. “My peace I give unto you.” He’s only one Door to genuine
       peace. You might think you got peace. You might accumulate enough money to buy your home,
       you might accumulate enough money to get your children clothes, have food to eat, but you
       might have accumulated enough popularity to be popular amongst people. But when you slip off
       your shoes at night and get ready to lay down, there’s only One Thing can give you peace. That
       is, if you know you were dying that night, there’s only one Peace, and, that’s, Jesus is the Peace.
       He is our Peace. 55 He is our Healing. “I’m the Lord thy God that heals all of your diseases.”
       56 He is the Door to Heaven. And there’s no other door or no other way but through Jesus
       Christ. He is the Door to Heaven. 57 AND NOW JESUS IS THE DOOR TO ALL THESE
       THINGS, AND FAITH IS THE KEY THAT UNLOCKS THE DOOR. Now, if Jesus is the
       Door to all these promises of God, faith in His finished work unlocks every door to every
       treasure there is inside the Kingdom of God. See it? Key is… FAITH IS THE KEY THAT
       UNLOCKS EVERY PROMISE HE MAKES. The key of faith does that, faith in His finished
       work. It’s these keys that we’re speaking on. 58 Now in Hebrews, the 11th chapter, I got a great
       string of them wrote down here, of these heroes of faith. IT WAS THE KEY, TO—TO THE
       DOOR, THAT STOPPED THE MOUTH OF LIONS. It was the key, faith, that unlocked the
       prison houses. IT WAS FAITH, THE KEY OF FAITH, THAT QUENCHED THE
       VIOLENCE OF FIRE, ESCAPED THE EDGE OF THE SWORD, BROUGHT THE DEAD
       BACK TO LIFE AGAIN. It was faith, the key of faith in the living God. That hand, that man,
       that woman, who can take that key of faith, they can unlock every promise God made. But if
       you haven’t got that key, you’re just progging, you’ll never unlock it. You’ll beat against it,
       because this key… 59 Any correct made key has levers on the inside of the lock, and it takes a
       certain form, a certain shape of them keys to turn those levers. And just one little lever out of
       the way, will mess the whole thing up. 60 Therefore, I believe in the full Gospel, every Word of
       God, that turns the power of God loose, that turns His blessings to the people. It’s the key to
       the Door, that unlocks It. Oh, those great heroes, those prophets and great men of the Bible,
       that had that key! THAT’S THE REASON THEY COULD STOP THE MOUTH OF LIONS,
       QUENCH THE VIOLENCE OF FIRE, ESCAPE THE EDGE OF THE SWORD, BRING
       THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE AGAIN, AND DO ALL KINDS OF MIRACLES, IS BECAUSE
       THEY HELD THAT KEY AND THEY KNOWED IT WORKED, BECAUSE IT WAS A
       SCRIPTURE-BORN KEY. 61 Now, if I’m progging with a creed key, I don’t know what it’s
       going to do. If they say “my church teaches this,” I don’t know about that. 62 But when the Bible
       teaches it, and I hold the faith key in my hand, or in my heart, that says “that’s God’s Word,”
       that’ll quench the violence of fire, it’ll unlock healing for the sick, it’ll unlock salvation to the
       lost. I have to come to the Door, everything’s in His Name. “Whatever you do in word or deed,
       do it all in His Name.” Knowing that the key that you got is faith, because it’s a Scripturemade key. Now, if it’s a creed key, denominational key, I don’t know what it’ll do. But if it’s a
       Scriptural key, it’ll unlock, because God said so. Now, oh, no wonder they could stop the
       violence of fire, and so forth, they had the key. 63 God’s first nod to one of those prophets,
       nothing could stop them. He didn’t have to do like He does to me some time, pound it over and
       over, and perhaps you (I hope not), but keep telling me, “Go do this,” and then you’ll stumble
       along, “Then go do this,” and “Go back and do it again, you didn’t do it right.” JUST ONE
       LITTLE NOD! JUST, THEY COULD JUST FEEL THE SPIRIT TELL THEM, “IT’S THE
       
       82
       THING TO DO,” AND NOTHING’S GOING TO STOP THEM. BROTHER, THEY—
       THEY—THEY STOPPED THE MOUTH OF LIONS, THEY ESCAPED THE EDGE OF
       THE SWORD, THEY QUENCHED FIRE, THEY DONE EVERYTHING. JUST A LITTLE
       NOD FROM GOD, BECAUSE THEY HELD THE KEY IN THEIR HAND, THAT GREAT
       FAITH! They done things for God because nothing will stop them. Oh, how glorious!
        Now notice here you see, he said, when I ate the book it was as sweet as honey in my mouth
       but when it went down in my belly and the hand of the Lord rested upon me and I heard the
       rushin wind then it was turned into bitterness. And he said, then I was carried away by the power
       of the holy ghost, and I went into my ministry with great bitterness in my spirit and my spirit was
       hot. What was that? His spirit was bitter and his spirit was hot.
        Now look here, how they made fun of Elijah. They pestered and tormented ole Elijah Mal 4:5
       right! They tormented him and pestered him until it was terrible, what they did to the man.
       Right! until he even ran and was out in a cave hid. But he said, Elijah you’re wore out your tired
       now.” He said, “You’ve restored the word, you went upon the mountain there and you proved
       that you were my servant, you brought the restored word back and turned them back to the only
       true God. Right!

       96 And just about the time he started to take a drink, he looked over against the wall. You know,
       in the garden, there was a great candlesticks hung up. And there was a plaster on the wall. And
       the lights was reflecting against this plaster, from the garden. And his eyes bulged out. And he
       really got all shook up. The Bible said he did, said that, “His bones went out of joint, and they
       beat together.” 97 Yes, and some of these days, this nation is going to be all shook up, sure
       enough. Oh, yes. Sure. 98 They said, “Them holy-rollers, them Divine healers, that, this, that,
       and the other,” what all they are. Just wait. God is just. 99 He’ll send the Message, anyhow. He
       did in all other ages. He’ll do it now. And He is doing it, and the revival is just about over. You
       remember, it was THUS SAITH THE LORD. I said, “America made her final decision in
       1946.” Watch since then. She is gone. And there’s nothing left but judgment and chaos. Look
       what’s happened in that much time. Just watch it, how it’s going to keep faster and faster. We’re
       at the end. We’re living in the shadows of His Coming. 100 “And there will be signs in the
       heavens above and in the earth. Men’s hearts failing; fear, perplexed of time; distress between
       the nations.” “How the people will be heady, high-minded!” “How the daughters of Zion, the
       church, would walk haughty, high-minded; with the way she’d walk, and mince and twist as
       she went.” 101 Where we at? We’re with Belteshazzar’s big rock-and-roll party. And the
       church has been caught in the tide, through television, through radio, through Hollywood.
       And there we are. Real Christian women bobbing off their hair, wearing make-up on their
       faces, dressing in little old dirty clothes, because reprobate people has told them there’s no
       harm in it. 102 A Christian woman, preacher, sent a girl down here the other day, looked like
       she was poured into her clothes. She said, “Oh, Brother Branham, you’re from the old school.
       Our pastor liberates women.” I said, “Liberate them from what?” 103 They’re liberating them
       from Christ and common decency. Oh, very famous, the woman is. Certainly. But anything that
       does that is a child of hell. “By their fruits you shall know them.” What a day we are living in!
       Sure. I don’t believe…know it says how, what kind of clothes you wear, and so forth. But,
       woman, do you realize what you’re doing? You’re making yourself a sex mark to every old
       scalawag rascal that comes by. But you want liberation. It shows what spirit that’s in you. You
       
       84
       want to get free from Church, free from Christ, free from the Holy Spirit, so you can live like the
       rest of them. That don’t exclude the Branham Tabernacle. That includes the Branham
       Tabernacle, all! “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” Here we are. OH,
       WHAT A DAY! WHAT A TIME! 104 AND HE’S ALL SHOOK UP. AND HE LOOKED,

       WAS WRITING ON THE WALL, “MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.”
        Notice here, while he did that, while he was yet praying, he told his servants go and see if you
       can’t see a cloud. Go over there and see if you can’t see a cloud of glory coming. And what did
       he do, he went up there seven times and it didn’t come in any of the seven church ages, you see.
       But go up there again and when he went up there again, he looked, and said Elijah I’m sorry, I do
       see a cloud, he said it’s raising up like a man’s hand.
       1 Kings 18:41-44-Reference quote:
       1 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of
       rain.
       42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast
       himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
       43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and
       said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
       44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, BEHOLD, THERE ARISETH A
       LITTLE CLOUD OUT OF THE SEA, LIKE A MAN'S HAND. And he said, Go up, say unto
       Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.

       44 Listen, tell you what let’s you and I do, let’s do like Elijah. Let’s get the things right. Let’s get
       back to God. Then Elijah put his head down and he prayed. He said, “O God, send the rain.” He
       went up. Gehazi come back and said, “It looks like brass.” He went again, till he went the
       seventh time. And when he went the seventh time he said, “I SEE A CLOUD RISING UP OUT
       OF THE SEA, JUST LOOKS LIKE A MAN’S HAND.” And Elijah said, “I hear the sound of
       abundance of rain. Go tell Ahab to gird up his loin and go to Jezreel ’cause there’s a great rain
       coming.” Look what unbelief would have done then. Unbelief of today, the 1953 version of that
       would said, “If that’s all you can send, well, just take it back.” But when Elijah saw the first
       moving of the hand of God, he said, “I hear the sound of abundance of rain.” Look, like a
       man’s hand. LOOK HERE, J-E-S-U-S. WHEN HE SEEN THAT STANDING IN THE
       SKIES, HE KNOWED EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT. That’s right. Everything was all
       right. WHEN HE SEEN JESUS COME ON THE SCENE.
        There’s the same thing ole Ezekiel saw. Saw Christ standing there with a cloud and that hand

       therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
        Then Elijah didn’t have to pray no more because he knew that there was spiritual rain on its
       way. And then he went up there and he anointed another man. God said, now you’re tired your

       53 Elijah walked right out there, and the Bible said, “He smote them blind.” He walked out to
       them; they were blind to him. Walked out and said, “Are you looking for Elijah?” He said,
       “Yes, we’re looking for him.” 54 Said, “Come on, tell you right where he’s at,” and led them
       right into ambush, right straight where the armies walked right out and got them. 55 Now, the
       Bible said, “He smote them blind.” That settles it. AND PEOPLE ARE SO SPIRITUAL
       BLIND TODAY, THOUGH THE LORD GOD COME DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE
       PEOPLE AND DO ANYTHING, AND THE THINGS HE PROMISED, THEY STILL CAN’T
       SEE IT. THEY ARE SPIRITUALLY BLIND; DON’T KNOW GOD, DON’T KNOW HIS
       GREAT POWER. Now, we notice that they did that in the days of Elijah, and they still do it
       today. God smites them blind. They say today, that, “There is no miracles, there is no such a
       thing, all this is emotion.” 56 And they said the same thing about Elijah, because when he was
       taken up and Elisha took his place, a young man, went baldheaded, young, the children run out
       behind him, and said, “Old baldhead, why didn’t you go up with Elijah?” See, they didn’t even
       believe It in the beginning, the people, after so many things had been done. And this great man
       of God had been translated into Heaven by a chariot of fire, and the people still didn’t believe
       It. And had their little children run behind this man and say, “Old baldhead, why didn’t you
       go up?” See? And then the prophet cursed the children, and a she bear killed forty-two of
       them.
        Now notice, the hand of the Lord come upon him there at the Jordan the double portion came
       upon him the power of God came upon him. Now what’s he gonna do? He gets double of the
       power that the man had before him.
       2 Kings 2:11-15-Reference quote:
       11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot
       of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
       heaven.
       12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
       thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two
       pieces.
       13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank
       of Jordan;
       14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is
       the Lord God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither:
       and Elisha went over.
       15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The
       spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
       ground before him.

       37 Now, you see, Jesus had proven to God that He’d been the right kind of Son. And God took
       Him up on the top of the mountain, brought witnesses out there—heavenly witnesses and earthly
       witnesses—and He clothed Him in immortality. When they looked up, they said, “His garments
       shined like the sun.” A supernatural something taken place. His garments glistened like the sun
       in its middle of the day, as white as they could be. God placed on Him that robe of immortality,
       showing that He had received Him. That’s the thing that God will do to His sons here on earth
       someday. He will call you aside, Church, if you’ll only obey Him and stay on the Word and
       believe it. And He will place into the Church, before the coming of Jesus Christ… He will
       place into the Church… All the powers that Christ had in Him will be in the Church. All that
       God was, He poured into Jesus; all that Jesus was, He pours into the Church. God wanting
       His work done, He sent it into His Son; the Son wanting the work done, sent it into the
       Church. “At that day you’ll know that I’m in the Father, the Father in Me, and I in you, and
       you in Me.” At that day, because the same power of God, was in Jehovah God, rested in Jesus
       Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ, rests in the placed sons in the body of
       
       88
       Christ. 38 Placing of a son… Take him out in a certain place, have a ceremony before Angels,
       and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ. Then that person has the
       authority. Let me say this, if you count me a fanatic from this night on. That very same thing that
       I’m speaking of will be done. THERE’LL BE A POWER PUT INTO THE CHURCH, AND
       NOW IS COMING IN, THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL SO ANOINT THE PEOPLE, TILL
       THEY’LL SPEAK THE WORD AND IT’LL CREATE ITSELF RIGHT THERE. WE
       HAVEN’T SEEN POWERS LIKE’S COMING INTO THE CHURCH NOW. I KNOW IT
       FOR A FACT. “Say unto this mountain be moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that
       what you’ve said shall come to pass, you can have what you have said”: THE PLACING OF
       THE CHURCH IN POSITION, WHERE THE FULNESS OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY
       GHOST COMES INTO THE CHURCH. THEN CRITICS’ MOUTHS WILL BE SHUT.
       IT’LL BE A SHORT TIME. Jesus come right off the mountain, went straight to Calvary.
       Notice, it won’t last long, but it’ll be here.
        Notice here, Elisha comin back with a double anointing, double what that prophet had. And
       he come back with that double anointing. And look a here, it turned his spirit hot. It turned his
       spirit hot and his spirit was grieved, kinda vexed grieved hot. What was it, Elijah ministry had
       been turned down he’d been treated rough. Year in and year out and all that was inside this
       prophet now. They rejected the word of the Lord through Elijah through the church. Now here
       he’s coming back with the same message Elijah had. Coming back, he’d washed his feet and
       took care of him, see, he was his servant. Now he’s coming back anointed with double of the
       same spirit eagle anointing that was on Elijah.

       great spring or well there, many little wells, a perfect type of the church. The church is the
       judgment seat, where Heaven is the great Judgment Seat of God. And the little wells represent
       the little churches all out, and judgment begins at the house of God. See? Here’s where the

       96 And just about the time he started to take a drink, he looked over against the wall. You know,
       in the garden, there was a great candlesticks hung up. And there was a plaster on the wall. And
       the lights was reflecting against this plaster, from the garden. And his eyes bulged out. And he
       really got all shook up. The Bible said he did, said that, “His bones went out of joint, and they
       beat together.” 97 Yes, and some of these days, this nation is going to be all shook up, sure
       enough. Oh, yes. Sure. 98 They said, “Them holy-rollers, them Divine healers, that, this, that,
       and the other,” what all they are. Just wait. God is just. 99 He’ll send the Message, anyhow. He
       did in all other ages. He’ll do it now. And He is doing it, and the revival is just about over. You
       remember, it was THUS SAITH THE LORD. I said, “America made her final decision in
       1946.” Watch since then. She is gone. And there’s nothing left but judgment and chaos. Look
       what’s happened in that much time. Just watch it, how it’s going to keep faster and faster. We’re
       at the end. We’re living in the shadows of His Coming. 100 “And there will be signs in the
       heavens above and in the earth. Men’s hearts failing; fear, perplexed of time; distress between
       the nations.” “How the people will be heady, high-minded!” “How the daughters of Zion, the
       church, would walk haughty, high-minded; with the way she’d walk, and mince and twist as
       
       90
       she went.” 101 Where we at? We’re with Belteshazzar’s big rock-and-roll party. And the
       church has been caught in the tide, through television, through radio, through Hollywood.
       And there we are. Real Christian women bobbing off their hair, wearing make-up on their
       faces, dressing in little old dirty clothes, because reprobate people has told them there’s no
       harm in it. 102 A Christian woman, preacher, sent a girl down here the other day, looked like
       she was poured into her clothes. She said, “Oh, Brother Branham, you’re from the old school.
       Our pastor liberates women.” I said, “Liberate them from what?” 103 They’re liberating them
       from Christ and common decency. Oh, very famous, the woman is. Certainly. But anything that
       does that is a child of hell. “By their fruits you shall know them.” What a day we are living in!
       Sure. I don’t believe…know it says how, what kind of clothes you wear, and so forth. But,
       woman, do you realize what you’re doing? You’re making yourself a sex mark to every old
       scalawag rascal that comes by. But you want liberation. It shows what spirit that’s in you. You
       want to get free from Church, free from Christ, free from the Holy Spirit, so you can live like the
       rest of them. That don’t exclude the Branham Tabernacle. That includes the Branham
       Tabernacle, all! “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” Here we are. OH,
       WHAT A DAY! WHAT A TIME! 104 AND HE’S ALL SHOOK UP. AND HE LOOKED,

       All the churches clamoring for revival, and here God’s gonna break out not in revival, like they
       think, but great judgment comes forth and tell people they are not even saved. And then stand
       there and back it up. You remember before this man came and said this, I said years ago that God
       showed me that this ministry, that His own audible voice would prove it from Heaven. YOU
       BEAR THAT RECORD AND SEE IF THAT DON’T HAPPEN JUST LIKE THAT. GOD’S
       OWN AUDIBLE VOICE WILL SPEAK FROM HEAVEN. The same audible voice they heard
       in 1933 on the Ohio river will once again speak again. Vindicate His truth today.
        There he was Elijah himself, out in Arizona hog hutting out there with about fifteen men.
       Walking up the hill the hand of the Lord come upon him and said, “Pick up that stone and throw
       it up in the air and say thus saith the Lord, it won’t be long till you see the hand of the Lord.”
       And what was it a whirlwind come out down through there. Come around three times, went
       around one side and come around the second time and come around the third time and blowed
       rocks and everything out of the mountain. Men jumped and got under the trucks and the prophet
       took off his hat and the whirlwind come and stood over him and a voice spoke out of the

       163 And that next morning, at ten o’clock, sitting in there, my room there, about ten o’clock, the
       Angel of the Lord came down. He said, “Go to Tucson. You’ll be northeast of Tucson, and
       there will come seven Angels in a cluster that will shake the whole earth around you.” And
       said, “It’ll be told you from there.” 164 How many remembers that, here, way before it
       happened? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] There is men sitting right here in this building
       tonight, was standing right there when it happened. 165 And said, “The Seven Seals of the
       hidden mysteries of the entire Bible will be opened, and fulfill Revelation 10, that in the
       seventh Angel’s Message these things should come to pass.” This day this Scripture is fulfilled
       before our eyes. This day this Scripture is fulfilled. 166 Last year, standing in the same place,
       Mr. Wood here and I, going up the hill, in a kind of mourning, about his wife being sick. The
       Holy Spirit said, “Pick up a rock laying there. Throw it up in the air. When it comes down, say,
       ‘THUS SAITH THE LORD, THERE WILL BE JUDGMENT STRIKE THE EARTH.’ Tell
       him that he’ll see the hand of God, the next few hours.” 167 I told Mr. Wood; is present
       tonight. And, I guess, eight or ten of the men, or fifteen, that was there at that time when it took
       place; the next morning, where the Lord came down in a whirlwind and ripped the mountain out
       around us, and cut the tops of the trees loose, and made three blasts, and said, “Judgment is
       headed towards the West Coast.” 168 Two days after that, Alaska almost sunk beneath the
       earth. And since then, up-and-down the Coast, the belches of God’s judgment against that
       spiritual screen. There is a iron curtain, there is a bamboo curtain, and there is a sin curtain.
       169 Civilization has traveled with the sun; so has the Gospel. They’ve come from the east and
       went west, like the sun goes. And now It’s on the West Coast. It can’t go no further; if It goes
       further, IT’LL BE BACK EAST AGAIN. 170 The prophet said, “There will come a day that
       cannot be called night or day,” a dismal day, a lot of rain and fog, just enough how to know how
       to join a church or put your name on a book. “But it shall be Light about the evening time.”
       This day this Scripture is fulfilled. 171 The same—the same s-u-n that rises in the east is the
       same s-u-n that sets in the west. And the same S-o-n of God that come in the east and
       vindicated Himself as God manifested in the flesh, is the same S-o-n of God in the western
       hemisphere here, that’s identifying Himself among the church tonight, the same yesterday,
       today, and forever. The evening Light of the Son has come. This day this Scripture is fulfilled
       before us. 172 Where we at in this Abrahamic age? Where are we in this great time we’re
       standing, the great hour that we’re living in? All the visions has been fulfilled.
        What was it brother? That’s after the seals were open. SHOWING YOU NOW, THAT GOD
       IS GONNA SEND FORTH HIS HAND OF JUDGEMENT TO THE PEOPLE that’s turned
       down the word. That’s in love with the things of the world, that’s living loose. Here He’s coming
       now in judgement. Oh, what a fearful thing children, God help us run to the rocks. You see that!
        Alright now! Watch here, you got your bible open up to Revelations now. Let’s go back over
       here now.

        Now notice here, when Brother Branham was up in Sabino Canyon praying about this great
       thing that happen to him when the seals were open. And a voice boomed out of the Canyon and
       said, “Brother Branham don’t fear this is the vindication of your ministry, the third pull. Don’t
       fear brother Branham this is the third pull, the vindication of your ministry.”
        Well, you say, “I thought he was already vindicated?” No! No, his first pull was vindicated,
       his second pull was vindicated but the third pull wasn’t vindicated.

       of the King!” And then I come out of it. 288 “The Sword of the King.” Now, if It said, “A sword
       of a king…” But It said, “The Sword of the King.” And there is only one “the King,” and that’s
       God. And He has one Sword, that’s His Word, what I’ve lived by. That, so help me, God;

       Standing there when this left me, Something just come to me and said, “Don’t fear.” Now, I
       didn’t hear no voice. Like on the inside of me, spoke. I have to just tell you the truth, just exactly
       what happened. Something hit, and said, “Don’t fear. This is that Third Pull.” 290 Third Pull!
       You remember It? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] He said, “You’ve had so many
       impersonators on this, what you tried to explain. But,” said, “don’t even try, This.” You

       everywhere. That’s been about six years ago, seven years ago. Been seven years ago. Said,
       “Don’t try to explain That.” Said, “This is the Third Pull, but I’ll meet you in there.” That right?
       [“Amen.”] He said, “Don’t try…” 291 I was standing with a—a little baby’s shoe, when He told
       me. Said, “Now make your First Pull. And when you do, the fish will run after the lure.” Said,
       “Then watch your Second Pull,” said, “because It’ll only be small fish.” HE SAID, “THEN

       8 The hope of all the ages rests there on the Person of the Lord Jesus returning the second
       time. He was a man, yes. But He was the God-man. God was in Christ reconciling the world to
       Himself: Jehovah’s tabernacle. “Not Me that doeth the works; it’s My Father that dwelleth in
       Me,” said the Son. “He doeth the works.” IN ANOTHER WORDS, IN THAT DAY THE
       FATHER WAS THE VINE. HE WAS THE BRANCH TO BEAR THE FRUIT OF GOD.
       NOW, HE BECOMES THE VINE, AND WE BECOME THE BRANCH. AND ALL THAT
       WAS IN GOD WAS POURED INTO CHRIST. Are you ready? Here it is. It may gag you a
       little. But listen. All that was in Christ was poured into the Church. “The works that I do shall
       you also. More than this shall you do, for I go to My Father.” You see it? We are living under
       our God given privileges that God has redeemed us to. 19 In our picture when He had taken
       these three witnesses to go up to testify of something… Now, perhaps maybe I’m going to take it
       in a little different angle. IT REALLY REPRESENTED THE COMING OF CHRIST THE
       SECOND TIME ON THE APPEARING OF MOSES and ELIJAH AND THEN CHRIST
       ONLY. But it represents something more.

       you’re pressed out, then watch what I’m fixing to tell you in a few minutes. Watch the Third
       Pull then, see, and it’ll be absolutely to the total lost, but it—it will be for the Bride and the
       Church. 50 Now we are closer than it seems to be. I don’t know when, but it’s real, real close. I
       may be building a platform for somebody else to step on. I may be taken before that time. I don’t
       know. And that time may be this coming week, that the Holy Spirit will come with…and bring
       Christ Jesus. He may come this next week. He may come yet tonight. I don’t know when He will
       come. He doesn’t tell us that. 51 But I do believe, that we are so close, that I would never die
       with old age. Yet, at fifty-four years old, I’ll never die with old age, until He’s here. See? Unless
       I’m shot, killed, or something other, some way killed, just old age wouldn’t kill me, until He’s
       come. And I believe that. 52 And I want to say this. I’ve never said it before. But according to
       Scripture, according to what He said thirty years ago; thirty-three years ago on the river down
       there, in 1933, rather; what He said, everything has happened just exactly. I may not do it, but
       this Message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world. For, “As John the Baptist was sent to
       forerun the first coming, so is the Message to forerun the second Coming.” And John said,
       “Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.” See? So, it’s, it paralleled it in
       every way. And I know it will, the Message will go on.
        Now watch here, now the third pull is the vindication of your ministry Brother Branham.
       Brother Branham said, if God don’t come and vindicate my ministry and the opening of the
       seals, I’ll be found a false prophet. He said, now you see what I’ve put myself out on this limb.
       All right now watch here. Now notice here, now give me your attention honey,
       don’t…don’t…just give me your attention just a little minute here.
        Now watch! Now here is this Son of Man revelation 10:7 now opens up the mysteries of
       what’s written inside of the bible. Now he opens the mysteries inside of the bible.
       Revelation 10:7-Reference quote:
       7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
       God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
       And then on the outside of the Bible it’s sealed with seven mysterious thunders. And it’s
       not…Oh God help you people to see this! It’s not what’s written on the inside of the book that
       turns the hearts back again to the faith of the fathers, it’s what’s written on the outside of the
       book.

       You remember in the heaven, the Book was laying sealed with seven seals on the backside.
       You remember that? And did you ever think that we have come through Luther’s justification,
       through Wesley’s sanctification, through Pentecostal Holy Ghost, and still we’re kindly

       IN HERE; IT’S IN THE SEALS. We’re going to teach on those things, the Lord willing, when I
       come back. Remember, Daniel heard those seven voices, uttered their voices, and he started
       writing; He said, “Don’t—don’t write it.” SEE? “IT’LL BE REVEALED IN THE LAST
       DAYS.” Is that right? 13 John saw the same thing, and when he saw it on—on there, this Book

       on the backside, after it was done been taught all the way through, ON THE BACKSIDE HAD
       SEVEN SEALS. And these was to be loosened when the mystery of God would be fulfilled.
       We’re at that time, for the seven mysteries to be opened up to the church. Oh, what rich

       391 Now, now, do you notice? On the opening of this Seventh Seal, it’s also in a threefold
       mystery. This one, I have…will speak and have spoke, that it is the mystery of the Seven
       Thunders. The Seven Thunders in Heaven will unfold this mystery. It’ll be right at the Coming
       of Christ, because Christ said no one knew when He would return. 392 Did you notice, when
       the Jews asked Him that? Know… When we compared the Scripture here with Matthew 24, with
       the six Seals, the Seventh Seal was left out. Because, you see, Christ said, “Only God Himself
       knowed; not even the Angels.” No wonder, It wasn’t even written. You see, they hushed;
       nothing take place then. Angels don’t know It. Nobody knows when He is coming. 393 BUT
       THERE’LL BE A—THERE’LL BE A—A SEVEN VOICES, OF THESE THUNDERS,
       THAT WILL REVEAL THE GREAT REVELATION AT THAT TIME. So, I believe, to us
       who…If we don’t know It, and if we…It won’t be knowed till that time. But it will be revealed in
       that day, in the hour that it’s supposed to be revealed in. So, the thing for us to do is to be
       reverent before God, and serve Him, and do all that we know how to do, and live good, Christian
       lives. Here, now, we find that the Sixth Seal has been opened to us; we see It. And we know that
       this Seventh Seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrive. 394 Now, there was
       SOME REASON THAT GOD LET THIS SEVEN VOICES BE THUNDERED. Because, It
       must come, see. For the…We find that CHRIST, THE LAMB, TOOK THE—THE BOOK IN
       HIS HAND, AND HE OPENED THAT SEVENTH SEAl. But, you see, it’s a hidden mystery.
       No one knows It. But, It—It, right along with what He said, “No one would know His
       Coming.” They also would not know about this Seven-Thunder mystery. So, you see, it’s
       connected together. 395 That much, we have an understanding of It, today, because the rest of It
       is all unfolded; but this is not unfolded. But sitting in my room, and I heard this…or, not heard it,
       rather, but seen It unfold to this Seven Thunders. Now, that’s as far as we can go, right there.
       396 And now I trust that each and every one of you will serve God and do that which is right.
       And love Him, all your life, and serve Him. And God will take care of the rest. 397 Now, we
       have, in the completion here now, by the grace of God, all the mysteries of the six Seals that’s
       been sealed up, and we understand and know here that the Seventh Seal is not to be known to
       the public. 398 Now, His Coming, at the hour of His Coming, when the destruction of the earth,
       you know. He said there, “What will be the sign of the coming of the end of the world?” In
       Matthew 24, there where they asked Him that question. He went down to that. He told about
       Israel being gathered as a nation, in the 31st verse, of Matthew 24:31. But then He started off on
       parables, see. Then you see the… “Learn a parable of the fig tree. When you see it putting forth
       its buds, why, you know spring is nigh. And then when you see this coming to pass, then know the
       
       99
       time is nigh.” See, Israel gathering in its own homeland. But, you notice, He omitted the
       revelation of this Seventh Seal. 399 And here, when the Seventh Seal, when He opened It, He
       also omitted It again, see. So we see that It is a complete mystery, therefore the hour is not yet
       for the mystery to be known. Therefore, we’re this far, and the rest of IT WILL BE KNOWN
       RIGHT AROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT JESUS APPEARS ON EARTH AGAIN, FOR
       HIS BRIDE, OR WHATEVER TAKES PLACE AT THAT TIME. Now, until that time, let’s
       just all pray, live good, straight, Christian lives, looking forward for His Coming. 400 And now
       if this tape would happen to fall into the hand of some persons somewhere, don’t try to make any
       kind of an ism out of it. The only thing you do, you just continue serving God. Because, this
       great secret is so great that God wouldn’t even let John write It. It thundered out, but
       He…knowing that, promising us that It would be opened. But, to this time, It isn’t opened. 401
       And now we are grateful to God for what He has showed us. I been sitting in the room up there
       for eight days. And the Message that I have just got through explaining to you, many of you here
       will understand. And I promised that there was something going on, spiritual, all the time, that I
       was sure you were missing it. And here is what it is; it’s the absolute vindication of this
       interpretation of the Scriptures being sent of God.
        And if you’re not deadly sincere and love that word and prayer and Jesus Christ more than
       anything else in the world, husbands, lands and lots and wives’ sisters and brothers, friends and
       everything you’ll never hear that voice speaking on the outside of the book. See we’re not huntin
       nobody but ourselves. Remember you’ll either gonna love him with all your heart or live the life
       or your gonna miss the rapture. And just the way you’re living right today, the way your heart is
       towards God and the way you repent and line up with the word shows whether or not if your
       gonna make it. And you ain’t foolin' nobody but yourselves. People ain’t foolin' nobody but
       their self. If you love something out there in the world more than you love the revealed word of
       God your gonna stay right here with the world, see. Oh, you can read what’s on the inside of the
       book. You can read what’s on the inside of the book, but you’ll never be able to hear what’s on
       the outside of the book, written on the outside. That’s only given to them that love him with all
       their heart all their soul and all their might and all their strength. I know I hate to put it that way
       but it’s the truth children. You cannot play with God. Your thoughts speak louder in heaven then
       your voice does down here on earth.
        Do you see what the bible said, I tremble at scriptures like this over in the gospels said, when
       these little ones begin to seek the kingdom said it would be better that a mill stone was hung
       around your neck. A millstone that weighs hundreds and hundreds of pounds and hung it around
       your neck and took you out and dropped you in the deepest place in the ocean and you sunk to
       the bottom with that millstone. Would be better than to offend the least one of these people that’s
       seeking the kingdom that token. And when you see people rise up and begin to speak evil against
       people that’s trying to press their way into the kingdom the token and begin to say they’re of the
       devil and they’re all goin to hell then you can see they are blaspheming their selves away from
       the kingdom of heaven, see. Oh, how we ought to fear God. I fear God. We ought to fear God
       with fear and trembling, see. Oh my, see! It’s a fearful thing!
       Matthew 18:6-Reference quote:
       6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that
       a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

        Now notice here see, this seventh seal book has been opened by messenger prophet and he’s
       sealed away in death. All right now but the little book has been opened now. It’s open and here it
       comes, here it comes to the Son of Man Ezekiel and then it comes over here and here’s the same
       thing comin out, here’s another prophet another Son of Man, John he was called. Now here’s the
       little book now, Son of Man bringing out the same thing showing here to John so John could
       write it. Now here John comes up here and now let’s read up here in verse 8.
        Now how many see Revelation 10:7. He’s already gone now, but he’s already on the earth at
       the time that this mighty angel comes down from heaven. His body his literal ministry is still on
       the earth. And what was it? When the seals were open then the messenger really in essence said
       this to the bride, I Am The Friend of The Bridegroom. He said, I only stand by now and I’m
       decreasing. I’m decreasing I’m getting ready to fade away but the one that I’m introducing to
       you…I baptized you with water in the name of Jesus Christ, Acts 2:38 brought all these great
       mysteries seed of the serpent, women preachers, one God all these things that we’re on the inside

       understood; It’s probed at, through six church ages. But at the end, when the seventh angel
       begins to sound his mystery, he winds up all of the loose ends that these fellows probed at.
       AND THE MYSTERIES COMES DOWN FROM GOD, AS THE WORD OF GOD, AND
       REVEALS THE ENTIRE REVELATION OF GOD, THEN THE GODHEAD AND
       EVERYTHING ELSE IS SETTLED. ALL THE MYSTERIES, SERPENT’S SEED, AND
       WHATEVER MORE, IS TO BE REVEALED. 40 Now, you see, I’m just not making that up.
       That’s what… It’s THUS SAITH THE LORD. I’ll read It to you out of the Book, “The

       65-0219 - This Day This Scripture Is Fulfilled
       William Marrion Branham
       175 And I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed it. I said, “The entire Bible, as
       much as been revealed to man, through justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy
       Ghost, the baptism in Jesus’ Name, and all these things, has been revealed; but there is secrets
       that’s hid inside, because the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals. I must go there to find it.” 176
       That morning when those seven Angels come down and blasted the earth, and rocks flew every
       way, seven Angels stood there and said, “Return back to Jeffersonville, from where you come
       from, for the Seven Seals of the seven mysteries will be opened.” 177 Here we are, today,
       understanding Serpent’s Seed. In a few days, if God willing, we’ll understand the correctness
       of Marriage And Divorce. And all these things that God has opened, every Seal, the mysteries
       since the foundation of the world. And we’ve been in joy, the Presence of His blessings! That is

       17 Wonder if you little boys or some of you could tell me who the third man was that had that
       Spirit? Could you do it? Huh? Any student there can raise your hand and tell me who the third
       man was that had that same Spirit? Huh? John the Baptist. He came out of the wilderness. Jesus
       said, “This is the Elijah which was spoke of was to come restore all things.” And it made
       Elijah—made John dress just like Elijah, perhaps acted like him, but John did no miracles. And
       that same Spirit is predicted to come on the earth today again the second time. And I believe
       that it’s on the earth today. AND IT IS PREACHING A GREAT MESSAGE OF
       REPENTANCE THROUGH A MIGHTY MAN OF GOD who does no miracles, speaks not of
       miracles, BUT BLASTING THE WORLD DOWN WITH A MESSAGE OF REPENTANCE.
       AND FOLLOWING JOHN CAME JESUS, not preaching too much, not much of a preacher,
       but was performing signs and wonders as a vindication that JOHN’S MINISTRY WAS IN
       SEASON AND A VINDICATED. So we’re thankful to the LORD TO BE LIVING TO SEE
       THE DAY THAT HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF AGAIN. AND WE’RE LIVING IN THAT
       DAY.
        But now, he that’s coming Christ is greater than I, because he’s greater, cause I’m the Voice
       of one crying in the wilderness bridging the way, bringing the word so he could come. I’m the
       way maker, I’m the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way for the Christ to
       come, the Voice to come down from heaven, make way for him.

       27 And if that man building that bridge, so time-tested everything, even to the bolts that he put
       into the bridge, he put a magnet on them to see if they were genuine steel or not. When he went
       to fix the great tower… They said that in the middle of the water… They said that it taken him, I
       don’t know how long to sink this column down into there, and to be sure that nobody lost their
       life in doing it, as far as humanly possible. And he dug down, he struck one layer; he tested the
       stone, it wasn’t the right kind. He blowed deeper and deeper and deeper, because he knowed
       this great arch out here in the middle would be the thing that would give, that on the bridge, it
       has to be set on the right kind of rock. 28 How God did that when between the Old and New
       Testament, He spanned His plan of salvation, He hoisted up an ensign on Golgotha’s hill,
       none other than the Son of God, to join man and to God. It was time-tested. He tested it
       through the seed of Abraham, on down through Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, down through David, and
       ON DOWN TO THE END UNTIL THAT PERFECT SEED COME THAT COULD STAND
       IN THE MIDDLE AND HOLD SINNER ON ONE END AND GOD ON THE OTHER AND
       BRIDGE THE WAY. Every Word that He spoke, every Word that was placed into the Bible
       was time-tested by the Holy Ghost. Therefore I believe every timber. Amen. Every precept of
       God is right. Everything that’s written in this Bible, I’d be willing to lay my life down for it. I
       may not have faith enough to make every promise come true, but I’ll never stand in somebody
       else’s way who does have faith to do it. If I can’t walk where Enoch walked one day and went
       home without dying, I wouldn’t stand in somebody else’s way who could walk that way with
       God. That’s right. Time-tested, and I believe that every Word of God is pure and
       unadulterated, for God is putting His timber, because He’s positive that His reputation as a
       Saviour will not be spoiled. That’s right. Time-tested it, knowed that it was right… 29 How that
       many while this bridge was going up, many prophesied and said, “It’ll fall down. It’ll fall
       down.” How that those surveyors went forth, and they checked everything to be sure of coming
       from both shores to meet out here in the middle. How everything must be perfect, must meet their
       adjustments in the eighth of an inch or an inch, so that it would come together just right. And on
       the day of the coming together, when both ends would join together, see… ’Cause the man had
       done all that he could do with the reputation he had, he had planned it so perfectly till both ends
       come together within an inch apart, each one, perfect as it could be. How the people screamed
       and shouted when they knowed the job was completed. 30 And how the people today who’s lost
       and undone without Christ, how we can rejoice and praise God that the expansion was met
       right when God sent Jesus Christ to the earth and He died at Calvary to bridge the way for
       sinful men and women to meet their Redeemer and their Maker. And none other is this Bridge
       but Almighty God Himself. His Word is Him, Himself. And HE LAID HIS OWN LIFE
       DOWN THAT WE COULD WALK OVER HIM INTO GLORY. ONE END OF THE
       BRIDGE WAS NOTHING ELSE BUT EMMANUEL, “GOD WITH US.” At the other end of
       the bridge is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ Who stands in the power and glory of the
       Father. Amen. The connection is right: His Word. Every Old Testament prophecy pointed
       straight to Calvary. Every New Testament prophecy points back to the finished work at
       Calvary. And why would we here in the last days, try to point off to something else? It wouldn’t
       be right. It’d be wrong.

       believers bringing them into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. How? By one Holy Ghost
       baptism are they all baptized into the body of Christ. Gathering the wheat into his garner. What’s
       his garner? His body is his garner. Where does he gather wheat? You gather the wheat into the

        What if it turned out like that little brother from over sea’s there Brother Stanley’s dream. The
       man’s a spiritual dreamer. Brought me three or four dreams I know they’re from the Lord. He
       had a dream the other night and told the Major here, Brother McGhee. And he said the anointing
       was powerful that come forth from that dream. And he said, “It kept him anointed for two days
       after he heard it felt the presence of God around him. And brother Stanley said, “When the token
       comes,” he said “There was only about seven left.”
        Remember your sins are finding you out. All across the country, people that’s claiming to be
       believers and claim to be baptized with the holy ghost, men that’s preaching the message,
       prophesying speaking with tongues and claiming to have the revelation are living with other
       women…men that’s not even their wives, committing adultery and everything. And won’t even
       repent.
        The Lord showed me that. Spoke to me there one night and then I found out about it here a
       man that’s right on tape here and everything and won’t even repent and leave his church. Still
       trying to hold onto his church after he lived with another woman. And claiming to have the
       baptism of the holy ghost.
        I TELL YOU HE’S A HOLY GOD, HE’S NOT A DIRTY GHOST. YOUR SACRIFICE
       HAS GOT TO BE WASHED AND CLEANSED BY THE WASHING OF THE WATER OF
       THE REVEALED WORD OF GOD AND THE HEART CLEANSED OF THE OLE DIRTY
       SERPENT DOWN ON THE INSIDE. What we need is the acts of God. We need the sword of
       God to slap us down through the heart and cut off the head of that serpent that’s layin down in
       the heart. The heart is deceitfully wicked. Who knoweth the heart? We got a serpent layin down
       in there, across the earth. What we need is the revealed word of God and a real sanctification to
       cleanse that serpent out of the heart. Fill it full of the Love of God and a dove, of tender and
       compassion.

       1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude
       of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
       2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
       3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
       4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be
       justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
       5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
       6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to
       know wisdom.
       7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
       8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
       9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
       10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
       11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
       12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
       13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
        You know God said the kind of person he’s near and who he’s gonna seal, is a person that’s

       365 He, He said, “Son of man is going up to Jerusalem. I’m going to be put in the hands of
       sinners, and they’re going to kill the Son of man. And He’s going to die, and on the third day
       He’s going to rise again.” Said, “Don’t tell nobody the vision, up there.”366 And the disciples,
       now think of it, disciples who had walked with John, talked with him, eat with him, in the
       wilderness, sat out on the banks, then they said, “Why does the teachers say that Elias must first
       come? You say You’re going up for the crucifixion, and going to rise. You’re the Messiah, take
       the throne. Now why does the scribes…? All of our Scriptures say here, the Scriptures plainly
       says, that, before the Christ shall come, that Elias will come first.” Yeah. See? 367 He said, “He
       has already come, and you didn’t know it.” Now, who was that? Disciples. 368 I’m going to hurt
       here, just a little bit now, but don’t mean it, see; for the next few minutes, see, just a minute, or
       two, but so that you’ll be sure to understand. Can you hear me?[Congregation says, “Amen.”—
       Ed.] 369 Look! “Why?” Them men who had walked with Christ, “Why does the Scriptures, first,
       say that Elias must come?” AND THEY WERE JOHN’S OWN CONVERTS, AND DIDN’T
       EVEN KNOW HIM. “Why did the Scriptures say, the teachers?” You see what I
       mean? See? “Why does the Scriptures say that Elias must first come?” Disciples that walked
       with him, “Why does the Scriptures say that he must first come, before these things, and restore
       all things?” HE DID, TO ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE, AND THAT’S ALL THERE
       WAS. SEE? THAT’S ALL WAS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE IT. THAT WAS WHAT WAS
       
       109
       ORDAINED TO SEE IT. 370 Jesus said, “He’s already come, and you didn’t know it. But he
       done just what the Scriptures said he would do. He restored them, you all that received Me and
       believed on Me. He done exactly what the Scriptures said he’d do. And they did to him what the
       Scriptures said they would do. He has already come, and you didn’t know it.”
       371 Are you ready? I want to shock you a little bit. THE RAPTURE WILL BE THE SAME
       WAY. IT’LL BE SO SIMPLE, NO DOUBT IT’LL BE LIKEWISE, TILL THE RAPTURE
       WILL COME ONE OF THESE DAYS AND NOBODY WILL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
       IT. Now, don’t, don’t, don’t get up now, but study just a minute. I’m sure enough closing. The
       Rapture will come in such a simple way till the judgments will fall, and they’ll see the Son of
       man, and they’ll say, “Wasn’t we supposed to have such-and-such? And wasn’t there
       supposed to be Elias sent to us? And wasn’t there supposed to be a Rapture?” 372 Jesus will
       say, “It’s already happened, and you didn’t know it.” God in simplicity. See? 373 Now, this
       week we’re going to get in some awful deep teaching on the Word. NOW, NOTICE, THE
       RAPTURE, WILL BE SO FEW GO IN THAT BRIDE! IT’LL NOT BE…
        There ain’t no easy way, you can’t say anything you want to. You can’t live any way you
       want to and come into that body! No! It’s walking with every word of God, brother, straight as a

        How many of you want to walk with God? (Amen) May God wake us up, oh Lord help me,
       I’m preaching to myself. My God, help me to fear and tremble to think this revelation has fell
       into my hands here. Oh Lord, don’t cast me aside. As I preached the other night, that I’d be a
       cast away. Now, I don’t mean lost, cast away! I’ll come up in the resurrection, but I want to
       come up in the first resurrection. I want to go in the rapture, I don’t want my ole body to lay in
       the grave for a thousand years. I WANT TO BE CHANGED IN A MOMENT IN A
       TWINKLING OF AN EYE, I WANT TO BE CAUGHT TO MEET HIM IN THE AIR. That’s
       what I want! Do it quickly, line our lives up with the word of God, see!

       28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
       29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden
       under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
       sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
       30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the
       Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
       31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
       
        Now look here, let’s look at this. Do you see that the prophet messenger is to open up the
       seals and he reveals… but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he begins to sound,
       
       110
       all the seed of the serpent doctrine, all them doctrines of the bible? Jesus name baptism and all
       that, holy ghost baptism and all those things, that’ll be revealed.
        But, on the backside of the bible is Seven Thunders, that’s not even written that you don’t

       405 Another thing, I want you to notice what taken place. And if you’re listening to the tape, of
       the What Time Is It, Sir?, you will notice that one Angel was very notable to me. The rest of
       Them just was seemed ordinarily. But this Angel was a noted Angel. He was to my left, in the
       constellation in the form of a pyramid. 406 And, remember, it was in the pyramid, where the
       mysterious white Rock was not written on. And the Angels took me into that pyramid of
       Themselves, the mysteries of God known only to Them. And, now, Them was the
       MESSENGERS had come to interpret that pyramid, or that Message of the secret of these
       Seven Seals which lays withinside the pyramid. 407 Now, the Angel, was to my left, would
       really be the last, or seventh Angel, if we would count Them from left to right. Because, He was
       on my left; me looking to Him, towards the west, HIM COMING TOWARDS THE EAST,
       would be on the left side. SO, THAT WOULD BE THE LAST ANGEL’S MESSAGE, VERY
       NOTABLE. Remember how I said He had His, got His head back; and His great, sharp wings;
       and how He flew right to me. Now, that is this Seventh Seal. It still is a notable thing. And we
       are…We don’t know what It is, as yet, because It’s not permitted to be broken.

       Seal. Remember, He hid the Seventh Seal from us. He wouldn’t do it. When the Angel stood,
       day by day, telling it, but then He wouldn’t do it on that one. Said, “There is silence in
       Heaven.” No one knew. It was the Coming of the Lord.
       
        Now notice here that the Son of Man ate the little book, he ate what was written.
       Now I hope you get this now, in closing.
        Now in closing. It was written …I’m not going to get all pressed! I’m gonna bring this out.
       Give me another thirty minutes. (Brother is disturbed and hurt after chastising the people)
        It was wrote on the inside and it’s wrote on the outside. Now this Son of Man eats everything
       that’s written on the inside and he eats what on the outside. Now notice after he eats it, then he’s
       gonna bring it out. How many believe that? (Amen) Now is that right with the word of God, let’s

       Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
       honey.
       10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet
       as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.

       268 A prophet is God’s reflector. How many knows that? The—the reflector doesn’t reflect
       itself, the—the reflector isn’t the reflection. There has to be something strike the reflector—
       reflector to make it reflect. So a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing
       at all but he’s in direct line with that reflection, God, to reflect the image of Christ, the Word.
       See, nothing else can do it. YOU ARE A REFLECTOR, THAT’S THE REASON THE

       William Marrion Branham
       515 “He is the first fruits of the resurrection.” Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—
       Ed.] Watch. Then, what is He? “He is the Head of the Body, which is His Church, Bride.” Uhhuh. 516 Then, the Bride-Body must follow the Head, for it is part of His resurrection and part of
       the mystery. It’s impossible for it not to go. Oh, my! IT’S PART OF GOD’S MYSTERY, HOW
       GOD REVEALED HIMSELF HERE AND RAISED IT UP BY THE WORD, SO HE
       REVEALS THE CHURCH AND RAISING IT UP BY THE SAME WORD. IT’S A PART OF
       HIS THREEFOLD MYSTERY. 517 AS THE HEAD WAS TOOK FROM THE GRAVE, SO
       MUST THE BODY FOLLOW HIM BACK TO EDEN. Where, the Head of the family, the
       Man, the Bridegroom; the Bride being the Body of the Bridegroom, must follow, the Bride,
       because that’s the Head. And the Head is revealed, and come back with Eternal Life; and the
       Body must follow that, because it is Husband and Wife again. Amen! And as long as you’re
       pregnated with the same Word, which is His Body; you’ve took His Body, become in Him, when
       you took the Word. Not the creed; the Word! Oh, my! 518 Wouldn’t that make a text for this
       afternoon, to go on? Huh? My, wouldn’t that be wonderful? See? Just think of it now, what it is.
       519 Therefore, the Body cannot recognize…Don’t you fail this. The Body, therefore, cannot
       recognize any other headship but the Word. Cause, the—the Head is connected with the Body,
       and the Head is the Word, and it’s the same Word, one Headship! Therefore, denominations,
       
       112
       and holy fathers, and everything else, is dead dung. There is one Headship, that’s Christ. The
       Body only recognizes one thing, the Word!
        Now watch here, let’s watch it now! Oh, children we ought to stick together with the love of
       God, we ought to be bound together with such love of God with all the things you have heard.
       Knowing that you’ve separated from all unbelief. What… You’ve come from miles around and
       people have moved here and gave up everything in the world to come and get the token. My God
       help us to live everything that we can live. Just line up with everything and if we make mistakes
       or whatever it is, just quickly repent. Never offend one another with word or deed or mouth
       whatever it is, just sweetness and kindness and tenderness and the love of God. Looking up for
       our redemption is drawing nigh. Waiting for that rushing wind, waiting for that power of God to
       sweep down. Oh, we ought to be the happiest people on earth.
        People cross the land, don’t know what God is doing. Men goin around preachin with all they
       have to preach and they say that, “Any minute brother Branham goin to raise up.” Oh, God that’s
       idolatry. Any minute brother Branham’s gonna raise up. What gonna raise him up? There would
       have to be a ministry here to call him up. And he’d be greater than he that was in the grave. Then
       you’ll have to follow that! Because that’ll be a continuation of what he said. Oh, how blind
       people are. Brother Branham never rejoiced to see anything like that! Brother Branham don’t
       want to be made that people worship him. What’s the matter with people? We need to separate
       from all this unbelief and not have nothing to do with it and gather ourselves together for God to
       pour out his spirit upon us. That’s what we need is a waiting upon the Lord and a heartfelt
       repentance from the back of the church clear to the pulpit. We need to repent every day! I believe
       it’s the sinners that’s got sin, a sinner is a Christian. We got all kinds of sin with this outward
       body, this ole flesh is gonna give us trouble all the time, till we get down to business with it and
       put it under. Oh, how wonderful to crucify it and put it under the Lord. It’s sweet…It’s sweet
       when you can overcome something in your life.
        I seen ole Brother Kevin come in with that baby wrapped up comin in. I said, “Lord, oh that
       brother really overcome God bless him.”
        I seen ole Bill Whatley, preached all over the country, all over Canada and everywhere a good
       preacher. Preached all kinds of good messages but didn’t live nothing. And when I first seen
       him, I said, “Bill Whatley you’re a mess,” but I said, “I like ya!” I know what he lived; I know
       what he was livin. And then when he come, I said to my wife, I said, “Honey you take that Bill
       Whatley” … I know Bill’s a preacher and he don’t mind me sayin this. Because I’m not a
       hypocrite, I tell you right to your face what I think about you. Right to your face, I’m not the
       kind of pastor to go around and eat chicken with you and pet you when you’re wrong. When
       your wrong I’ll bust your hid and TELL YOU THE TRUTH! Why? BECAUSE I LAY ON MY
       FACE AND CRY TO GOD FOR YOU BECAUSE I LOVE YOU! And I told my wife, I said,
       “Honey you take that Bill Whatley I love him.” I said, “Because he’s a nothing, he’s a nobody,
       he’s in a miserable condition. But see now, look at him, see.” I let him preach because I want to
       help him, I see something in the man. And he gets up there and what’s he do? He don’t try to act
       holy and Pious before the people, try to make the people think he’s a great something. But get up
       there and tells every sin he’s got and asks for prayer. I said, now there is a person that God can
       use.
        Jesus Christ came and looked at that ministry that day and said, “Woe unto you preacher that
       white washed sepulchers you. Outside you may be clean to cut but inside your dirty and filthy
       
       113
       and black and are raving wolves.” Said, “You love the greetings in the market places, you love
       your phylacteries wrapped around your arm, goin along quoting Isaiah nine and six his name
       shall be called wonderful councilor the mighty God the everlasting father.” Going in the
       synagogues and quoting those scriptures through the market places and everybody bowing to

       morning, no more would happen. Or, if you would believe with the measure of faith, that, no
       more could happen than what will happen, if you believe with the same measure of faith.
       Because, I only represent Him. I’m a sinner saved by grace, just a man like you are, just a
       human being. But God has to have an outlet somewhere. And He’s proved that by His Word.
       He’s proved it by the ministry. He’s proved it by the Angel of the Lord. And here it is. Now it’s
       up to us, to believe it.
        Oh, God! They say, “Look at you and you claim to be the Messiah and WHO DO YOU
       HANG AROUND WITH? NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF SINNERS AND PUBLICANS.”
       BUT BROTHER HIS REPUTATIONS WASN’T HURT BY SINNERS, IT WAS MADE BY
       SINNERS SAVED BY GRACE. HOW SWEET THE SOUND THAT SAVED A WRETCH
       LIKE ME! He didn’t lose his reputation by sinners; his reputation was made among sinners, the
       whores and harlots and prostitutes and back washers and everything else.
       Matthew 9:10-13-Reference quote:
       10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners
       came and sat down with him and his disciples.
       11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with
       publicans and sinners?
       12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but
       they that are sick.
       13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not
       come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
        IT’S NOT WHAT WE WAS! BUT IT’S WHAT WE ARE BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND
       THE BLOOD OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST! That’s what we are! Forsake our sins, live
       before the Lord and raise hands to heaven and praise him for his grace, sinners saved by grace.
       Amen.
        Think about it children, how this little assembly ought to be bound together with the love of
       God that nothing could separate us. How there ought to be crying and tears and weeping and
       groaning’s ascending up to God to thrust forth this ministry into the field today. We need it so
       bad; PEOPLE ARE PERISHING WITHOUT THE WORD OF GOD. NO REVELATION
       NOWHERE, NO PRESENCE OF GOD, NO QUICKENING POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST,
       just interpretations of man. How they need the revelation of God to shine across this earth to
       being the seeds to eternal life. Think about it!
        Let’s look here now. Let’s look here at John little book here. Let’s watch here now, verse 8.
       All right now, we see him come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow over his
       head, coming in a day of rain, see. Coming with a covenant, a King, the Lion of the tribe of
       Judea, coming now with his Kingdom.
       
       115
       Ezekiel 1:28-Reference quote:
       28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance
       of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.
       And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
       Revelation 10:1-2-Reference quote:
       1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a
       rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
       2 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left
       foot on the earth,
        Jesus said, “There be some standing here which will not taste death, till they see the kingdom
       of God come with great power.” Another scripture said, “Some standing here shall not see death
       until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom with great glory.”
       Matthew 16:28-Reference quote:
       28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they
       see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
        And there was a hundred and twenty saw his kingdom come. How did it come? With a rushin
       mighty wind on the day of Pentecost.
       Acts 2:1-2-Reference quote:
       1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
       2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all
       the house where they were sitting.
        Here he comes in his kingdom the Lion of the tribe of Judea, harvest time. He’s coming now
       as a King; he’s got a Kingdom to be Baptized into it with. The word of God the full body
       revealed word of God, the little book has been open. It releases the power of the holy ghost down
       among the people. THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE ON EARTH TODAY. WHERE’S IT AT?
       HE’S LEADING AND GUIDING THE ELECTED INTO ALL TRUTH. He ain’t off
       somewhere, HE’S HERE! Bringing truth to the Bride. What’s it doin? He’s gathering his
       subjects together making the word of God so plain to them to a little group of people that it will
       bring down the great kingdom of heaven upon them. The word of truth has been revealed. Ye
       shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.
        The Holy Ghost has been loosed by the seven seal mysteries upon the book. Is that right!
       John 8:32-Reference quote:
       32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

       William Branham
       59 Now, these people are—are…Peter is saying here how that we must be partakers of His
       Divine nature. Now, each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of God.
       60 Now, after we get through with the Seven Seals, then at that time of the sounding of the Seven
       Seals, or the loosening... 'Course, we know what a Seal is; IT'S TO LOOSE A MINISTRY, to
       loose Seven Seals. And we'll see that right on the chart. IT'S LOOSENING A MESSAGE,
       SOMETHING THAT'S SEALED UP. 61 Last Sunday night, I preached on, “The Key.” And
       the key is faith. The faith holds the key, and the key is the Scripture. And CHRIST IS THE
       DOOR. See? SO FAITH TAKES THE LITTLE HINGES OF THE SCRIPTURE AND
       UNLOCKS THE GLORIES AND GOOD OF GOD, OUT TO HIS PEOPLE. SEE? SO, IT’S,
       FAITH HOLDS THE KEY THAT UNLOCKS CHRIST TO THE PEOPLE; UNLOCKS IT,
       REVEALS IT. 62 So, today, we’re going to try to take that same key, to unlock the way to
       become a virtuous Christian in the stature of God, that, and be a living Tabernacle for the
       living God to dwell in. 63 Remember, God reveals Himself in three ways. FIRST TIME, HE
       REVEALED HISSELF IN A PILLAR OF FIRE, that was called the Fatherhood. THEN
       THAT SAME GOD, MADE MANIFESTED IN JESUS CHRIST, WHICH HE BUILT A
       BODY, MADE THIS BODY. THIRDLY, THROUGH THE DEATH OF THAT BODY, HE
       SANCTIFIED A CHURCH THAT HE CAN DWELL IN. It was God above us; God with us;
       God in us; the same God.

       326 Here, our nation, saying the things they are, and making fun of these things, and their own
       money, their currency, testifies that the seal of the whole universe is God. See that eye standing
       up there above that, on that dollar bill? That’s the great seal. 327 It never was put on top of the
       pyramid. They couldn’t understand why. THE CAPPING STONE WAS REJECTED, THE
       HEAD, CHRIST. BUT IT WILL COME, SOMEDAY. 328 Now, in building, the
       virtue…Building this monument, building this stature, see, it starts off with the foundation
       stone; faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness. Now what
       does it do? Then they’re waiting for the Headstone, which is love, for God is love. And He
       controls, and He is the strength of every one of these things. That’s right. Yes, sir. 329 Right in
       here, right in here, you see I got, in between, all these works in here, and here these little waves
       come. What is that? THE HOLY GHOST COMING DOWN, THROUGH CHRIST, SEE.
       HOLY SPIRIT! The Holy Spirit is above all this, welding this together, building (a what?) a
       perfect Church, for the Capstone to cap It off.

       bumble bee flies in, get his part. The honey bee flies and gets his. The bypasser gets his, and
       everything. He toils, day and night, to keep his radiance. And the Gospel minister does the same
       thing; WALKS IN THE LINE OF GOD. HOLDS HIS TESTIMONY TRUE, THAT THE
       WORLD MIGHT PARTAKE OF HIM, see, Mr. Pastor Lily. He’s a good one. JESUS SAID,
       “CONSIDER HIM. Solomon is not like him.” That’s right. Dr. Lily, I guess you all know him.
       See? 191 “Consider the lilies of the field, how they toil and spin, neither. I say, and, yet,
       Solomon, all of his glory…” A lily has to struggle, day and night, to get the radiance to keep his
       garments, to keep the perfume and things going. And others…HE JUST OPENS UP
       HISSELF, AND THEY COME BY AND TAKE IT OUT OF HIM. The bee and the fly, and

        Brother Branham said, when that seven-seal mystery starts, nobody would know nothing
       about it, it’ll be a total secret. It’ll just start across the earth and that’ll be it. Nobody won’t know

       And in Sabino Canyon, He said, “This is the Third Pull.” 300 And there’s three great things
       that goes with It. And one unfolded today, or, yesterday; the other one unfolded today; and
       there’s one thing that I cannot interpret, because it’s in an unknown language. But I stand right

       knocks on the pulpit three times—Ed.] And the Holy Spirit of God…Oh, my! That’s the reason
       all Heaven was silent. 301 Now, I—I better stop right here, see. I just—I just feel checked, not to
       say no more about It. See? 302 So, just remember, the Seventh Seal, the reason It was not
       opened. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit six times—Ed.] See, the reason It did not reveal
       It, no one should know about It. 303 And I want you to know, before I even knowed any Word
       about That, that vision come years ago. You remember that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—

       179 So I’ve watched for something. Has it slipped by us in humility and we’ve missed it? Is it
       gone and the church is left in her sins? If that be so, then it’s later than you think. If not, then
       THERE’S COMING ONE WITH A MESSAGE THAT’S STRAIGHT ON THE BIBLE, AND
       QUICK WORK WILL CIRCLE THE EARTH. THE SEEDS WILL GO IN NEWSPAPERS,
       READING MATERIAL, UNTIL EVERY PREDESTINATED SEED OF GOD HAS HEARD
       IT. None of them will come unless the Father has drawed them, and every one the Father has
       drawed will hear It and come. That’ll be, the predestinated Seed will hear the Word.
       
       
        You say well, Brother Branham… No, he’s resting right there, he finished his labor he ain’t
       comin back laboring anymore, he’s resting in his rocking chair this morning. He’s not mourning
       there, no mourning there anytime. But he’s right there in his chair, in that ole Morris chair,
       
       119
       sitting there resting. And he’s not comin back until the whole resurrection sets in. And he’s
       gonna come back and pick up that ole carcase that’s laying down there in Jeffersonville on
       eighth and Tenth Street Cemetery. But there is gonna be a wave that pass over that grave. And
       when he comes up out of there, it ain’t gonna be the carcase that he had. He’s gonna have all of
       his hairs on his head and he’s gonna have every wrinkle out of his face, see. He’s not comin up
       the way they think he’s comin up. Not only he’s comin up but everyone that died in faith in
       every age is comin up with him. And brother I tell you, that when they come up they’ll be a
       ministry on earth brother that’ll shake the whole universe by the power of God. Big enough to
       call them out of the graves. BECAUSE THE VOICE OF THE RESURRECTION IS NONE
       OTHER THAN THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, JESUS CHRIST. HE’S THE
       RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. And though they we’re dead yet shall they live and hear the
       Voice of the Son of Man and live. That’s how it’s gonna come, it’s not gonna come the way they
       think. It’s gonna come with the word of God, it’s not gonna come contrary to the word, It’s
       gonna come contrary to their interpretations to the message, but right with the word.

       62 I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD IS MOVING INTO A
       SPHERE NOW THAT’S GOING TO SHAKE THE WHOLE WORLD. That’s the first time it’s
       been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being. “Ask anything that you will, and it
       shall be given unto you, anything you desire.” Don’t you see the words of Jesus Christ being
       fulfilled? Oh, it’s going to come to pass pretty soon. I’m looking for it to happen in this meeting.
       I’m wanting it to happen now, that that anointing will strike the whole church of the living
       God, and she’ll rise to her feet like a mighty marching army. The sick will be healed by a
       word; the blind will see; the deaf will hear; the dead will be raised up; and the power of God
       will shake the world with the church of the living God. We’re in the process of it now. I believe
       it’s soon coming to pass. I believe it will be just exactly that way. I believe it’s going to strike
       the church of God soon, and it’s going to start a revival that’ll shake the world. I believe it.
       
       
        The next thing in order is the coming of the kingdom nothing else. Thank God to.
       All right let’s look a here. Do you see John, do you see Ezekiel? Do you see John seeing the
       same thing that Ezekiel saw? Do you see the little book that was written within and on the
       outside? All right here he is now, verse 8…
        Don’t worry, don’t worry children, if I didn’t know what I was talking about I sure wouldn’t
       be talkin like this. Everything is well all is all right. It’ll be just exactly the way that I’m telling
       you, and no other way. Some say, “I’m getting' nervous I’m afraid it won’t be right.” Well, it
       will! It will! No man…No man could talk like that for four years, unless he heard something and
       I’m not sayin my words, I’m sayin his words. I speak of him, if I come speakin of myself then
       I’d be a liar. But I come speakin of another, another.

       Revelation 10:8-Scripture Reading;
       8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little
       book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
        “And the Voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again. Now watch this now! And
       said, go and take the little book which is open,” which is now open.
        Now notice over here in Revelation 5, the seven-seal book said he sat on the throne a book
       written within… Let’s turn your bibles…
        Are you in a hurry? (No) Something, I feel something pressin' I feel I ought to hurry, hurry
       and get out you know. Hard tellin' what the Lord reveal…hard to tell what happen… you know I
       say this is the truth, it’s true. You know we’re a people that, we got to have dinner at 12:30, we
       got to have dinner at one o’clock and then we got to have dinner at six o’clock whether we’re
       hungry or not. You know I don’t think we ought to eat till we’re hungry. Hungry eat whether one
       o’clock or two o’clock, but we got to have service this way and that way. See that ought not to
       be, we ought to just follow the leading of the Lord. And that’s what cramped the holy spirit in
       Brother Branham’s ministry. Said, you’re in too big of a hurry. If you could only be patient and
       wait upon the Lord. He don’t get in no hurry.
       Revelation 5:1- Scripture Reading:
       1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the
       backside, sealed with seven seals.
        Who is this? This is the Lord God almighty. The same one that Ezekiel saw the Lord sitting
       upon his throne in his glory.
        Now of all things for him to have in his hand. Now he could of had lots of things in his hands.
       You know a lot of times we have a lot of things in our hands. We have fishing poles in our hand,
       we have wrenches in our hand, we have garden hoses in our hand, we have pots and pans in our
       hand. Right! We have steering wheels in our hand; we have our wife by the hand.
        But you know here’s one that sat on the throne had something greater than all that, he had a
       little book in his hands. I’m glad he had a little book in his hands. I’m glad for the little book! He
       sat on the throne he had a little book in his hands. And written within and it’s written within
       from Geneses to Revelation. And on the backside, it’s sealed with Seven Seals. It’s got
       something on the inside and it’s got something on the backside.
       Revelation 5:2-9-Scripture Reading;
       2 “And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book,
       and to loose the seals thereof?
       3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book,
       neither to look thereon.
       4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to
       look thereon.
       5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda,”
       
       121
        Boy, this was a serious thing wasn’t it! If the book hadn’t been open then the resurrection
       wouldn’t of set in. Children listen close, the reason the prophet wept was, the reason that this
       prophet John wept is because, the one that’s sittin on the throne, if he couldn’t find some man to
       open this book that was worthy to take the book out of the hand of God the Lord sittin upon the
       throne, then all the dead that had died in faith was gonna stay in the grave. Including John! He
       could never come back to earth and get his resurrected body. He’s doomed and the earth was lost
       and it would have to be sent into nothing. He wept and he cried, don’t you know. I bet you could
       hear him scream a long way, he was groaning and screaming just agonizing travailing screaming
       and crying to God. Now wasn’t that a precious voice that said, weep not, don’t weep no more.
       Said, there’s one that’s gonna open the book. He said He’s worthy. There’s one that’s worthy to
       open the book John. Said, Honey said get up and patted him on the shoulder, get up John look I
       wanna show you something. Said, don’t weep no more. Said I know it just broke your heart,
       said, now I wanna tell you the rest of it. Said, there’s one worthy, said there’s one worthy. Said
       now look over here, he’s comin from over here. And a big voice cried out here said, What Look
       here! Behold the Lion of the tribe of Judea. What? The Lion of the tribe of Judea! What’s Judea
       guard? The eastern gate.
        What’s the birthstone of the Lion? (Astrology sign for July) Leo-July!

       46 And I said, “Somewhere in there, I had pointed out to me, one time in an observatory, the
       zodiac; beginning with the Virgin, coming over through the Cancer Age, AND ON DOWN
       UNTIL THE LAST WAS THE LION, LEO THE LION. THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST,
       BY THE VIRGIN; THE SECOND COMING, BY THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDA.”
       And I said, “I’ve tried my best to see that zodiac, and I can’t see it. But, yet, it’s there. Those
       who are trained, know it’s there. Job saw it. Men used to look at it. It was a Bible, at one day.
       But in that whole great mass of millions and billions of—of light years, God sits in the midst of
       all of it, and He looks down. Paul is in there. My mother is in there, somewhere, looking down.”

       of David, “hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
       6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of
       the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are
       the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
       7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
       8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down
       before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are
       the prayers of saints.”

       “But them that know their God shall do great exploits.” When will they do it Daniel? When this

       One hundred and twenty people finally believe that God was gonna pour out his spirit. Peter
       preaching on the kingdom of heaven coming, having the key to unlock… What is the kingdom of
       heaven? The holy ghost Baptism. Peter had the key to unlock the revelation to the people how to
       receive the holy spirit. He got them all in one mind and one accord and they stayed in the upper
       room there, right! Then suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind
       and filled the house and they we’re all filled with the Holy ghost. And out of there they went
       scattered into all the world with God. What happen? The holy ghost that fell on the first day
       WROTE THE BIBLE. The holy ghost that fell on them men of God back there WROTE THE
       BOOK. And now here we’re living in an hour and here we see in this day where the Christ has
       
       128
       come down by the Voice with the book open and is givin it out to the bride of Christ and they are
       eating that revelation. They are eating up what was wrote by the Holy Ghost that fell on the first
       day. Now the Holy Ghost is to fall on the eighth day gentile Bride and they go into all the world
       TO INTERPRET WHAT THEY WROTE. Think of it! The Holy Ghost that fell on the first day
       wrote the Bible and now the little book is open today. It was closed up, they wrote it but it was
       closed up. And now the Holy Ghost is interpreting the word of God to the elected Bride of Christ
       and then they are commissioned by another rushing wind by another Holy Ghost outpouring and
       then they go into all the world and they interpret what the other ones wrote. It ought to cause us
       to skip like a little ram on the mountain.
        Now notice here, here we go.

       as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.

       9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book.
       How many want the little book? “And he said” take it it’s yours.” eat it up; Now remember
       what it said about Ezekiel. “And it shall make thy belly bitter though, it’ll make your belly bitter.
       “but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.” Oh, that revelation will be sweet to those that eat
       the book. Alright!
       10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet

       11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and
       tongues, and kings.
        Notice that after the little book is eaten, after the prophet messenger is gone, after the little
       book is open. The little book is eaten and then is commissioned into all the world, to nations, to
       kingdoms, to peoples and tongues. Go ye now with the little book, that’s open. I’ve wrote my
       words upon your hearts; you’re written epistle known and read of all man. My early church
       wrote the bible now ye go and interpret it. You are my interpretation of the whole book. You are

       a wild man.” The church wasn’t able to receive it. That’s the pattern. Neither will the church
       receive it today. 204 BUT, TO THE ELECTED, GOD IS CALLING TO THE ELECTED.
       THEY KNOW IT: CALLING THE VIRTUOUS BRIDE, THE WORD, THE LAST-DAY
       CHURCH, THE ELECTED LADY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, WORD. If…Jesus is
       the Word. How many believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] All right. Then, the
       Bride is always part of the Bridegroom, so the Bride will not be a denomination. It’ll have to
       be the Word, manifested, to be the Bride of Christ. He promised to do it. He said how He did.
       
       130
       Never uses…loses His pattern. He always did it by the pattern. He done it, every time, by the
       pattern. HE DOES IT AGAIN, CALLING OUT HIS VIRTUOUS BRIDE IN THE LAST
       DAY, THE LOVELY REBEKAH WAITING FOR HER ISAAC. What a beautiful time!

       HIM. It had to be, ’cause, get the—get the elected. 71 What this is for is to get the elected
       people that’s coming out, like in the days of Noah. Like in the days of—of Elijah, the seven
       thousand or seven hundred, or whatever it was, that hadn’t bowed their knee, to call them out.
       JOHN CALLING OUT THE ELECTED, AND GIVE IT OVER TO CHRIST WHEN HE
       COME, SWAPPED HIS CHURCH, SAID, “I MUST DECREASE, HE MUST INCREASE,
       BECAUSE,” HE SAID, “I’M JUST A VOICE OF HIM, CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS,
       ‘PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE LORD.’” AND JESUS COME THE SAME WAY. GETS
       THE ELECTED READY TO HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD, THAT’S WHAT THE
       PROPHETIC SIGN IS. Oh, if you follow these Messages, get the per-…get the elected ready.

       some character in there that You dealt with, would be on the same basis that would be my
       question. If somebody done something, and—and You got after him about it, then let me turn to
       that place in the Bible. And if somebody, whatever they done, it’ll lean my way. Where I’ve done
       wrong, or something You want me to do, or haven’t done, let me see some character in the Bible
       like that.” 94 And I closed my eyes, just let the Bible fall open, put my finger on a Scripture,
       Genesis 24:7. ELIEZER, ABRAHAM’S FAITHFUL SERVANT, THE MODEL SERVANT
       OF THE BIBLE, BEING SENT TO HUNT THE BRIDE FOR ISAAC. CHILLS RUN OVER
       ME. SURE, THAT’S MY…THAT’S RIGHT WITH THE REST OF MY MESSAGE,
       PULLING OUT THE BRIDE. 95 He said, “Sware that you’ll not take a bride out of these, but
       go to my own people.” He said, “What if the woman won’t come with me?” 96 Said, “Then
       you’re free of this oath.” He said, “And the God of Heaven will send His Angel before you, to
       direct you.” He went right straight out and begin praying, and he met the beautiful Rebekah that
       become the bride of Isaac. 97 JUST A PERFECT MESSAGE, BACK TO THE WORD, “GO
       GET THAT BRIDE!” THAT’S A DUTY. THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR. THAT’S WHAT
       I’M TRYING TO DO, IS CALL OUT A BRIDE. 98 Remember in California there, that
       interview of the Bride, preview, I had it here. How that Bride come up first, and seen Her go by.
       Then here come Miss America, Miss Asia, and all, oh, the awfulest looking thing! And then the
       same Bride passed by again. One of them got out of step, and I was getting Her back in step; two
       of them, it was. AND THAT’S WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, KEEP THAT BRIDE IN
       STEP, HUNT THAT MAN. 99 I said, “God, I’m going back home, renew my vows again, and
       start out anew.” So that’s what we’re planning on doing, THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR.
        Now watch here, Brother Branham… You go home and read this, “Is Your life Worthy of the
       Gospel.” Brother Branham took the parable of the vineyard over there Mathew 19 somewhere in
       there. Took the parable of the kingdom and showed and said that there was another world wide
       shaking coming. He said there is another world-wide shaking coming. And you go home and
       take and read desperations also, look in the fly cover desperations. He spoke, “Thus saith the
       Lord, there’s coming something from the Lord and it’s gonna pass right through you, see.”
       Showing you there is another world-wide shaking coming from the Lord.

       is ready. There is still room.” And I believe, that, maybe, maybe within the next few months, or

       48 America, fifteen years ago, when the great healing revival continued on from pentecost, broke
       out in the nation, and there was a revivals on the capital, Washington, DC. The presidents, vicepresidents, great people, governors; great things taken place, governors and—and men were
       healed. Like, Congressman Upshaw had been a cripple for—for sixty-six years, and they could
       not turn their face and say it wasn’t so. It was right before them, but they turned It down. 49
       And, tonight, that’s the reason this nation stays. She is doomed. There is no hope for it, at all.
       She’s crossed the line between judgment and mercy. And she’s elected in what she has here, to
       control the nation. And she is rotten, to the core. Her politics is rotten. The morals of this nation
       is lower than anything I can think of. And her religious system is rottener than the morals. She
       becomes, in doing this, she has now joined herself, all these churches, and of the nation, into the
       federation of churches, and has taken the mark of the beast. What a thing! Why? Christ give
       them the opportunity, “Come to My feast,” the feast of pentecost, which means “fifty.” 50
       When the Holy Spirit poured out on Russia, they was called to a feast of pentecost, spiritual
       feast, and they turned It down. England, the Holy Ghost was poured out upon them, and they
       turned It down. America, the Holy Ghost was poured out upon them, and they’ve turned It down.
       51 He bid three times. Three times, He sent out, and they did not listen to the feast. THEN HE
       SENT AGAIN, AND HE SAID, “GO AND COMPEL THOSE PEOPLE TO COME. THE
       TABLE HAS GOT TO BE SET. THE TABLE IS READY. THERE IS STILL ROOM.” And I
       believe, that, maybe, maybe within the next few months, or something, or year, or whatever it
       is, GOD IS GOING TO SEND ANOTHER SHAKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, for there is
       somebody still out there, somewhere, that’s a predestinated Seed, that the Light has to fall on,
       somewhere, somewhere in the world. The nation, itself, is gone.
        Now just sit real quiet just a few minutes and try to see the picture that I’m trying to paint to
       you, that’s been givin to me by the Lord.
        Now notice here, Brother was told by the angel of the Lord that there was three hundred
       thousand of his children in India. I don’t remember the number three to four hundred thousand to
       five hundred thousand of his children in Africa. He said I sent to the assemblies of God three
       hundred and fifty thousand converts. I sent to United Pentecost two to three hundred thousand
       
       134
       converts. Brother Branham sent to the Baptist and to the Methodist and to some of those
       denominations thousands upon tens of thousands of Converts to Christ. Brother Branham sent
       about twenty to thirty maybe twenty-five thousand converts in Finland alone. Over ten thousand
       of his people and converts was at the airport praying and crying for him to stay in Finland. How
       many is that? Millions. And he said the third pull would go and get them. Now he said, what did
       it do, I went into all those great cities of the world and great nations of the world and shook
       Africa, shook India and he said, I didn’t have one preacher to follow up. And he said, I had to
       send my children back into them things that I called them out of.

       were, but they had clouts wrapped around them. They were praising God, and there was… It was
       in a field like. There was just so many people, that went back up over there, and a Light came
       down from heaven, a oscillating Light and went through there showing the people. And the
       Angel of the Lord called a number of them, and I heard the number: three hundred thousand.
       That would be six times the size of Durban’s meeting, where we had thirty thousand converts
       that day. I TRUST TO GOD, THERE’LL BE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WON TO
       CHRIST AT THAT DAY. BUT IT’S A COMING. IT MUST BE. I DON’T KNOW WHERE. I
       DON’T KNOW WHEN, BUT I KNOW IT WILL BE. 9 And you people setting here in this
       audience tonight, will hear of the meeting. Where it’ll be, I believe it’ll be in India. It looked like
       Indians to me. I could see them, and I was at the Durban meeting. I seen it going away into
       history, turning blue. I looked in front of me and there was still more people, thousands,
       greater than the first crowd was there. I believe I will be at Durban again. THEN HE
       TURNED TO THE LEFT AND I LOOKED, AND THERE WAS SO MANY PEOPLE,
       INNUMERABLE. Now remember, keep that on your mind. Write it on a piece of paper; lay it in
       your Bible; put it on the flyleaf somewhere. You’ll hear through the magazine: “Brother
       Branham had a meeting,” (somewhere in Orients, or down in India, I believe, or Africa,
       somewhere), “where three hundred thousand people attended the meeting.”
        And then what happen listen here, the preachers and leaders of those denominations when they
       saw that the people loved that man and that anointing and that spirit that was on him, they begin
       
       135
       to crucify in a roundabout way with little cutting statements. Like a, well yes that’s true that’s
       right, when Brother Branham is anointed, he is a prophet of God, but now when he teaches he’s a
       Beelzebub. But now said, just believe him to be God’s prophet while he prays for the sick but
       let’s not believe his message it’s of the devil. So, what did they do, little by little they pulled
       away the influence of the people that they had for Brother Branham?

       talk about their pastor, how just talk about him, run him down, ridicule him. How is that
       pastor ever going to do anything for you? He can’t do it. You—you don’t, you don’t re-…I don’t
       say this church, but I mean churches I have seen, that if you…You’ve got to love your pastor.
       You’ve got to know that he’s a human being, but yet God has made him His pastor. The Holy
       Ghost has made him overseer, then you’ve got to respect him in that manner. And no matter
       what the pastor’s done, if you respect him in your heart, as God’s servant, God will respect you
       for doing it. 166 “He that—he that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me,” Jesus said. “He
       that don’t receive Me, can’t receive Him.” See, they said God was their Father; He said,

       word through the true bride of Christ in her ministry, millions will come screaming out of the
       denominations. And it’ll be such a display of divine power and judgement because every
       minister that comes up against that, they’ll be stricken down right before the word.

       15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed
       is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
       16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:
       17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are
       now ready.
       18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a

       me excused.
       20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
       21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being
       angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither
       the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
       22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
       23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them
       to come in, that my house may be filled.

       288 Now, one thing more. Will you permit it to be said? Day before yesterday morning…You’ll
       notice on the—the board out there, a vision. I had a vision. It was about five o’clock, as my wife
       back there knows, or six. I had woke up. We got up to get the children ready to go to school. 289
       I just have these, now and then. And you all know, every one of you here, that they never fail.
       They, they are absolutely perfect. See? They never fail. 290 And I thought that I was the happiest
       person I ever seen. I was standing in the sun, s-u-n, and was—and was preaching the Gospel to a
       large, mammoth congregation. 291 [Brother Branham pauses—Ed.] I just wanted to see if it was
       
       137
       being taped. 292 A—a large, mammoth congregation, and they were setting in a forest. And
       streaks of the sun was shining down on them, just here and there, getting It, getting the Word.
       293 And I’m, as usual, always too long, too late, preach too long. And I preached so long, until
       the congregation become hungry for physical food. And they, some of them, got tired. So they
       just got up, went out to get them some food, started going out. I said, “Don’t. Don’t.” 294 I had
       two climaxes I wanted to meet, I wanted to meet, in my sermon. And the Lord had give it to me.
       And any preacher knows, when you really know it’s God has give it to you, you just burning to
       tell the people. 295 And I was just preaching, Charlie, just as hard as I could preach, just laying
       it on, you know, and say, “All these great things, this what God is doing. Look at this. He
       discerns the thoughts of the heart. What is It? The Word.” And go like that. And, oh, I wish I
       could remember what I would say and what my text was. I can’t think of it. See? But I was just
       preaching away. 296 And I was watching myself do it. And then when I was standing there,
       looking, and watching myself preach It. 297 And I was just preaching, to-who-wouldn’t-have-it.
       And after a bit, I raised up, you know, and I thought, “Glory to God!” I said, “Look at these
       wonderful things, and this, that!” 298 Directly, I noticed the people begin to get like they was
       physically hungry. And so they had enough spiritual, so they started walking away. And some
       of them…[Brother Branham yawns—Ed.] Started walking away. I thought, “What’s the
       matter with everybody?” 299 And—and I looked, and here some young couples going along, to
       my side. I THOUGHT…I SAID, “JUST A MINUTE, FRIEND! JUST A MINUTE! YOU’LL
       BE BACK AGAIN WHEN THE EVENING SHADOWS FALL.” SEE? I SAID, “YOU’LL BE
       BACK AGAIN. But let me give you this first climax. Where does all these things come from,
       that I’ve showed you? Where are they from?” I said, “Here they are. They are in the Word of
       God. They are THUS SAITH THE LORD, His promise. Cause,” I said, “all of you bear me
       record, witness this, that my commission is, ‘Stay with the Word.’” I said, “What’s the matter
       with all of you? Can’t you understand the Word? YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IT.” 300 And
       some of them said, “Man, I’d like to have some biscuits,” and so like that. 301 Well, I just
       thought, “Well, glory to God! If they want biscuits, let them go get them.” 302 So I—I turned
       around. I thought, “Oh, but, you know what? The shadows is going to fall, after while, right
       away.” I said, “Then, tonight, when that congregation gathers in again, I’ll put the climax to
       them, and told them that the things that they have seen me do is found in the Word of God, not
       in some mythical book or some organization. It’s found in the Word. See? Every bit of it, in the
       Word, ’cause I’m commissioned to That.” 303 I thought, “You know, they’ll, every one, be back
       tonight, so here is what I’ll do. I’ll background, kind of background.” You know the way I do it
       on these church ages and things, say what I said before. “I’ll background it, on the Word, and
       then THIS GREAT, MARVELOUS CLIMAX.” I said, “What a time it’ll be! Praise be to
       God!” And I seen myself getting real little, and heard that, “Praise be to God.” I seen myself
       fading up like that. And here I was, standing there. 304 Now, here is the interpretation thereof.
       See? The first thing that I have done, the things that’s been done, has been mystical to the
       people, most of them. I don’t mean the Full Gospel and saints of God, but, I mean, in most the
       people. And you never want to look at the world, kosmos, as the Message of God. When you go
       and you say… 305 Like Boze said, “I’ve always…” Said, “I had a dream, years ago, that the—
       the God would send me to Chicago and shake Chicago for the glory of God.” I said, “Joseph,
       He has already done it.” “Why,” he said, “they haven’t been shaken since Moody.” 306 I said,
       “That? I’m talking about the Church. That’s cannon fodder out there. That’s just dust of the
       earth, that bunch cramming through the streets, painted Jezebels and everything.” I said,
       “That’s out there. Them big old lodges and things will crumble and fall into the streets there.” I
       
       138
       said, “He is talking about the Church. The Church that seen the revelation of Jesus Christ
       made manifest, and they recognize It. They may not be fifteen out of Chicago. There may not
       be ten in this generation, out of the whole city of Chicago, come forth.” 307 Did you ever think
       of that? “As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the Coming of the Son of man, wherein
       eight souls were saved.” Uh-huh. How many come out of Sodom? See what I mean? I doubt
       being a handful. See? 308 But the Church Itself has received the shaking. They’ve recognized
       it. They knowed the Word. They seen the Word when It was being materialized, and they
       caught It. Now look at that for a minute, now. 309 And this first Message, when they’d see It,
       everybody rallied for It, said, “Oh, glory to God! Oh, if I could see this, that, and the other.”
       And they go right away, the same way they come in. See? 310 And now they think, “Well, I don’t
       know. Where would you join? If I don’t come to this, it’ll be this way. And I’ll be kicked out, over
       here, and I won’t have nothing to here.” Brethren set down and say, “Well, what would I do if
       I…?” See there? They won’t stop long enough to recognize It’s the Word that God promised,
       being manifested. See? And they walked away. 311 But, don’t worry, the shadows are close at
       hand, see, when I return to the field. 312 You remember, the other night, of the Message that He
       give me back there when I was laying the corner stone? Just exactly. Said, “Do the work…”
       Said, “When you come out of this vision, read Second Timothy 4.” You know, it’s laying right
       there in the cornerstone, thirty-three years ago. 313 Said, “Do the work of an evangelist, make
       full proof of your ministry. For the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine;
       but after their own lusts shall heap teachers, having itching ears; turn from fable…from
       Truth unto fables.” If that hasn’t been, just word by word! [Blank spot on tape—Ed.] 314 But,
       remember, then, the other night, when I never did read the rest of it. The thirty-something years
       that I’ve preached in this tabernacle, never one time did I ever go any farther than that, and I
       don’t know why. 315 I often wonder, till, one day, I seen where Jesus picked up the Scroll and
       begin to read, and read half of the prophecy, and stopped, and said, there in Capernaum, He
       said, “And this day, this prophecy is fulfilled.” Why didn’t He read the rest of it? IT
       PERTAINS TO HIS SECOND COMING. See?
       
        Be just like little Philip who had received the real goods at Pentecost and came up to Samaria
       and the bible said, he preached the name of Jesus Christ unto them and the kingdom of heaven.
       And said there was a great preacher there that was givin out that he was the great power of God.
       But Remember Hold it, Jesus Christ had already come through Samaria and preached the
       message of the second pull. Discerning the… Oh, this is coming fresh now. Discerning the
       secrets of the heart, the little women at the well discerning the secrets of the heart, that little
       convert went back to those denominations and said, come see a man that told me everything I
       ever done. Is this not the anointed one the Messiah? Oh, Children WHAT DID HE SAY TO
       HER? He said, if you knew who I was, if you knew the gift of God and who was speakin to thee,
       I’d of given you the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, living water. You’d never have to come to this
       denomination and draw from here again. Right! But went back and the preachers poisoned her
       mind and everything. But God never forgot the little women at the well. He never forgot what
       happen with the second pull with the women at the well. Was that the second pull? Sure, it was.
        Here come the kingdom of heaven on the day Pentecost, scattered them abroad preaching the
       word of God everywhere. He came a little man that wasn’t even an apostle or a prophet or
       evangelist and here he come up there. Here was Philip waitin on tables filled with faith and the
       power of God. He come there and he preached the name of Jesus Christ unto that place, he
       
       139
       preached the kingdom of Heaven. He cast out devils and healed the sick and raised the dead. And
       there was a man there a preacher an evangelist from a certain denomination name Simon. He was
       givin out that he was the great power of God. And it said he convinced all the city both great and
       small that he was the great power of God.
        But when Simon saw all of them converts leavin his meetings, when he saw Philip
       demonstrating the kingdom of heaven, ole Simon got so scared and convicted he repented and he
       was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and even tried to receive the token and
       couldn’t get it. And ole Peter said to him, when Simon couldn’t get the holy ghost and couldn’t
       duplicate what them men of God was doin in the kingdom.
        He said lookie here, I had a meeting over there and I got five hundred thousand out of that full
       gospel business meetin. He said, I’ll give it to you, if you’ll just give me this gift, that I can lay
       hands on people and they can receive the token like that. Peter said, you hypocrite you snake in
       the grass, you imposter you, you money beggar you. You think that the gift of God can be
       purchased with money, you better pray that God don’t strike you dead.
        You getting the picture! Here they come out of the denominations by the millions. Why? The
       bible said, the spirit of Mal 4 said come, come out of there, then I’ll be a father to you and then
       you’ll be a son and daughter to me. And what happen the rest of the scriptures said, and the little
       Bride say come. The spirit says come and the little bride says come, come what? COME OUT
       OF THAT THING! And when they did, they started coming out by the thousand and the millions
       and what’s that gonna do those that followed Brother Branham? Well, they’re gonna know there
       was a prophet in the land, they’re gonna know.
       Revelation 22:17-Reference quote:
       17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that
       is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 9 - The Laodicean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       Yes sir. The church is no longer the “mouthpiece” of God. It is its own mouthpiece. So
       God is turning on her. HE WILL CONFOUND HER THROUGH THE PROPHET AND
       THE BRIDE, FOR THE VOICE OF GOD WILL BE IN HER. Yes it is, for it says in the
       last chapter of Revelation verse 17, “THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY, COME.”
       ONCE MORE THE WORLD WILL HEAR DIRECT FROM GOD AS AT PENTECOST;
       but of course that Word Bride will be repudiated as in the first age.

       489 It goes right by them, and they don’t recognize it till it’s gone. It only picks up the
       predestinated Seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the earth. The same thing
       come through in the days of Noah, same thing come through in the days of Moses, days of
       Elijah, days of the prophets, days of Jesus, on down through and to this very hour. The
       pregnated person with the Seed of God, the Word in there manifesting Itself, so surrendered to
       the will of God that the Word, and the Word alone, manifests Itself in this person, the
       prisoner, to an individual. 490 Not say, “My church…” Now, “my church” has nothing to do
       with it. 491 It’s an individual, one person! All hell is against this Teaching. All hell is against
       this Truth, but it is the Truth. 492 Jesus never said, “Now, Peter, you and John, and all the rest
       the people, YOU’VE GOT THE REVELATION, NOW THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SAVED.”
       No. 493 It was to him, personally. “I say unto thee, thee,” not to them, “to thee, thou art Peter;
       upon this rock I’ll build My Church.” And the word Peter, means “a stone.” Stone means “the
       confessed one,” or, “the separated one.” 494 Upon a certain stone, upon a certain thing; see, a
       called-out, the Church called out; upon this stone, upon this “revelation.” “Flesh and blood
       never revealed it to you. But upon this revelation, called-out group, I’ll build My Church in
       them. And all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it.” 495 “Not one hair of your
       head shall perish. You are Mine! I’ll raise you up in the last day, give unto him Eternal Life,
       and raise him up at the last days.” There it is, the revelation. Not them; but “him,” an
       individual! Not a group; an individual! All hell is against it. 496 BUT HIS MYSTERY IS
       ONLY REVEALED TO HIS BELOVED BRIDE. THAT’S THE ONLY ONE COULD SEE
       IT.
        How many remember the white horse rider vision? What did that Voice say on there, cried
       out on that white horse which is the apostolic word and power. And that white horse was the
       apostolic church, apostolic word, apostolic power, pure white. There’s only one original color
       white and that was the original word that come forth in the days of the apostles, riding the trail.
       What? This religious trail down through here. And he rode up beside this evangelist and said,
       Get Off Of Here! God never ordained you to be a preacher! God hasn’t ordained you, get off of
       here. He said, it thundered and shook the earth. What is it? That’s the ministry of the Bride, the

       257 He said, “Mr. Branham, I realize I got to stand before God.” He said, “I don’t know
       whether I was asleep or what happened.” He said, “I dreamed. I’m going to say I was asleep
       and I dreamed.” 258 Said, “I thought my son, in the market, stuck his hand in a—a sack.” And
       said, “When he did, it was a sack of apples, and they all turned over.” Said, “When I went to
       pick them up, they was all green apples with one bite taken out of them.” Said, “I was picking
       them up, put them back in the sack.” Said, “Some of them rolled out, and rolled down, so I went
       to try to get them, and under…on the grass.” And said, “They rolled under one of these
       chainlock fences. And there was a big super highway run in there. I looked back east, and,” he
       said, “the—the—the chain was hooked against a—a big rock back in the east. And I went back
       there, and thought I’d let this chain down, then go over and get the apples for the man.” Said, “I
       started to let the chain down.” 259 Said, “A voice shook the whole earth.” Said, “The earth
       shook, from under my feet.” And said, “After it quit shaking, I heard a voice.” And said,
       “Brother Branham, it was your voice,” said, “I knowed; there was something said that.” Said—
       said, “It said, ‘I’ll ride this trail once more!’” 260 And said, “I started looking up the rock, like
       this, and looked on, in a past the clouds. And way up there, standing on a rock that reached from
       the east to the west, in a pointed shape like that, like a pyramid, run back here to the east, and,”
       said, “there you were standing there, on a horse that I never seen anything like it in my life;
       great white horse, white mane hanging down.” And said, “You was dressed like an Indian chief,
       with all the things the Indians use.” Said, “He had a breastplate; them bangles on the arms, and
       all down around like that.” Said, “You had your hands up like that.” And said, “That horse
       standing there like a military horse, with a prance like this, walking,” me standing still. And
       said, “You pulled on the reins, went riding off towards the west.” 261 Said, “I looked down
       there, and there was a whole lot of scientists.” And the next morning…That was Saturday. On
       the next morning, I preached on scientists, you know, being of the devil. And said, “Scientists
       there were pouring things in tubes, and mixing it.” Said, “You stopped the horse, raised up your
       hands again and screamed, ‘I’ll ride this trail once more!’” And said, “The whole earth shook.
       Them people shook,” said, “looked up and looked at one another, like that, and looked up to
       you. They just shrugged their shoulders, went on with their scientific research.” And said, “You
       started going on towards the west. 262 “And when it did,” said, “I seen this man that called
       himself a prophet, you know,” said, “he come up on a horse that was mixed with white and black
       together.” And said, “He got up behind this great big horse.” Said, “It was,” said, “way up
       above the clouds, and the road wasn’t over about that wide.” And said, “That horse just danced,
       to the wind blowing the feathers and everything on—on your garb,” and said, “then the horse
       mane and tail blowing. Great master, big white horse, walking right in line.” And said—and
       said, “This guy ran up behind you, come from towards Canada,” and the man lives in Canada.
       And he said, “Come back, and,” said, “he took his little horse, trying to knock your big horse
       off; turning him around; make his hips hit against the…” Said, “It never moved the big horse; he
       just kept walking.” 263 Said, “Then, all of a sudden,” said, “you turned around.” Said, “That
       would be the third time you had spoke, but the second time you said ‘I’ll ride.’” And said, “You
       didn’t speak like you did. You commanded.” Said, “You turned around and called the man by
       name, and said, ‘Get off of here! You know that no man can ride this road here without God
       be ordaining him to do it. Get off of here!’” 264 And said, “The man turned around.” And said,
       
       142
       “The man has wrote me letters.” And said, “Across his horse’s hips,” that black and gray, and
       mixed up together, said, “across his horse’s hips was wrote his name, signature just exactly like
       is on his letter. And he rode off towards the north.” 265 Said, “Then you went on down; that big
       horse turned around, way as far west as you could.” Said, “You stood and raised your hands up
       like that.” Then he started crying. Said, “Brother Branham, to see that horse standing there; all
       that war bonnet and everything like that, and,” said, “that breastplate and everything shine.”
       Said, “You held your hands up a little while.” And said, “You looked down again, picked up the
       reins, said, ‘I’ll ride this trail just once more!’” Said, “The whole earth shook back and forth,
       like that.” And said, “There was no more life left in me; I just fell down aside of the rock.
       Then I woke up.” Said, “What does it mean, sir?” I said, “I don’t know.”
        What happens, now here can you see… Can you see a…O.R. (Oral Roberts) great evangelist
       can you see T.L. (TL Osborn), Can you see JM? Can you see D.D. (David Duplass’s.) D.D.
       Demos shakarian is convinced that the wrath of God fell on Brother Branham. You ought to read
       that sickening letter he wrote. Friend I wish I could tell you how the Lord feels about it. I heard
       the spirit cry out and call them’s men names. I’d rather be a John Dillinger then be one of them
       men. I ain’t mad at nobody. But your gonna see in a little bit what happens. Here they are, they
       wouldn’t hear him. They wouldn’t hear him, they forgot all about him, they never shed a tear.
       They never laid on their face and weeped cried to see one of the days of Elijah again. But those
       that loved him do, those that love him haven’t forgot. Jesus hasn’t forgot.
        Now when this great third pull the revealed word the little book has been eaten by the Bride
       of Christ, when she goes out in this last move of God to the gentiles and begin to call all of Gods

       Branham had that dream about Brother Borders had scales over his eyes he said, Brother Borders
       SNAP OUT OF THAT! Oh, brother Branham it’ll take more than what’s here now to do it! He
       said, oh please brother Borders snap out of that. And he looked over there and he seen all those
       people in prison house, nice people in prison houses and a Voice spoke out of Heaven said,
       “Deliver them people.” He said, “My God, I ain’t strong enough to pull them bars. But Lord my
       muscles ain’t big enough to break them bars down. Then something came upon me and I said,
       And the Gates of Hell in the name of Jesus Christ give way.”
       And he said, there come such a shakin' and a rumbling and cracking and all them houses begin to
       crumble apart. And I was running and I said, Brother Borders, where are you? Brother Borders,
       where are you? God is delivering his people. There’s your third pull. How many believe God’s

       65-1126 - Works Is Faith Expressed
       William Branham
       24 I had a dream, the other morning. I don’t dream very often, I’m not a dreamer. But I—I
       dreamed that I seen a man, a young fellow in shackels, and he was trying to get out, and—and I
       said…Somebody told me, said, “Those are horrible people, don’t have nothing to do with them.”
       25 And I seen this young fellow getting out of his shackel so I just let him alone. I thought, “I’ll
       just see what he does.” So when he got out, he was a nice fellow. And I seen others trying to get
       
       143
       out. 26 Now, this is only a dream. And I walked over this way and I seen a—a brother, Roy
       Borders, a very good friend of mine, lives in California. Looked like there’s something wrong,
       his eyes was half closed, and great big…maybe cancer or something over his eyes. And
       I…someone was trying to pull me away from him. I screamed, “Brother Borders! In the Name
       of the Lord Jesus, snap out of that!” 27 And he just barely could speak, saying, “Brother
       Branham, it’ll have to take something more than this. I just can’t grasp it, Brother Branham. I
       just can’t grasp it.” 28 I said, “O Brother Borders.” I love him. 29 And someone pulled me
       away, and I looked, and it was a lady standing over here that I, when I was a little boy, I—I used
       to haul groceries from the grocery store to the peoples. And her name was Mrs. Fenton, she lives
       in Jeffersonville yet, a personal friend to the wife and I. 30 And she said, “Brother Branham,
       deliver us from this.” Said, “This is a house of hell.” And said, “You’ve been misunderstood.”
       And said, “These…And you—you misunderstood these people, too.” Said, “These are fine
       people, but…” And I looked over there, and like a great big cellar, or—or big walls, down
       beneath a great big cave; and great iron bars, eight or ten inches thick. And people, out of their
       mind, twisted arms and legs, beating their head like that. And she was crying, saying, “Deliver
       the people, Brother Branham.” Said—said, “Help us, we’re in trouble.” She herself, I know her,
       she belongs to the…I believe the church of Christ, or the Christian church, called Church of the
       Brethren. So she… 31 I looked around, and I said, “I wished I could.” And go on, looking
       around; and I…my little, bitty body and—and them great, big iron bars; and those poor people
       in there. And you couldn’t get to them, them iron bars was setting close together. And I looked,
       and they were beating their head like they were out of their mind. 32 And I seen some lights
       flickering around in there. And I looked up, and there stood the Lord Jesus with a—a—a lights
       of rainbow around Him. He was looking right straight to me, said, “Deliver those people.”
       And He went away. 33 And I thought, “Well, how could I deliver them? I—I haven’t got
       strength enough in my arms to break those bars.” 34 So I said, “House of hell, give away to the
       Name of Jesus Christ.” 35 And all the creaking and popping, and—and rocks rolling, and—
       and bars falling; and people running, screaming, “Delivered!” and screaming at the top of
       their voice, and was all delivered. 36 And I was screaming then, “Brother Roy Borders, where
       are you? Where are you? God is delivering His people! Where are you, Brother Borders?” I’ve
       wondered about that. 37 You know, Brother Borders is very scared. You know the prophecy,
       all…many of you do, you take the tapes and so forth, about the West Coast. 38 There’s men
       setting right here, tonight, that was there when that happened (when we were standing there, on
       a hunting trip), a minister who was listening in last night. With a blinded eye, he just come up
       there and he said…introduced himself. He had on colored glasses, up in the mountain. He said,
       “Brother Branham,” said, “I’m Brother McHughes.” He said, “I—I helped sponsor one of your
       meetings once, in California.” 39 I said, “I’m glad to know you, Brother McHughes.” 40 So
       there was about twenty man standing there. We was out javelina hog hunting. And I said, the day
       before going up the mountain, I said to Brother Banks Wood…All of you know him, a personal
       friend. I said, “Brother Wood,…” Picked up a rock and threw it up in the air, and it came down.
       And I said, “THUS SAITH THE LORD, something’s fixing to happen.” 41 So, he said, “What
       is it, Brother Branham?” 42 I said, “I don’t know, but within twenty-four hours you’ll see.
       Something’s fixing to happen. That’s a great sign.”
        So now what about, OR, TL and JM, AA, and DD? (ministers initials of their names that
       rejected the message of Brother William M. Branham)

        I want to read one verse of scripture in closing. I’ll show you what’s gonna happen to them.
       Let’s read in Luke 13 in closing. Do you get the picture painted there? Now you see it? Now
       here they are, the second pull was like prophesy like the women at the well. Look at Philip went
       back up there and got her and Peter come up there and laid hands on the women at the well and
       she was filled with the Holy Ghost. How many say amen? (amen)
        A hundred and twenty got it when he come and brought the Kingdom of heaven the first time.
       And then they brought the Kingdom out of heaven out of Jerusalem. Philip… watch here, just
       waitin on tables filled with the holy ghost and faith but he knew that he was an evangelist
       because when he got his inheritance up in the upper room the Lord said, Philip you’re my
       evangelist. I’m gonna use you, said but now you be faithful in all things. Peter and John, said
       pick you out some men filled with the Holy Ghost and faith to wait on tables, Philip was one of
       them. See how faithful he was, there he was a great man, but there he just humbled himself to
       wait on tables. And there it was, and when it come time said… the spirit said, Philip go up to
       Samaria, said I got some converts up there Philip… that was the Holy Ghost was speakin there.
       Said, Philip I got some converts up there that I won by my second pull when I discerned their
       hearts, said their up she’s still up there, they’re still up there. Huh! And what did she do? She
       went into the city and brought a whole bunch of people back with her. Huh!
        How many see the picture? The Kingdom of heaven come to Jerusalem and then Philip who
       had the kingdom of heaven in him, he took the kingdom of heaven up to Samaria. And when the
       Kingdom of heaven got up to Samaria, did it not manifest the folly of that preacher up there that
       was givin out that he was the great power of God? (Amen)
        Did not the Bible say, as these preachers with stood Moses Jannes and Jambres, they’ll
       withstand thee in the truth. Reprobate of corrupt minds concerning the truth. But said, their folly
       shall one day be manifested unto all. They’re gonna know their folly.
       2 Timothy 3:4-8-Reference quote:
       4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
       5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
       6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with
       sins, led away with divers lusts,
       7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
       8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt
       minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

       142 You can’t mix two or three different ministries together, pastor and evangelize, the same
       time. You can’t be a—a prophet and maybe a pastor, at the same time, see, ’cause you have
       different works, different ministry. 143 But the Lord gave me what I should do in my Message.
       But then He said, “Do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry, for the hour
       will arrive when they will not endure sound Doctrine.” If that hasn’t come now! Every church
       denomination has turned me down. They wouldn’t endure sound Doctrine. “But after their
       own lusts they’ll bring their own teachers in, and they’ll be turned into fables. And they will do
       
       145
       great things of exploit like Jambres and Jannes that withstood Moses, but their folly will be
       made manifest.” See? See? All right, impersonations! You see how Jambres…
       
        Now they think the ole crank Elijah is gone now and the church has got peace and they can
       live anyway they want to. Trample over Gods truth but the message is gonna live again.

       334 These things wasn’t done in a corner, friend. Remember, “Strait is the gate and narrow is
       the way, and but few there’ll be that will find it.” Don’t go with that crowd that’s moving on
       yonder, friend, that Laodicea Church Age. It could jump up-and-down, dance under music,
       lukewarm. Didn’t say it was ice cold, now, it said it was lukewarm, that’s the Pentecostal, and
       don’t know that it’s miserable, wretched, blind. Blind to what? The Word, to the manifestation
       of the Word; because It never come through their organizations, they cannot receive It. 335
       And you ministers down there in Tucson, tonight, I don’t hold you responsible for that. God does.
       I was there for three years. I told you I wouldn’t start a church. I didn’t. Brother Pearry Green
       started it. I was there three years, and not one time did you invite me to your pulpit. I set in
       Tucson for nearly three years. GOD WILL TAKE ME FROM THE DESERT ONE OF
       THESE DAYS. THIS MESSAGE MUST LIVE. I tried my best to get in to you. I—I know the
       reason you did it. You hear? Only reason you did it, your denomination would kick you out.
       And you know, many of you I’ve talked to, there at Furr’s Restaurant, and you know it’s the
       truth. Shame on you. 336 Come out of it. Get out of there, brother. If there’s any Life in you,
       you’ll be like that little eagle I just spoke of, you’ll hear the Word of God. Remember, you’re
       going to hear This for the last time, one of these days. We’re real close now. Won’t you come,
       tonight? 337 Dear God, we set solemnly now, a thanksgiving day it really is, Lord. I am
       grateful, Lord, to be living in this day. This is the greatest day. Paul the apostle longed to see
       this day. The great men of old longed to see it. The prophets longed to see it. They looked for
       this day. Abraham looked for this day, for he sought for a City whose Builder and Maker was
       God; it hangs right above us, tonight. John seen the Spirit of God descending out of Heaven,
       bore record, knowed that that was the Son of God. And, think now, He’s choosing His Bride.
       
       
       146
        All right now, you see the second pull, brother Branham said the third pull goes back and get
       the converts of the second pull.
        Now let’s look and read Luke 13:24 here.
       Luke 13:24-28-Scripture Reading Ad-Lib;
       24 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,” Very many I say will seek to
       enter in, and shall not be able.
       25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to
       stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer
       and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: What? I don’t know you! Who are you?
        Now I’m gonna paraphrase this as you read your Bible and I’m gonna talk to you here inbetween the lines.
        Alright now it says, “Strive to enter in at the strait gate.” We know that’s the Token, we know
       that’s the true Baptism of the Holy Ghost, strait is the way. Now notice it said, when the Bride
       the elected Bride begins to enter into the Ark which is Jesus Christ the body Gods house.
       Coming by the door, there’ll come a time when the master of the house will rise up and shut the
       door to the top of the Ark. The door is on top of the Ark. Not one person could come into the
       Ark after the door was shut. God shut the door.
        Now notice, when the Lord shuts the door of the house and has risen up, see. Now here’s the
       throne the blood, here’s where the blood really leaves the mercy seat. There’s no more mercy
       then. The Gentiles door is closing now, see. And has shut the door and ye begin to stand without,
       and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto
       you, I know you not whence ye are: Now they knew him! They knew the Lord, but he didn’t
       know them. They knew the Lord, but he didn’t know them. He wouldn’t recognize them.
       
       Luke 13:26-28-Ad Lib Scripture;
       26 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in
       our streets.
       27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of
       iniquity.
       28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and
       Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.
        Now watch here in verse 25. 26 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy
       presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. 27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not
       whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
        All right, OR, TL, JM and DM and all the rest of you preachers if they was here and I could
       tell them this morning, that have set in the audience and seen that man of God (William
       Branham) and that Pillar of light come in beside of him and know that his voice begin to speak
       and tell people their names where they was from what was the matter with them. Thus, saith the
       Lord your healed and see all them miracles, all them healings and all them great wonders done
       by the presence of the Lord Jesus, Hebrews 13:8, Hebrews 4:12, “The word of God discerner of
       the secrets of the heart.” It’s only the word of God that discern the secrets of the heart. And they
       sat there, OR, TL, JM, DD and a host of thousands of other preachers and their congregation and
       set there in the presence of the Son of Man. Meeting after meeting year after year. How about
       
       147
       JM in Shreveport, if ever want to find him with Brother Branham he’s down there if he wasn’t
       there, he’s over the Philadelphian Church in Chicago. Said, “He says my friend!” Is he? Ain’t
       even man enough to stand up for baptism in Jesus name and never cried one tear at the funeral.
       Hebrews 13:8-Reference quote:
       8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
       Hebrews 4:12-Reference quote:
       12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing
       even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner
       of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
        I was sitting in the room back there and I was so torn up in the audience and I set there and
       cried and him and some other big fat preacher set there and talked about their meetings and
       everything and all during the funeral. It’s a wonder the wrath of God had never struck them both
       dead. It’s all I could do to bite my tongue. I started to say something and I just had to force
       myself to keep still, had an awful time not sayin something there. And they say that they loved
       him? HOW COULD MEN RESIST SUCH A PRECIOUS MAN OF GOD? HOW COULD
       THEY RESIST SUCH A PRESENCE AROUND A MAN LIKE THAT? What about you? What
       about you preachers? After you’ve set in the presence of the Son of Man!
        Did you know that when that second pull went out, it went out into the streets? LOOK AT
       YOUR BIBLE! WHEN THAT SECOND PULL WENT OUT, IT WENT OUT INTO THE
       STREETS!
       Luke 14:21-Reference quote:
       21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house
       being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
       bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
        But when the Third PULL IT WENT OUT INTO THE HIGHWAY AND HEDGES AND
       A VOICE WAS NOT CRYIN IN THE STREETS ANY MORE.
       Luke 14:22-24-Reference quote:
       22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
       23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them
       to come in, that my house may be filled.
       24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.

       the hedges, and highways, and byways, get the lame, halt, and blind, and compel them to come
       in. For God is determined that His table will not be set, and there’ll be nobody there. God wants

       judgement.” You better look in your bible again, this is right here on earth when this takes place.
       That ain’t over at the white throne judgement, that’s right here!
        What happen? When the elected Bride come out in her revival and begin to receive the great

       would take me another two hours, but it’s right over there. It’s right over there and he knows all
       about it, and always knowed about it. It’s right in the word of God.
        And here it is, the great power of God demonstrated in the bride and all of his converts
       comin' out and shakin' them, they’re shakin' to their feet. Then what do they do? Then they
       begin to humble themselves down when they see they can’t stay with that spoken word that
       creative power of God. They duplicated all those gifts of healing and everything. But here
       something comes on the scene that they can’t imitate, and it begins to get world-wide attention

       Second Peter, that it was “the teaching of Balaam” that Israel received, that God never did
       forgive. Unpardonable sin! Not a one of them got saved, though they had come out under the
       blessings of God, and seen the hand of God moving by this mighty prophet, and seen it exactly
       vindicated by God. And, because, another prophet come in with a teaching, contrary, and
       disputed with Moses, and tried to prove to the people that Moses was wrong. And Dathan,
       Korah, and many of them, agreed with him and taught the children of Israel to commit
       fornications, to go after his organization, that, “We’re all the same.” “Whether we’re Methodist,
       Baptist, Presbyterian, or Pentecostals, and what-more, we’re all the same.” 69 We are not the

       227 Remember, they were very religious people that did that. They wasn’t outsiders. They were
       religious people of that day. And that’s what’s doing it today, is the religious people; same
       crucifixion, same thing today. Quickly… 228 “There they crucified Him,” then, then. Sure.
       Then they were rejecting God’s Word made manifest, accepting their creeds instead of the
       Word. 229 Is that what they’re doing today? That’s exactly, doing the same today. He was the
       Word; and they rejected the Word. That’s one point I want you not to miss, see, I want you not
       to miss. He was the Word, and when they rejected Him, they rejected the Word. And when they
       did reject Him, they finally crucified Him. And that’s what they’ve done today: reject the Word
       of God, and accepted their creeds; AND HAS CRUCIFIED, PUBLICLY, BEFORE THEIR
       CONGREGATION, THE WORKING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. And they’re guilty, and I
       indict them in the Name of Jesus Christ. 230 FIFTEEN YEARS I’VE SEEN HIM MOVE
       ACROSS THE LAND, AND STILL THEY HOLD THEIR CREEDS. They’re guilty! They
       took the Word that would have brought the church, all the churches together, and made a
       great big union brotherhood amongst Pentecostals and all the rest of them; instead of doing
       so, THEY REJECTED IT, AND TURNED IT DOWN, HAS MADE FUN OF IT, AND
       CALLED IT EVERYTHING NOW. 231 And now, by a federation of church, through the devil’s
       plan, trying to come in and say, “Now we’ll come, buy some Oil.” They are rejected. And
       they’ve…They are guilty of crucifying Jesus Christ. You take it on God’s terms, or your terms
       won’t work. See? 232 They rejected God’s Word made manifest, for their creeds, and they’re
       doing the same today. “He was the Word,” John, Saint John 1. Hebrews 13:8 says, “He’s the
       same yesterday, today, and forever.” Now they are crucifying Him afresh. 233 Did you know
       the Bible said we could do that? How many would like to read just a little bit? Will you give me
       another fifteen minutes of it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] All right. Let’s turn over now,
       just a minute, a “crucified afresh.” Let’s go over to Hebrews, the 6th chapter, and read just a
       little bit. Hebrews the 6th, and see if we “crucify the Son of God afresh,” see if it can be done.
       You say, “You can’t crucify Him the second time.” 234 We’ll find out whether we can or not.

       into the Spirit of revelation. They don’t pray enough. They don’t call upon God enough. 266
       They just lightly take It, “Oh, well, I believe there’s a God. Sure!” The devil believes the same
       thing. The devil believes it more than some people claim to believe. The devil believes it and
       trembles. People just believe it and go on. But the devil trembles, knowing his Judgment is

       crucifying Him! Sure! I indict this generation, finding them guilty, by the same Word that
       found them guilty at the beginning. That’s right. Jesus said, “Who can condemn Me?” He

       99 Now, after He showed him all that mystery of them seven golden candlesticks (holding the
       seven stars, and a white wig on, and so forth, and feet like brass, and eyes like fire, the symbols),
       then he heard the same Voice (Watch.) speaking from Heaven. And he looked up and he saw an
       open Door. Oh! An open Door into Heaven! How do you get in? By Christ Jesus, that one Door,
       one Way, no other way. 100 “Any man that climbs up any other way, same is a thief and a
       robber.” And in the parable of the one who climbed up and was at the Wedding Supper
       without a garment on, was found guilty, and bound and cast out into outer darkness. Only one
       Way, coming to the Wedding Supper. I believe I preached on it here not long ago. Whenever the
       bridegroom…When a man got…gets married in the old country, he has to give the invitations
       himself, he has to furnish the robes himself. So when he met this man there, him sitting at the
       supper table…How many remembers the parable? Sure, you that read the Bible. And he found a
       man at the supper table without a wedding garment on. 101 What is it? The Bridegroom stands
       at the door and all comes up with an invitation. “No man can come to the Father except by
       Me. All the Father has given Me, or invited, will come to Me.” Here they come, give their
       invitation, the bridegroom, so that everybody will look alike. THAT’S ONE THING ABOUT
       GOOD, OLD-TIME, HOLY GHOST RELIGION, IT MAKES THEM ALL LOOK ALIKE.
       Whether they’re rich or poor, bond or free, black or white, male or female, they’re all one in
       Christ Jesus. And the bridegroom stood at the door and received the invitation, put the robe
       around this fellow, so the rich and poor all looked alike. That’s the way it is in the Kingdom of
       God, there’s no big guys and little guys; they’re all one guy, all one in Christ. 102 Now, what
       do you think when the Bridegroom come back and found a man sitting there without a
       Wedding Garment on? Said, “Friend, how’d you get in here?” And he stood speechless, it
       showed that he come some other way besides the Door. He come in a window, he come in a
       back door. And He called him a friend, showed he was a church member, “Friend, how did
       you get in here without a garment on?” Now, Jesus said this, Himself. And He called to the
       porter, He said, “Bind him, foot and hand.” And he was cast out into outer darkness where
       there’ll be weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. That’s Christ’s Own Words, (Right.) “He
       was cast out.” Because, it proved, without the Wedding Garment, he come some other way
       besides the Door. If he would have come by the Door, he would have received a Wedding
       Garment. 103 Oh, listen to this! Then if the Wedding Garment is the baptism of the Holy
       Spirit, how are we going to be represented any other way? If the first church age had to come
       by the Door, Christ Jesus, be baptized into the Name of Jesus Christ, receive the baptism of the
       Holy Ghost, to put on the Wedding Garment, how are we coming any other way? If you come
       by the Methodist, by the Baptist, or by the Pentecostals, or any other denomination, you will be
       bound and cast out into outer darkness. You’ve got to come by Christ Jesus, the Way, the Door,
       the Truth, the Life. Amen
        Let’s bow our heads. While our sister comes to the piano.
        We got a chance children. But all those that we’re bidden shall not taste of his supper! But

       William Marrion Branham
       172 Remember, Sodom burned. Is that right? Well, this world is to burn. Jesus said so. And it’ll
       be the time, that, like Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse said, “In the days it’d be like
       Sodom and Gomorrah, then the Son of man would be revealed.” And then what would happen?
       According to Malachi, He will burn the earth again, and the righteous (in the Millennium) will
       walk out upon the ashes of the wicked. Is that right? See? SO WE’RE RIGHT AT THE END
       TIME. WE’RE SETTING HERE AT THE DOOR NOW, WAITING FOR HIM TO COME.
       173 Notice, God promised in His Word that He would choose His Bride by His original way.
       He chose His. The Bridegroom! He foretold it by the prophets, and sent a prophet to identify it.
       The prophet said, standing on the banks of Jordan, “Behold!” They said, “You’re the Messiah,
       aren’t you?” He said, “No, I’m not the Messiah.” “You must be the Messiah.” 174 “But I’m not
       
       159
       Him. But He is standing among you. And His shoes, I’m not worthy to loosen. When He comes,
       makes Hisself known…” And today He is standing among us, in the Person of the Holy Ghost,
       manifesting Hisself more and more, coming into His Church, making Hisself known; because,
       Him, and the Bride and the Groom will be the same, making Hisself known. And one day
       you’ll see that the One that you feeled in your heart, and see His identification, will become
       personalized before you, then you and He are One. You’ve united by the Word. And the Word,
       was in the beginning, will go back to the beginning, which is God. “And that day you’ll know
       that I am in the Father, the Father in Me; I in you, and you in Me.” Hallelujah! We’re here.
       Hallelujah! I’m so glad to see Him personifying Himself right among us, and see what He
       promised for the Word; not what’s somebody’s emotion, singing, and jumping, and dancing. But
       by His Word, amen, He is making Himself known. 175 Look, when they brought, built the
       temple and brought the ark into it, God went in there with a Pillar of Fire. Amen. It was David
       jumping and screaming, it was all the singers and the priests carrying on, when they was out of
       the will of God. But when God identified the ark in His place and position, before they could get
       the ark in there, here come the Pillar of Fire leading the way; right down over the cherubims’
       wings, and right in behind the Holiest of holies, His resting place; the Pillar of Fire! And the
       glory of God was in there, till the pe-…they couldn’t even see how to minister. Amen. It’ll close
       the eyes of every theologian, WHEN HE COMES FOR HIS BRIDE. SHE’LL BE TAKEN UP
       IN THE—IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AS IT WAS, TO THEM. THEY WON’T
       EVEN SEE HER GO. Oh, praise be to God! 176 Notice, God promised that He would bring
       His Bride out, what He would do. There would be a Seed. There would be a Light in the
       evening time, how He would do all these things, just exactly, and by the way that He original
       planned it in the Old Testament and the New Testament. And it isn’t through denomination. It
       isn’t through our system we’re using today. We’re just causing death. Let people put their hands
       with It, and die from it. See? 177 THE WORD, THE EVENING MESSAGE, MUST CARRY
       EVENING RESULTS. THE EVENING MESSAGE MUST SOW EVENING SEED, NOT
       MORNING SEED. EVENING SEED! Is that right? The midday scene, its seeds back there,
       was denomination; it died, perished. But evening-time Message will show evening-time Light,
       will show evening-time results; the evening-time Message! Jesus’ time, midday message,
       showed midday results. The beginning message showed the beginning results, made creation.
       He made His Son in His Own image, in the midday. In the evening time He makes a Bride for
       It. See? What by? His Word. How did He form the earth? How did He speak it into existence?
       By His Word! Who was His Son? The Word! “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
       was with God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelled among.” How will He take His
       Bride? By the Word; not by a new cart, not by some theologian’s idea. But according to His
       Word He’ll identify Her. Don’t put one thing to It or take one thing from It now. Leave It the
       way It is. See? 178 The evening time, He promised He would reveal, though, open these Seven
       Seals and show what them churches had missed back there. Revelation 10, and Malachi 4,
       Luke 17:30, He said He would do it.
        It’s like all the prophesy, when Jesus hung at the cross, there all begin to take place one right
       after another.
        True, it’s true there’s one more shaking coming to the Gentile people. What a weeping and
       wailing of a gnashing of teeth it will be, to those that ate in his presence. See they don’t…they
       think… you can’t sit in the presence of God like people sat in the presence of God under that
       
       160
       man’s ministry and not be judged for it. You can’t hear and not be judged. Now judgement
       comin forth. Now they heard and they had a chance to do something with what they heard. Now
       the Lords gave a space of time to see what your gonna do. Now to those that just shirked it off
       and went on, they’re gonna come and repent, but it’s gonna be too late. What’s it gonna be
       brother Bob? Souls in prison can’t be saved impossible. What’s that power and that great
       ministry gonna do brother Bob? Haunt them, haunt them. Did you ever have a nightmare?
       They’re gonna be in a nightmare, they’re gonna know from the intelligence of their mind and
       their thinking that they have turned down the Messiah and they have rejected the Messiah. And
       know the wrath of God abides upon them and they’re gonna be haunted. Haunted because they
       done heard the Voice of the Bridegroom tell them they’re workers of iniquity and you can’t get
       the baptism, it’s to late. Your shut out, now we turn to the Jews. Oh yes!
        Brother and sister, we got time to receive it, now what are we gonna do with it here in
       Connecticut? Just sit here week after week or we gonna press into it, strive and struggle to enter
       into it. God help us to do it.

        sermon: `Opening prayer by Brother Robert Lambert:
        Precious heavenly father, we come to you this morning through the shed blood of the Lord
       Jesus and to thank you, and praise you for the empty tomb this morning, Lord. We are so
       thankful that you chose to lay down thy your life. No man was great enough to take it from you
       Lord, but you laid it down for our sakes. You took all of our sins and all of our transgressions, all
       of our iniquities upon thy self. And Lord, we are so thankful you did this for us Lord.
       John 10:17-18-Reference quote:
       17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
       18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have
       power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
       For we had no holiness and no righteousness Lord, and what goodness we have its all-filthy rags
       in thy sight. But Lord you suffered and died and bleed that we might become the righteousness
       of Jesus Christ. Lord, we are so thankful for the Lord Jesus this morning and we love Him with
       all of our hearts.
       Isaiah 64:6-Reference quote:
       6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all
       do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
       Romans 3:10-Reference quote:
       10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
       And we know Lord that there’s not many days left upon this earth. And we know standing here
       this morning, is souls of men and women, nice good people Lord, that Lord Jesus are in the
       valley of decision some of them Lord. And we realize Lord Jesus that the great resurrection time
       is at hand and everything from the beginning of the foundation of the world is centered upon the
       hour that we’re living in. And thou art moving all the props and all the actors into the last finale
       Lord, the grand finale the curtain is being pulled back. And Lord we’re playing one part or the
       other. We just pray that you’ll help us and give us of thy grace this morning. And Father we pray
       that you’d bless your children all over the world today.
       Bless your church and bless your Bride. And we just pray Lord, the hour will soon arrive when
       you’ll deliver your people and set them free. Remember your precious children down at the
       tabernacle in Jeffersonville this morning Lord listening to the tapes and we just pray that you’ll

       bless them each one. And Lord how we pray that you’ll remember us here this morning father as
       we stand our post of duty. And bless each and every one that here in the name of the Lord Jesus
       we pray. Amen.
        You may be seated. We’re happy to be with you this morning. I believe the presence of the
       Lord is here and that means everything when the presence of the Lord is here. Take no salt for
       the soup, and it’s no good just pour it out. But we love to lift up the Lord Jesus. We believe
       we’re living in a hour when the Lord Jesus is gonna glorify His name and glorify Himself. We
       believe that Christianity is the only true religion in the world because it has an empty tomb this
       morning. And we’re so thankful that we’re not gathered here this morning around some creed or
       some ism but we’re gathered here to worship the Lord Jesus. He’s our all in all, our central
       theme of our thinking in our life, to be centered around the lovely Lord Jesus. We’re living in an
       hour when everyone ought to be madly in love, so to speak, with the Lord Jesus. And after all, if
       you take the Lord Jesus out of it, it’s not worth getting up or getting dressed for in the morning.
       There’s nothing in this world… and I’m persuaded that anything in this world that could try to
       satisfy you, when you meet Jesus Christ, it’s just a vexation to your spirit. There’s nothing for us
       to look forward to but the Lord Jesus gathering His Bride together and preparing them for the
       rapture. That’s why we’re here this morning. We just pray that God would bless you.
        I’m glad to see brother Frank, (Pace from Beverly, Massachusetts) we haven’t seen him in a
       long time. And the other brother we haven’t seen before. We’re very happy to have each and
       every one of you with us.
        And, I got a message from the Lord! I don’t say that presumably but I know he witnessed it.
       I’ve been laying off to preach this for some time. And I know some may not understand it, but
       you just pray about it, you know and the Lord will reveal it to you. And all those that’s been here
       for the last month you know, what’s been happening here supernaturally. And we’re very
       thankful for these things that the Lord’s doin'. And tryin' to humble ourselves and purge our
       souls with prayers, fasting’s and crying to God that we might be ready for the great thing He’s
       getting ready to do.
        And remember, it’s like a brother said the other night, if the devil could get this Revelation…
       If the natural mind…If the natural mind can get this revelation, then the devil’s got it. So, it’s
       gonna to be a Revelation to the elected Bride, and it’s not him that runneth, or him that willeth,
       but it’s God that showeth mercy. It’s God that showeth mercy.
       Romans 9:15-16-Reference quote:
       5 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have
       compassion on whom I will have compassion.
       16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
       God gives Revelation by sovereign grace. You could fast and pray till your skin and bones, you
       can give up in any manner of thing and that wouldn’t do it, it comes by sovereign grace, you see.
       And so that’s what we need is Revelation, more than anything else in this world.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 1 - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       We talk about a God that does not change. The Jews believe that too. But the church changed its
       unchanging God from ONE to THREE. But the light is returning at eventide. How striking it is
       that this truth has come at the time when the Jews are returning to Palestine. God and Christ are
       ONE. This Jesus is BOTH LORD AND CHRIST. JOHN HAD THE REVELATION, AND
       JESUS WAS THE REVELATION, AND HE PRODUCED HIMSELF RIGHT HERE IN
       THE SCRIPTURE — “I AM HE THAT WAS, WHICH IS, AND SHALL COME, THE
       ALMIGHTY. Amen.” If revelation is beyond you, look up and seek God for it. That is the only
       way you are ever going to get it. A revelation has to come from God. It never comes by human,
       natural endowments, but by Spiritual enduement. You can even memorize the Scripture, and
       though that is wonderful, that won’t do it. It has to be a revelation from God. It says in the
       Word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost. You have to
       receive the Holy Ghost and then, and only then, can the Spirit give you the revelation that
       Jesus is the Christ: God, the Anointed One. No man knows the things of God save the Spirit of
       God and he to whom the Spirit of God reveals them. WE NEED TO CALL ON GOD FOR
       REVELATION MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD. We have accepted the
       Bible, we have accepted the great truths of it, but it still is not real to most people because the
       revelation by the Spirit is not there. The Word has not been quickened. The Bible says in II
       Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our union with Jesus Christ.
       Did you get it? It says that WE ARE THE VERY RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD HIMSELF by
       being IN CHRIST. It says that He (Jesus) became SIN for us. It does not say He became
       sinful, but became SIN for us that by our union with Him we might become the
       RIGHTEOUSNESS of God. If we accept the fact (and we must) that He literally became SIN
       for us by His substitution for us, then we must also accept the fact that we by our union with
       Him have become the VERY RIGHTEOUSNESS of God. To reject one is to reject the other.
       To accept the one is to accept the other. Now we know the Bible says that. It can’t be denied. But
       the revelation of it is missing. It is not real to the majority of God’s children. It is just a good
       verse in the Bible. But we need to have it made ALIVE to us. That will take revelation.
       
       4
        Now usually we preach a message on Easter the resurrection. I’ve always done that, but I just
       didn’t feel to do it. And this message really pressed me and I’ve been awful nervous the last few
       days and I’m not really physically in good shape too. I’m going to try to minister this morning
       and I’m going to trust the Lord and I believe He wants us to know it, and it’s on the angels. And
       I tried to bring it down where it wouldn’t be so long for you. Maybe I’ll hook up some things
       tonight, but it’s real hard on your mind, it’s real taxing. Course you know when you move up
       into the realm of Revelation, well there’s where the demon power is laying.
        And I’m certainly thankful for the… How many… I wasn’t here, I was next-door. How many
       felt the presence of God here this morning? Let’s see your hands. Now something has been
       happening for some time… and I know some of you posted spiritually, if your spiritual, you
       know. I believe with all my heart, that something has been happening for some time, and it just
       hasn’t been known. But it could be just anytime now there’s going to be a great something that
       will strike the earth. It certainly puts me on such an expectation and just such pressure, it’s hard
       to explain it. But I know it’s the truth.
        Now, let’s open our Bibles and you pray for me. How many of you want to hear from the
       Lord? (Amen) See, if we come and we just have the right attitude and the right spirit… after all
       we may not all understand but, I believe if you have the right spirit and the right heart and you
       love the Lord Jesus, then He’s gonna reveal it because the Bride has got to become one, see.
       We’ll never do the job that God’s called us for, one pulling this way and one pulling that way.
       But he’s gonna do something for His people.

       Bride.” And the bride is no longer, and the bridegroom is no longer, two people; they are one.
       “She is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone.” AND THEN WHEN A MAN OR WOMAN IS

       BECOME A FULL MEMBER OF THIS BODY WHEN THEY’RE FILLED WITH THE
       HOLY GHOST. Cause, God took the Spirit out of Christ, raised up His body and placed it on
       His Throne, and sent back the Holy Spirit to make up the mystical Body of Christ, which will
       be united at the Marriage Supper at the Coming of the Lord. You cannot organize It. It is a

       Pergamean Church Age- An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The
       William Marrion Branham
       Now then, this Word He has left behind on the printed page is a part of Him when you accept it
       by faith into a Spirit-filled life. He said that His Word was life. John 6:63b. But that is exactly
       what He is: John 14:6, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.” Romans 8:9b, “If any man
       have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” There it is, He is Spirit and He is Life. That is
       exactly what the Word is; that is exactly what Jesus is. He is the Word. So when a Spirit-born,
       
       5
       Spirit-filled man in faith takes that Word into his heart and places it upon his lips, why that is
       the same as Deity speaking. Every mountain has to go. Satan cannot stand before that man. If
       the church, way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the living Word
       in their midst, the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages. And right
       today, when the church returns to the Word in faith, we can say without doubt that the glory of
       God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again. One night as I was seeking the
       Lord, the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write. As I grasped the pen to write, His
       Spirit gave me a message for the church. I want to bring it to you. It has to do with the Word and
       the bride. Here is what I am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each specie
       brings forth after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let the earth
       bring forth grass, and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind,
       whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came forth
       into a plant and thence into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed
       started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. In
       these last days the true Bride Church (Christ’s seed) will come to the Headstone, and she will
       be the super church, a super race, as she nears Him. They in the bride will be so much like
       Him that they will even be in His very image. This is in order to be united with Him. They will
       be one. They will be the very manifestation of the Word of the living God. Denominations
       cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their dogmas, mixed with
       the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son (Adam) was the spoken
       seed-Word of God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. That is why the bride was given
       to him, to reproduce himself; to produce another son of God. But she fell. She fell by
       hybridization. She caused him to die. The second Son (Jesus), also a spoken Seed-Word of God
       was given a bride like as was Adam. But before He could marry her, she also had fallen. She,
       like Adam’s wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God and live, or
       doubt the Word and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little group of the
       true seed of the Word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a virgin of His
       Word. She is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas. By and through the
       members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the
       virgin. The word of promise came to the virgin Mary. But that Word of promise was He,
       Himself, to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He, Himself, acted at that time and
       fulfilled His own Word of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had brought her the
       message. But the angel’s message was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He fulfilled at that time all
       that was written of Him because she accepted His Word to her. The members of the virgin
       bride will love Him, and they will have His potentials, for He is their head, and all power
       belongs to Him. They are subject to Him as the members of our bodies are subject to our
       heads. Notice the harmony of the Father and the Son. Jesus never did anything until it was
       first showed Him by the Father. John 5:19. This harmony is now to exist between the Groom
       and His bride. He shows her His Word of life. She receives it. She never doubts it. Therefore,
       nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up
       again. Here is the secret of this. The Word is in the bride (as it was in Mary). The bride has the
       mind of Christ for she knows what He wants done with the Word. She performs the command
       of the Word in His name for she has “thus saith the Lord.” Then the Word is quickened by the
       
       6
       Spirit and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted and watered, it comes to full harvest,
       serving its purpose. Those in the bride do only His will. No one can make them do otherwise.
       They have “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing
       the works, fulfilling His own Word. He did not complete all His work while in His earthly
       ministry so now He works in and through the bride. She knows that, for it was not yet time for
       Him to do certain things that He must now do. But He will now fulfill through the bride that
       work which He left for this specific time.
        So now you…I believe it is the will of the Lord. I certainly believe it is the will of God for me
       to minister on this subject, on the ministering of angels.
        But we appreciate the Easter this morning, we appreciate God’s Easter, His resurrection. And
       we’re just so thankful that we’re not a Mohamad or a Jane or a Hindu, or whatever it is. We’re so
       thankful that we have a hope of being a Christian. Of course, I always say the word Christian is a
       mighty big word. Christian, that means being just like the Lord Jesus and doing the same things
       that He did. And I believe if we are honest hearted in this hour, if we’re honest hearted and
       sincere and humble as a little baby, I really believe the world…the world is getting ready to see a
       Christian. I really do!
        Now let’s open our Bibles, to Hebrews the first chapter. Now I ain’t gonna preach I’m just
       gonna try to take my time and bring this out. But now, what you do you’ll have to go home and
       meditate and pray, and then if you receive Revelation it will blossom out and start running
       everywhere, you’ll see the Bible and receive benefits from it for a long time after that you hear
       this. But now what you have to do is go back and listen what I told you before and fit it together.
       See, I couldn’t possibly preach the whole Revelation this morning. I’ve been doin' it for four
       years fittin' it together. And I take any man to charge if they can find one thing that I ever said
       that contradicted anything that I said four years ago, I’ll repent and never preach the gospel
       again. How many give a hearty amen to that! (AMEN!) Why? It’s the infallible God revealing
       His Word. Man is clear out of the picture; get your eyes on man you’ll fall. Get your eyes on the
       Lord Jesus you’ll never fail. I’m convinced of this, that man is a total failure to begin with. But
       you see it’s the gift of God, it’s the Holy Spirit.
        Now, Hebrews 1 and 14. Now, this is going to fit right in with the Revelation. Hebrews 1 and
       13 we will start reading.
       Hebrews 1:13-14-Scripture Reading;
       13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine
       enemies thy footstool?
       14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of
       salvation?
        Now, let’s bow our heads just a minute.
        Now father, I believe that this is a great thing that thou hast revealed to me. And Lord God, I
       feel God thou knowest I feel so unworthy to handle the Revelation of God for this hour, that’s
       come by thy great prophet, Elijah. And I just pray that you’d forgive me of all my sins and all of
       my shortcomings. You would bless this message father and help the little children’s hearts to be
       
       7
       encouraged for the great thing that you’re ready to do for them. We pray and ask this, in Jesus’
       name. Amen.
        Now, the subject that I’d like to teach to you this morning a little bit by the help of the Lord
       Jesus, is ministering spirits, which are angels, Angels. Just what part do these ministring spirits
       and angels play in this end time as far as the bride of Christ is concerned?
        Now notice here, that Paul is speaking here, which we believe to be the writer of Hebrews,
       said, that there are spirits, angels, and they are to minister to those who are heirs, joint heirs of
       Christ.
        Now I know that the things that I say are controversial, but I can’t help that, you see. If God
       doesn’t come and vindicate it right shortly with the things that I’ve told you then I’ll be found a
       liar. But I’m sure that He will. Because He told me that He would. And so, I stand and preach
       these things by faith.
        Now notice that I have said, “That I did not believe the Bride of Jesus Christ has come into
       her heir-ship yet.” If it did, the world would be shaken with the power of God in the Bride. Now
       you have to be honest hearted to receive Revelation. Of course, you can be stubborn and buttbutt-butt right up against it, but then you just lose your soul in the end, you see. But the facts
       speak for themselves.
        Now notice here, that the ministering angels are only to minister to heirs, the heirs. And you
       know what an heir is. You can’t be an heir until first something dies. And we know that the Lord
       Jesus Christ died to give us everything that He was. All that God was, He gave it to Christ. And
       all that Christ is, He’s going to give it to His heirs, which is… not the church now, but the heirs
       are the believers, believers of a certain promise. See, in order to be a believer, first you have to
       be tested on a promise. And of course, we know the promise today is none other than the Seal of
       God the capstone, the true capstone Baptism of the Holy Spirit, the Seal of God.

       160 God, expressed in Jesus Christ, Who was both Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, “the fullness of
       the Godhead bodily.” 161 Now “the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily” dwells in His
       Church, the preeminences. ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE POURED INTO CHRIST; AND ALL
       CHRIST WAS, WAS POURED INTO THE CHURCH, THE BELIEVERS. 162 Not
       denomination! We’ll get to that in a few minutes, and it’ll take it out of your mind forever, see;
       show you what causes that, by the help of God, if He’ll just permit it to us. 163 What’s His
       purpose now? Express Himself as a Son, see, and, now, that in Him might dwell “the fullness
       of the Godhead bodily.” I’m, I’ve got Colossians laying here, right before me. See? That, all
       through the Scripture, that’s what God purpose was. THEN, THROUGH THIS LIFE OF
       THIS SON, HIS CROSS, “THE BLOOD,” IT SAYS HERE, “OF HIS CROSS,” THAT HE
       MIGHT RECONCILE TO HIMSELF A BODY, A BRIDE; WHICH IS EVE, SECOND EVE.
       And God give it in a type, like He did Moses and all of them. The same thing He did in Adam and
       Eve, giving a type, that they were Christ and the Bride. He is the second Adam; the Church is
       the second Eve.

       66 All the Word of God was time-tested. And He is the great Captain that’s going before us,
       with His Own bloody coat waving, that, through the redeeming love of the Blood of Jesus
       Christ has bought a Church, by the Holy Spirit THAT TESTED EVERY BOLT AND EVERY
       PERSON THAT’S EVER ANCHORED IN THIS GREAT CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
       IT’S A TIME-TESTED MATERIAL THAT DOES IT. 67 And as He marches on, the great
       regime coming behind Him, as a born-again Church of the living God, She don’t move,
       because we have received a Kingdom that cannot be moved. IT’S DUG PLUMB TO THE
       SOLID ROCK, OF CHRIST JESUS, BEING THE CHIEF CORNERSTONE. AND AS HE
       GOES BEFORE US, WITH HIS OWN BLOODY COAT, MAKING THE WAY, IT’S THE
       SIGN OF REDEMPTION.
        Now I notice here, that these ministers are ministering spirits sent forth from God to minister
       to the heirs of the Lord Jesus Christ salvation.
        Now, another scripture. Well, let’s wait just a minute now. Let me drive that down with a
       Brother Branham. Now you used to you had to know a little of the Bible, now you have to know
       all the Bible and everything Brother Branham said, so it takes a little time you know.
        Let’s read Page five and six of, “The Seed Is Not Heir with the Shuck.” To kinda drive this
       down in your mind before we go on… if I can get your mind to relax here, it’ll be easier on the
       way.
        Now notice here reading from Page 5, now listen here. Now I’ll skip down here real quickly. I
       quote Brother Branham now, page 5 “The Seed Is Not Heir With The Shuck”
       “If there be some present here, or listening in out across the nation that are not ready or prepared
       to meet the challenge of this hour and the message from God, calling us to repent and to be ready
       for the Kingdom of God is nearing. Nearing! We pray that they will become ready tonight.”

       “And if there be some here, or listening in, out across the nation, if they are not ready and
       prepared at this hour to meet the challenge of the hour, the Message from God, to repent and
       to be ready, for the Kingdom of God is nearing. We pray that it’ll be so, tonight,” with them,
       that they will meet this hour’s challenge.”
        Now I’d like to quote from page 6 his text taken on this subject, “The Seed Not Heir With
       The Shuck” Quoting from Galatians 4:27.
       
       9
       Galatians 4:27-31-Scripture Reading:
       27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that
       travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.
        Now we know that’s the Bride. The Bride has not travailed and brought forth Jesus Christ
       yet.
       Galatians 4:27:28-Scripture Reading;
       28 “Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. Watch that now!
       29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit,
       even so it is now.
       30 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of
       the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
       31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.”
        Now, that was 1965, and the prophet of God said, that the Bride of Christ had not come into
       Her inheritance yet. Now we know as the Scriptures said that these ministering angels are only
       going to minister to the heirs of salvation. Now that means that you are ready to be an heir. That
       means you must be elected to be an heir. And there are two covenants, the true Bride of Christ or
       the true church, and then there is the church natural and the church spiritual. Now, I said I
       believe the greatest deception of the enemy in this hour, is trying to get the people to take a
       natural birth instead of a supernatural birth. As long as you have a natural birth that’s why you
       don’t have the power and the authority that the early church had. But now notice here… Now I
       don’t have time to get into this because it’s a big subject in its self, but you know my teaching on
       the born-again experience: the new birth.

       264 So you see what it was, the cankerworm got to eating. It eat away the baptism of water in the
       Name of Jesus Christ. 265 The next thing that the cankerworm did, it taken away the baptism
       of the Holy Ghost. Cause, as long as you’re going to have that Holy Ghost, It’s going to shed
       light on that Word, as long as you’ll do that. So they had to—to do it different. 266 Now, just
       think of how many Lutherans, Protestants, how many Catholics, this morning, was confirmed,
       what they call it, taking first communion. And they call that “Holy Eucharist,” which means, a
       Latin word, “Holy Ghost.” Did you ever see a Catholic pass by the church and go over hisself
       like that? [Brother Branham illustrates—Ed.] Why? “It’s god in that church.” What is god?
       “That little piece of bread.” That little piece of bread, round, made like the sun-god that they
       worship, laying on the altar where the mice and roaches pack around, overnight. That’s not my
       God. I’ll tell you that now. “First communion, confirmed to the church.” Nonsense. 267 But
       that’s what they did. That’s what the cankerworm did. It took away the Spirit and give them a
       piece of bread, some bread that some priest made, or some nun, or something. That’s what they
       did. That’s exactly right. Go, ask now. Go, looking back in history, and see if it isn’t right. And
       
       10
       you let that thing be shoved down your throat? Not only them Catholics, but you Protestants, a
       many of you, same thing. All right. There’s what they did. All right. 268 And then the Protestant,
       instead of having the Holy Ghost, you know what they do? They come and join, shake a hand.
       There wasn’t that somebody come up the road and shook a hand, WHEN THE DAY OF
       PENTECOST COME. “BUT THERE CAME FROM HEAVEN THE SOUND OF A
       RUSHING MIGHTY WIND, THAT FILLED ALL THE HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE
       SETTING,” that’s right, come down through them leaves on trees, poured over the bark.
       That’s right. 269 NOW, NOW, INSTEAD OF THE NEW BIRTH that Jesus said, a man must
       be borned again, they adopted joining their church, “Come and join.” INSTEAD OF THE
       WORD, THE CANKERWORM GIVE THEM A CREED. Don’t you see? Look here what he’s
       doing. He’s giving a natural for a spiritual. Can you see it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—
       Ed.] 270 Now look. Now, we, we’re—we’re on the Catholic line here, but did you know that
       come right down through the Protestants too? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Where do we
       have the Holy Ghost demonstrations in Protestant churches today? Where do we have a
       Pentecostal reaction in amongst Protestants? WE DON’T HAVE. You have it in Lutheran?
       [“No.”] IF YOU DO, I WANT TO GO TO IT. I want to go over there and just eat and have a
       wonderful time. Presbyterian? Where—where is—where is it at? See? You’ve adopted
       something natural. 271 I’m fixing to leave, and you know that. See? Don’t you never let This
       get out of your heart. 272 DON’T TAKE THE NATURAL. THAT’S DEATH. THIS
       NATURAL MAN IS DEATH. ANYTHING IT DOES, IS DEATH. IT’S SUBJECT AND
       HERE FOR DEATH. “IT’S THE SPIRIT THAT MAKETH ALIVE,” SEE, THE SPIRIT
       THAT GIVES LIFE, QUICKENS IT. IT’S A SPIRIT. 273 So, you see, they took…Watch what
       they done. Took the water baptism, from “Jesus Christ,” to “Father, Son, Holy Ghost,” a title,
       which is no Name at all. 274 Now, you say, “What difference does it make?” All right. Now, if
       you’re going to give… 275 Somebody is going to give you your pay check, Saturday, the—the—
       the man that pays you. Instead of putting his name on there, just say, “From—from ‘The boss.’”
       That’s what it…Your pay check, just, “Pay to the order of John Doe, a hundred and fifty dollars,
       for this week’s work. From, ‘The boss.’” Put it down, the bank, and see how it bounces back.
       Yeah. Yeah. Yes, sir. It sure will. Surely. 276 If it don’t make a difference, why did Paul
       command them Christians, praising God and having a lot of joy, and having the great things
       going on up there, why did he tell them, “You got to come back and be baptized, over again, in
       the Name of Jesus Christ”? See? Take the Word, say, just stay with It. Don’t say nothing
       different. Just say what It says. See? That’s what we’re going to be judged by. 277 Now look.
       THAT’S WHAT THEY DID. INSTEAD OF THE NEW BIRTH, THEY HAVE A JOINING.
       INSTEAD OF TALKING THE WORD, THEY HAVE A CREED. Show me in the Bible where
       they ever said a “Hail Mary.” Show me in the Bible where you Protestants ever quoted Apostles’
       Creed. Tell me what the Apostles’ Creed is, in the Bible, “Communion of saints.” They was
       against it. Tell me in the Bible where they ever had “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost” baptism. It’s
       not there. And yet you go for it. Huh?
        Paul said here that the children that was born of the flesh, persecuted those children that were
       born after the spirit.
       
       11
       Galatians 4:29-Reference quote:
       29 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit,
       even so it is now.
        So, there’s your war right there. And Brother Branham said that every revival produced twins.
       And there are twins following this message today. There is going to be one group that is born of
       the unadulterated revealed Word of God and they’re going to be after their promise and after
       their inheritance. Then there’s going to be another group following that say they already got it,
       and they’ll turn and fight those. I’m not responsible for the scriptures. Let everything fall where
       it will, see. That’s the truth and God Almighty knows it’s so.

       freewoman, which is the Bride of Christ.

       forth Christ yet, but she was going to be pregnant by the unadulterated Word of truth, and at the

       good fellow, clean, moral, as far as I know of, but he don’t know nothing about that Birthright.
       He’s born that way. He’s shaped that way. 176 And Jacob, I don’t care what he is, he wants
       that Birthright. He’s the spiritual one. 177 And them two, today, is in the womb of the church.
       There’s a great big system trying to be formed, called the World Council of Churches. And from
       the womb of the church is coming forth two children. You just mark my word. The world’s… 178
       THE WORD MUST DELIVER THE WORD BRIDE CHURCH. THE CHURCH HAS GOT

       feet coming to your head. She gets—gets greater, and more you have to have, and so forth. As
       
       12
       the body grows up, so does the Body of Christ grow up. And then finally the Head will come to It,
       the Head of It will, now, if we notice, ’cause It’s—It’s all linked to the Head. The Head does the

       41 When Jannes and Jambres could stand and throw their sticks down and turn into a serpent,
       and could do all the same things… Just like a spiritualist can almost do today, “deceive the very
       elected if possible,” call out great crowds, and have great so-and-so, and everything. That don’t
       stop it a bit. If you’ve ever been in the Presence of God, you know where you’re standing. You
       know Who your Father is; you know where you was born from. If a man has no more than a
       handshake, and a name on a book, and a letter in some church, he don’t know who his papa was.
       That’s right. If there’s anything I feel sorry for, is the mule. Don’t you… Now, God created all
       things, but He didn’t create a mule. No, sir. As Booth-Clibborn’s used to say, He didn’t create
       him. No. You know, that was what man done. He—he—he crossed from the horse to the jenny;
       
       13
       that’s what caused the mule. He cannot cross hisself back; he cannot produce hisself no more.
       That’s right. He has to stay right where he’s at. And if there ever was a ignoramus, it’s a mule.
       That’s right. Why, you can set and just holler at him, and scream at him as much as you want
       to, he will stick them big ears out and just look at you. That’s… 42 I seen so many of them at
       meetings. You’re talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost; they get up and go home like a
       mule. That’s exactly right. They don’t know who their father was; just stand there and look,

       no such a thing as that. Haw, haw.” Now, a horse ain’t like that. He’s gentle and sweet, come
       up, put his neck over your shoulder and nicker; he’s gentle. But not a ignorant old mule. Now,
       he don’t know who is papa was, who his mommy was. He can’t cross himself back; he can’t
       reproduce himself. He’s just a… He’s a crossbreed. And that’s a—what’s the matter with a lot
       of so-called Christians today: cross breeds with the world. No wonder you can’t never be
       settled: double minded, never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Man’s got to know
       God by the new birth, and be borned and filled with the Holy Ghost; stand in those sea—those
       tracks there, where Moses stood; stand in the Presence of God and hold a conference. That’s
       when God called man. Certainly. 43 Moses goes right down into Egypt, and no matter what
       hard thing come along. All of the Egyptians and everything else could perform, and do, and
       impersonate; that didn’t stop Moses. He kept going on, because he had had a conference with
       God. There might be snake handlers, and oh, I don’t… firewalkers, and everything else come up
       in the world, but a man that’s ever received the Holy Ghost knows exactly where he’s standing, if
       he’s ever had a conference and talk with God, been borned… Those things don’t shake him;
       certainly not. He knows Who he believes; he know Who his papa is. Isn’t it mighty fine to look
       at a thoroughbred horse? You go back to his pedigree, you know who his father was, who his
       grandfather was, who his great-grandfather was; just go on back. He’s got a pedigree. I tell
       you, we got too many straggling Christians without pedigrees. Say, “I was a Methodist last
       week, a Baptist the week before last, and Presbyterian before that, and a Pentecostal before that,
       and…” Oh, my, they got no pedigree at all. 44 But a man that’s come to God, and stood in the
       Presence of God, and accept God’s grace and His salvation, been borned again, and filled with
       the Holy Ghost, he is a son of God. Hallelujah! All the devils in hell can’t shake him away
       from it; he knows where he’s at. He knows Who his daddy is. He knows where his strength
       comes from; he knows Who he’s believed, he knows His God! Certainly. He knows His Word;
       he stays with it. He believes God. He eats… He eats children’s food; he eats sheep food. Too
       many feeding weeds today instead of sheep food—starving them to death. What we need today is
       the Holy Spirit back to feed the children, down by the shady green pastures and the still waters.
       Certainly. God’s peace, like a river flowing through our soul, knowing that we’ve passed from
       death unto life, that we are new creatures in Christ Jesus.
        Now notice, the elected royal seed of faith…Now notice we become this seed of Abraham by
       faith. And Abraham had a faith and a promise. And our promise today is not sanctification or
       justification, but our promise today is the Capstone Seal of God. And the pyramid was never a
       capped, the Seal of God has never come to the Bride yet. God don’t seal a mess.

       62-0407 - The Signs Of His Coming
       William Marrion Branham
       What was it? It was—it was a body, growing from the feet, coming up, comes up more important
       parts of the body from the feet, on into the lungs, and the heart, on into the Head. Who is the
       Head? Who is the Head? Christ. That’s the intelligence. How’s the body move? By the head.
       Amen. And the government shall be upon what? His… [Audience replies, “Shoulders.”—Ed.]
       What is His shoulders? His body. Amen. There’s where the real true church speaks in His
       power. There’s where the apostolic power returns to the church, when the government shall be
       upon His shoulders; judgment. THERE’S COMING A REAL CHURCH, I BELIEVE,
       TRYING TO DO MY PART TO PRESENT IT, HAVE IT READY THE BEST I KNOW
       HOW, TO PRESENT MY PART IN MY AGE TO CHRIST WHEN HE COMES. 119 Look
       and what… do… If you got a dollar bill in your pocket, take it out. On one side, the right side,
       it’s got the American seal, a eagle with the arrows in his paw. That’s the seal of the United
       States. Then on the other side it’s got the pyramid. And the cap never was put on the pyramid.
       It’s got like a big eye shining there for the cap, and it said “The Great Seal.” Why would that be
       the Great Seal in the United States instead of our own seal? Did you ever think of it? Look on it,
       see if it don’t say “The Great Seal.” Why wasn’t the pyramid ever had a cap on it? Same thing
       is in the temple of Solomon: the headstone was rejected. Certainly. But it’s coming down. And
       I’ve been to the pyramids in Egypt. And them stones are laid in there so perfect you can’t take
       a razor blade, hardly, and go between them. Now, they fit perfectly. How they built it, they
       don’t know, and the sphinx and so forth. They can’t tell. But look; right where that headstone’s
       supposed to fit, it’s honed. If they ever could find the headstone, it would fit just so perfectly
       snug it would bind the whole thing together. That’s the Bride of Jesus Christ. WHEN THE
       HEADSTONE COMES, THERE WILL BE A CHURCH HERE ON EARTH TO RECEIVE
       IT. IT’LL HAVE A MINISTRY JUST EXACTLY LIKE HIS. It’ll just go right in there,
       bringing up the feet, Luther, and all the rest of them for the resurrection. 120 Some fell asleep in
       one watch, some in the next watch, and some on down to the seventh watch. That’s the seven
       church ages. But WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM COME THEY WOKE (AMEN), COME OUT
       FROM—FROM AMONG THE DEAD, and rose in the resurrection. We’re living in the last
       days. You say, “What did you say? Luther, Wesley: justification, sanctification, baptism of the
       Holy Ghost?” Yes. And then the headstone. Is that right? The headstone was in the pyramid.
       Let’s take the ark. Let’s take… Here’s one. Let’s get away from that part, come back here. Let’s
       take the ark: one floor, two floors, three floors. Is that right? Where did the light come from?
       Where was the window? Upstairs on the third floor. That’s where the power of God will come
       to a church. A sun (s-u-n) shined through there, but the S-o-n will come in this way to the
       church that God’s honing out and getting ready, bringing in a ministry to the church just
       exactly like what the palmerworm, and—and the locust, and the caterpillar eat up back there.
       121 This stump’s growed from Wesley through—from Luther, to Wesley, to Pentecost; and now
       is honing out those Pentecostals, and those that’s got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And shall
       come, someday, the Headstone, Christ Jesus, in these last days. And we’ll have to have a
       ministry just exactly like His—His whole Spirit as it gets closer, closer, closer, closer. The
       negative becomes so positive that after while the negative and positive blends together, Church
       
       15
       and Christ to make one: for we’re flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone. Amen. You believe
       it? “It shall be Light in the evening time.” Amen. We’re here today. You believe it? Sorry to
       keep you this long. Let us pray.
        It’d be like Brother Ruddell said down in Georgia, “If Jesus Christ come after this that’s
       called bride now, He’d better put a sack over her head in slip her out at night.” But I’m
       persuaded He’s coming after A BEAUTIFUL BRIDE - A GLORIOUS BRIDE, A POWERFUL
       BRIDE. That’s bone of His bone, flesh of his flesh spirit of His spirit, and Power of His power,
       doing the same works that Jesus Christ did.
       Ephesians 5:30-Reference quote:
       30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

       11 Now, if the Church of the living God, which is the pillar of the truth… GOD INTENDED
       THIS CHURCH TO BE A POWERFUL CHURCH, A GLORIOUS CHURCH, A CHURCH

       accepted and espoused, and to live in such a—an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way
       that the… God would be proud of this Church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord.
       It should live in that—in that characteristic in the Church, and it should be living that way. But
       we find out that many times that with good intentions that people are trying to make themselves

       wouldn’t be changed. The only thing to do is save yourself from this generation by looking to
       Jesus Christ, accepting Him, and be borned into to God’s provided way, the baptism of the Holy
       Spirit. Amen. Listen. He died on the cross. And there He bled. He was a—took upon Himself
       the form of sinful flesh. He died in my stead. He was just as… God took out of the side of
       Adam a rib and made a bride to him. GOD OPENED UP THE SIDE OF CHRIST AND
       TAKEN OUT WATER, BLOOD, AND SPIRIT FOR A BRIDE, FOR THE—HISSELF, FOR
       CHRIST. HOW BEAUTIFUL. “And by one Spirit (not by one church membership)—By one
       Spirit are we all baptized (Amen)—are we all baptized into one Body and become members of
       that Body.” And just as sure as God raised that Body in the literal (out from the grave) the
       spiritual Body will go in the rapture. Truly.

       62-0318 - The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed
       William Marrion Branham
       18 The Word of promise in Himself, like It was in Mary, God Himself made manifest. He will
       act Himself, by His Own Word of promise, so to fulfill all that has been written of Him, as He
       did when He came from the virgin womb. Type of the Spirit womb now, so will the Virgin now,
       accepting His Word, “Be it unto me as Thou has said.” Though it was said by an Angel, while
       it yet was the written Word, Isaiah 9:6. 419 They will love Him, love His, and will have His
       potentials, for He is their Head. And they are His subjects, subject to His Head. Headship of
       Christ was His. 420 Notice what harmony! Jesus never did anything until seen of the Father, or,
       the Father showed Him first. Harmony between God and Christ, see, John 5:19. SO WILL
       THE BRIDE, AND HE SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE. HE SHOWS HER, AND SHE
       RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT. NOTHING CAN HARM HER, NOT EVEN
       DEATH. For if the Seed be planted, the water will raise It up again. (Amen. Then I got a great
       big “Hallelujah!”) Here is the secret. The Word is in the Bride, and the mind of Christ, to
       know what He wants done with the Word. And She does it in His Name. She has THUS
       SAITH THE LORD. Then It is germitized, so the Holy Spirit waters It until It is grown and
       serves Its purpose. 421 They do only His will. (Amen. I’ll believe that.) No one can persuade
       them different. They have THUS SAITH THE LORD or they keep still. THEN THEY WILL
       DO THE WORKS OF GOD, FOR IT IS HIMSELF IN THEM CONTINUING HIS WORD
       TO FULFILL, AS HE DID COMPLETE IN HIS DAYS. ALL THINGS, WHEN HE WAS
       HERE, HE DID NOT COMPLETE ALL WHEN HE WAS HERE, FOR IT WAS NOT TIME
       YET. 422 Now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb. (Now watch close. This is going to have a
       spiritual background.) Now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb, as we see the promised Land
       coming in sight. It’s nearing the time to be given. Joshua, in Hebrew, means Saviour, and
       represents the promised end-time leader to take the Church over. Caleb represents the true
       believer who stayed with Joshua. God started Israel as a virgin with His Word. But they wanted
       something different. So did the last-day church.
        My brother, let me tell you something… I’d like to ask you something, where is the Bride of
       Jesus Christ today? Show her to me around the world, you can’t do it! Brother Gatlin…I say
       humbly, said “He traveled all over Europe, Holland and Asia and all over Palestine and
       everywhere, all over the world. And he said, “There was more right here than any place.” He
       said he couldn’t even find the supernatural presence of God other than right here.” So, we feel
       like we’re in terrible condition right here. So, I’m persuaded that there is going to be a bride and
       I want to be a part of it, don’t you? He’s not gonna take her out of here at night with a sack over
       her head, he’s going to show her off. So, “This is My bride right here! Here’s the one that I’ve
       loved and the works that I did, she’s doing them now.” So, we see this.

       OF CHRIST? OH, WHAT A PITY, FRIEND! 216 The hour has come. “His Bride has made

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 4 - The Smyrnaean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       If you think that is an exaggeration, read all of II Timothy chapter 3 and the first five verses of
       the 4th chapter. II Timothy 4:1-5, “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus
       Christ, Who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom; preach the
       Word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and
       doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own
       lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away
       their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure
       afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.” WHEN THE
       CHURCH ALLOWED HERSELF TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL, LIKE ADAM
       AND EVE, DEATH SET IN. THERE IS NO STRENGTH IN HER. She has become a
       monstrosity. The minute the church moved toward form and ceremony, and toward priesthood by
       organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and His
       Word, THAT VERY MOMENT DEATH ENTERED AND SHE STARTED TO GET SICK,
       AND AS SHE GOT SICK SHE CHANGED TO A POWERLESS GROUP OF PEOPLE
       whose only weapon was argument. She could produce nothing in the Spirit, for her hopes were
       built on program and not on faith in His Word. They sowed program so they reaped program.
       THEY SOWED PERVERSION SO THEY REAPED PERVERTED CHILDREN. YOU
       TAMPER WITH GOD AND YOU REAP EXACTLY WHAT YOU INJECTED. Man ought to
       learn that from nature. He has tampered with nature. He has injected his own ideas into nature
       and rearranged the molecules, etcetera, and now he is reaping a whirlwind. Just look how they
       have bred the chicken. It is so highly bred that it is a laying machine that lays itself out. It is no
       good for food and is soft and poor eating. They inject substances into the meat we eat and
       
       18
       because of that the human body is changing so that women are getting narrower in the hips and
       broader of shoulder and men are getting just the opposite. Now if you fool with nature and get a
       monstrosity and a backfire, WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU CHANGE THE TRUTH INTO A
       LIE? THE ANSWER IS, YOU WILL BREED AN ANTICHRIST, GODLESS SYSTEM OF
       RELIGION THAT IS SO PERVERTED IT WILL NOT LOOK LIKE OR PRODUCE WHAT
       THE ORIGINAL DID. The only answer that God has for a situation like that is the lake of fire.
       That poor Smyrnaean Age was dying. When it died, it never came back. No age ever comes back.
       No revival ever comes back. It can’t have the life of God in it by natural generation. It takes a
       regeneration from above. This last age started with the fires of a Pentecostal revival and they
       organized it right back. INSTEAD OF TAKING THE WORD THEY TOOK THEIR OWN
       IDEAS AND DID JUST WHAT EVERY AGE HAS DONE — SUBSTITUTED THE
       MANUAL FOR THE WORD. Just you step outside that manual and see what happens. You are
       out, brother. AND THEY WILL PERSECUTE YOU AND BLAME IT ON GOD. And how they
       love their organization. No wonder. They are second generation Pentecostals and since God
       doesn’t have grandchildren they are just children of their fathers, known by their creeds and
       form of worship. THEY CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT USED TO BE, BUT THEY CAN’T
       PRODUCE IT. Once they had the lightning but about all that is left is the thunder. But let them
       talk to you about the glories of their movement. They will say, “Yes sir, I want you to know that
       this is a move that no man started. It came spontaneously. The Spirit fell all over the world.
       Yes sir, we got what they had at Pentecost. THIS WAS NOT OF MEN BUT OF GOD.” THEN
       WHY DIDN’T THEY KEEP IT THAT WAY? IF GOD STARTED IT HOW COME GOD
       COULDN’T KEEP IT AND FINISH IT? If God didn’t write a handbook of creeds and
       formulas and dogmas to start it, then what right did they have to do that? God poured out His
       Spirit upon Baptists, Methodists, Nazarenes, Adventists, Presbyterians, Brethren, Church of God
       (several so named), etcetera. All these brethren were brought up on different doctrines, by-laws,
       church manuals, etcetera. God swept it all to one side; He destroyed their dispensational
       theories and restored the gifts of the Spirit, proving He is the same yesterday and today and
       forever. But did those Pentecostals learn their lesson about organization? No sir. They
       organized right back and have written their own textbooks, by-laws and church manual,
       fellowship book, etcetera, with one idea in mind, which is to prove that they now have all the
       truth, know all the answers, and are therefore, the elite of God who know the way and can show
       it unto others as God’s appointed guides. BUT THEY HAVEN’T GOT IT. They have hybridized
       themselves like the very groups they came out of. IF THEY WANT TO BE IN THE BRIDE
       THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME OUT EXACTLY AS DID THEIR
       FOREFATHERS. They are like all the rest. The revival is over. THEY ARE TRYING TO
       LIVE A NAME AND ARE DEAD. They took organization, all the while talking about the Spirit
       of God. THEY TALK ABOUT THE EVIDENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. BUT THEY
       FORGET THAT THE DEVIL CAN TALK IN TONGUES, TOO. THE UTTER CONFUSION
       OF BABEL IS IN THEIR MIDST AND THEY CALL IT THE SPIRIT OF GOD. Once again
       we see man telling God, instead of God telling man. Now you might desire to scold me right
       here for what I have said. Alright. They call themselves Pentecostal and Full Gospel. Let them
       prove it. At Pentecost the fire came in a cloud and separated over each of them like a tongue,
       and fell on each one. WHERE IS THE FIRE? THEY SPOKE IN TONGUES AT
       PENTECOST AND THE PEOPLE WHO LISTENED UNDERSTOOD. WHERE IS THAT?
       The whole multitude of believers acted like one family. Pentecostals are as badly divided as
       
       19
       any group in history. No man durst join himself to the early church but only God added. They
       have as many goats among them as any. They claim to be full Gospel but they can’t prove it.
       Their churches are as empty of power as any of them. If they are full Gospel then we had
       better admit the Bible made a mistake when it describes the full Gospel men at Pentecost. They
       sing, “There’s been a great change in me.” They are right. But the change has not been for
       the better. It is time to get back to God. They have a name that they live but are dead. Tongues
       isn’t the evidence of revival. It is the evidence of death. Tongues proclaimed the evidence that
       the ceremonial religion of the Jews was over, that a new era had begun. Tongues today is
       ringing down the curtain on the Gentile church ages and the Gospel is going back to the Jews.
       People are talking about tongues heralding in a great Spiritual move. They have missed the
       boat. The truth is that it is writing the finish to all of man’s ideas, programs and kingdoms, and
       the kingdom of God is being ushered in. WAKE UP PEOPLE OF GOD. WAKE UP. If you
       don’t think this is true, just listen to this. All over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental
       groups they are organizing the businessmen. THEY HAVE INVADED THE PULPIT
       WITHOUT A CALL FROM GOD. They have styled themselves the fishers of men and the
       founders of a move of God, and they say the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4:10-13 that God gave
       the church has failed, so they are taking over. Here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of
       prophecy, called the gainsayings of Korah, and they don’t even know that they have fulfilled it.
       They are blindly going on preaching experience for truth. May God have pity on them. May
       their eyes be opened before it is too late. Oh, listen to me. When did the prestige of money,
       social leadership, business ability, or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for spiritual
       leadership, or give any weight to the Word of God? And when in any way materiality or human
       values begin to show as the media by which God works instead of the Holy Spirit ALONE, then
       we are fighting against God, not for Him.
        The royal seed of faith, faith is a seed, faith is Revelation. You must have a Revelation of God
       to become the royal seed of Abraham.

       unlocked the prison houses. It was faith, the key of faith, that quenched the violence of fire,
       escaped the edge of the sword, brought the dead back to life again. It was faith, the key of faith
       in the living God. That hand, that man, that woman, who can take that key of faith, they can
       unlock every promise God made. But if you haven’t got that key, you’re just progging, you’ll
       never unlock it. You’ll beat against it, because this key… 59 Any correct made key has levers on
       the inside of the lock, and it takes a certain form, a certain shape of them keys to turn those
       levers. And just one little lever out of the way, will mess the whole thing up. 60 THEREFORE, I
       BELIEVE IN THE FULL GOSPEL, EVERY WORD OF GOD, THAT TURNS THE POWER
       OF GOD LOOSE, THAT TURNS HIS BLESSINGS TO THE PEOPLE. IT’S THE KEY TO
       THE DOOR, THAT UNLOCKS IT. Oh, those great heroes, those prophets and great men of
       the Bible, that had that key! That’s the reason they could stop the mouth of lions, quench the
       violence of fire, escape the edge of the sword, bring the dead back to life again, and do all
       kinds of miracles, is because they held that key and they knowed it worked, because it was a
       SCRIPTURE-BORN KEY. 61 Now, if I’m progging with a creed key, I don’t know what it’s
       going to do. If they say “my church teaches this,” I don’t know about that. 62 But when the
       Bible teaches it, and I hold the faith key in my hand, or in my heart, that says “that’s God’s
       Word,” that’ll quench the violence of fire, it’ll unlock healing for the sick, it’ll unlock
       salvation to the lost. I have to come to the Door, everything’s in His Name. “Whatever you do
       in word or deed, do it all in His Name.” Knowing that the key that you got is faith, because it’s
       a Scripture-made key. Now, if it’s a creed key, denominational key, I don’t know what it’ll do.
       But if it’s a Scriptural key, it’ll unlock, because God said so. Now, oh, no wonder they could
       stop the violence of fire, and so forth, they had the key. 63 God’s first nod to one of those
       prophets, nothing could stop them. He didn’t have to do like He does to me some time, pound it
       over and over, and perhaps you (I hope not), but keep telling me, “Go do this,” and then you’ll
       stumble along, “Then go do this,” and “Go back and do it again, you didn’t do it right.” Just
       one little nod! Just, they could just feel the Spirit tell them, “It’s the thing to do,” and nothing’s
       going to stop them. Brother, they—they—they stopped the mouth of lions, they escaped the edge
       of the sword, they quenched fire, they done everything. Just a little nod from God, because they
       held the key in their hand, THAT GREAT FAITH! They done things for God because nothing
       
       21
       will stop them. Oh, how glorious!
       
        And this royal faith is going to come into their inheritance and into their possession. Now
       what we have today is a profession, we profess that we’re Christian, we profess that we believe.
       But we are not able to possess the thing that which God promised, that’s in the book. How many
       say amen to that? (Amen) You got to profess first, before you can possess. We try to possess
       without professing. And to profess means to say Amen to every Word of God in the Bible. And
       then by your profession, you come into a possession. And your possession is your inheritance,
       that’s what you become heir to. And every child of God that goes into the body of the Lord Jesus
       Christ, becomes a joint heir with Christ. That’s why the early church ruled and reigned with
       Christ with great power authority, because they had received an inheritance.
       Hebrews 10:23-Reference quote:
       23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that
       promised;)
       Romans 8:17-Reference quote:
       17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer
       with him, that we may be also glorified together.

       William Marrion Branham
       64 God is just, and He has laws. When those laws are broken… Any law that’s broken, has no
       penalty to it, isn’t law. You cannot break the laws of God without having to pay for it
       somewhere. You must do it. The Bible said, “Be sure your sins will find you out.” 65 And what is
       sin? I’d like to stop here just a moment. Many people think smoking cigarettes is a sin. It isn’t.
       Many people think that lying is a sin. It isn’t. Committing adultery, that isn’t sin. That’s the
       attributes of unbelief. You, the reason you do those things is because you are an unbeliever. 66
       There is only two things, that’s, you are either a believer or an unbeliever. If you are a
       believer, you do not those things. If you do do them, I don’t know what kind of a profession you
       have; but, if you do that, “the love of God isn’t in you.” The Bible said so! WE’VE GOT TOO
       MUCH PROFESSION WITHOUT A POSSESSION OF IT; TOO MANY SAYING, AND
       NOT LIVING IT. 67 I think, even, we have too much practice on sermons, and not living
       enough sermons. It would be a lot better if we lived our sermon, each one of us would be a
       minister. It’s better to live me a sermon than preach me one. The Bible said that, “You are
       written epistles of God, read of all men.” So, it’s best to live the sermon. 68 Sin is because you
       believe not. Did not Jesus say, in the days of His flesh on earth, did He not call…The people that
       would not lie, that would not steal, that would not commit adultery, righteous men, preachers,
       priests, He said, “You are of your father, the devil,” because they believed not on the Son of
       God. “He that believeth not is condemned already.” 69 Sometime ago, I made it, making altar
       calls. I love John 5:24. “He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has
       
       22
       Eternal Life; and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death unto Life.” He that
       believeth! Said, “That’s pretty light.” 70 No, that’s pretty deep, for, “When you believe!” “No
       man can call Jesus ‘the Christ,’ only by the Holy Spirit.” When you have the Holy Spirit, then
       you have believed unto Eternal Life, and have Eternal Life. “He that heareth My Words, and
       believeth on Him that sent Me, has Eternal Life; and shall not come into the judgment, but
       has passed from death unto Life.” Preparation, making ready! 71 And God seen the wickedness
       of the world, and seen that wicked and adulterous generation, and His holiness could not stand it
       anymore. Oh, to this sinful world!

       56-1125E - A Blushing Prophet
       William Marrion Branham
       30 What we need is a revival. We put corn plasters on, take them off; another corn plaster, take
       it off, and still find the pain is there. What we need today is not social regeneration, it’s not
       intellectual talks. What we need today is an old-fashion, God-sent Blood transfusion from
       Heaven. The corn plasters won’t do no good. We are anemia. We need a Blood transfusion. We
       need to come back to the old-fashion Gospel that calls out for repentance before God. And not
       a dry-eyed, hand-shook profession; but a God-sent, Holy Ghost revival with the possession of
       the cleansing of the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ into every human heart. We need a revival
       to start in the Church, and sweep the nation across. We’ll die, we’ll perish, we are gone,
       without that type of revival. 31 I’m so sick and tired of seeing little petty Hollywood revivals, socalled, where people come in and get emotionally stirred up for a couple hours, and, or a day or
       two, or a week or two, and go out and that’s all of it. Brother, you can be in a…worked up by a
       revival. You can have emotion. You can have good intentions. All those things are fine, but we
       don’t need that today. 32 We need a baptism of the Holy Spirit, to change the emotion, and the
       intellect, and the view, the habits, the life of the people, and put them back on the right road
       again. Outside of a Blood transfusion from Calvary, all of our reformations won’t do any good
       at all.
        These angels are sent from the presence of God to minister to the heirs of salvation. Now
       that’s why that the Bride is not doing the great works that are spoken of in the Bible, because
       they are not in their promised land yet. They’re in process of dying out to this old self,
       overcoming this old self and burning it out, and getting all the carnality out, it is the preparation
       for entering into the kingdom of heaven.
       Hebrews 1:14-Reference quote:
       14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of

        And Brother Branham said here in 1965… I just read over here in Page 5, “THAT IT WAS
       THE CHALLENGE OF THE HOUR!” Brother Branham said, if God would raise up some man
       that would challenge the promise of God before the people, and that’s what the duty of the

       William Marrion Branham
       124 But there stood two there, one named Caleb, and one named Joshua, who brought back a
       cluster of grapes, that two men had to pack it. Caleb said, “Quieten yourselves, before the
       prophet. Quieten yourself.” [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit four times—Ed.] He said,
       “We are well able to take it. Let’s go get it, immediately!” 125 WHAT WE NEED IN THIS
       HOUR IS A MAN TO CHALLENGE THE PROMISE OF GOD BEFORE THE PEOPLE.
       GOD PROMISED THE POURING OUT OF THE PENTECOSTAL BLESSING IN THE
       LAST DAYS, I MEAN A REAL PENTECOSTAL POUR OUT, AND IT’S TIME FOR IT TO
       COME. Another Kadesh-barnea has arrived. Yes, sir. 126 They said, “We can well do it. Sure,
       we can do it.” What was it? Those cowardly church members was looking to what they could see
       with their eyes, but Caleb and Joshua was looking to God’s promise. I don’t care how much
       opposition they had, how big the giants looked, how big the fences looked, they were looking to
       God’s promise. 127 AND EVERY A MAN AND WOMAN TONIGHT, THAT WANTS TO GO
       ON WITH GOD, DON’T PAY ANY ATTENTION WHAT THE WORLD SAYS, WHETHER
       WE CAN OR WHETHER WE CAN’T; GOD PROMISED IT, AND THAT SETTLES IT.
       “GOD SAID SO!” I like that. When God says so, that settles it forever. 128 I tell you, tonight.
       We’ve had a whole lot of false pretense. We’ve had a lot of make-up belief. We’ve had a lot of
       stuff that went on for a show. Certainly. The devil always throws his forerunners at you, as a
       counterfeit to scare the people. We’ve had a false Pentecost. We’ve had a false rain. We’ve had a
       false this and that. 129 But in the midst of every bit of it, there’s a genuine baptism of the Holy
       Spirit. There’s a genuine pentecostal blessing, again. There’s a genuine Divine healing.
       There’s a genuine Spirit. There’s a genuine people. And it’s time for the march. That’s right.
       130 The people, at the hour of decision now! You’ve got to make up your mind. This church has
       got to make up its mind. Every man comes to a place where there’s a crucial hour. There was a
       crucial time come where you had to make up your mind. A judgment seat, you was at. You had to
       say, “I am guilty,” or, “I am not guilty.” When you’re standing before the judge, you’ve got to
       make up your mind. 131 And, tonight, the Branham Tabernacle has got to make up its mind.
       We’re either going to go on or go back. That’s right. You’re going back to garlic and—and
       leek, and stuff of Egypt, or you’re going on to Angels’ food, to the promised land where God
       made a promise. WE’RE GOING ON TO AN OLD-FASHION, HOLY GHOST REVIVAL;
       OR YOU’LL BE WISH-WASHY, PACKING AROUND, AND PECKING LIKE A ROBIN ON
       AN APPLE, UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE. You’ve got to make your decision. You can’t go on.
       “Why halt ye between two opinions?” said Elijah. “God be God, serve Him. If He’s not God,
       then don’t serve Him.” 132 If the real experience of God is what takes the sin out of a man’s
       heart, and not belonging to a church, or belonging to a clan, or belonging to an organization,
       which I have nothing to say against. Those things are all right. If…

        Why my, how could anybody could believe that this is the Bride of Christ is more than I can
       understand and read the Bible. Why, the Bride of Christ is to be bone of His bone, flesh of His
       flesh, spirit of His spirit, and power of His power. You cannot separate the Ministry of the Bride
       and Christ, they’re one and the same. Jesus said, “If you see Me, you’ve seen the Father.” Do
       you know anybody goin around saying, “If you seen me you’ve seen the father?” Well, they’re
       going to see it before the rapture. I know, and people hear me preach and think I don’t love
       Brother Branham, I love Brother Branham. What’d that got to do with preaching the Word of
       God. See, it’s heartbreaking. See what it does is it brings shame upon us.
        It brings…All Jeffersonville just laughing and mocking down there. Laughing and mocking
       making fun of everybody going around tellin interpretations. Brother Branham is going to
       resurrect now, today. He won’t! I tell you in the name of the Lord, he won’t! He won’t! If he did
       it’d contradict the Bible. Heavens and earth will pass away but His Word will never pass away!
       He won’t! No sir!
       Luke 21:33-Reference quote:
       33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
        There’s only one thing that will bring the resurrection and that is the Bride of Jesus Christ.

       voice…A SHOUT; AND THEN A VOICE; AND THEN A TRUMPET.
       SHOUT: A MESSENGER GETTING THE PEOPLE READY. THE SECOND IS A VOICE
       OF THE RESURRECTION: THE SAME VOICE, THAT, A LOUD VOICE in Saint John
       11:38-44, that called Lazarus from the grave.
        And if Brother Branham would come up by himself, then you got two on the scene. You’d
       have the friend of the Bridegroom and the Bridegroom himself and it won’t fit the scriptures.
        Know what it is everybody wants to... nobody wants to die and overcome and get that thing
       that Brother Branham got. They wanted brother Branham to do it all for them. Now brother, he’s
       done as much as he can do. Now the church has got to do something or perish. Now that’s not

       William Marrion Branham
       100 You can’t be desperate till God speaks to you. Oh, Church, rise and shake yourself! Pinch
       your conscience, wake yourself up, in this hour! WE MUST BE DESPERATE, OR PERISH!
       There is coming forth something from the Lord! I know it as THUS SAITH THE LORD.
       There is coming forth something, and we better get desperate. It’s between Life and death. It’ll
       pass through us and we won’t see it.
        So, we can see now that the challenge of the hour is to come into the body of Jesus Christ. We
       can fight it, we can butt our heads up against it, but we’ll have to face this, this morning. You’re
       either in the body or out of it, you’re either in the body are out of it, and if you’re in there, you
       ought to be demonstrating your inheritance, see. Remember one man with the true Seal of God
       shook the world. Two men that had it, apostle Paul and Silas went up brother and shook the
       whole country side, even shook the jail down. Let me tell you something brother, if ten people in
       here that had the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning as late as it is, the walls could hardly
       contain it. What it is, we got to come out and face the issue just like it is. What we need brother,
       is honest hearts to come up and face the facts. We’ll never get the job done for Christ like we’re
       doing it now. Notice here this great thing where Paul said, that these spirits are angels coming
       forth to minister to those that are gonna be heirs of this great salvation, see.

       244 GIVE ME A CHURCH, GIVE ME TEN MEN, WHO, REALLY JEWELS OF GOD, THE

       Give me this little houseful of people like that, and I’LL SHOW YOU A LIGHT THAT THE
       WORLD WILL RUN TO IT. That’s right. That’s what God wants us to be. “You’re a city
       setting on a hill.” You’re Royal Seed of Abraham. “It shall possess the gate of its enemy.” 245
       Sickness, there’s a cause for sickness. There’s a cause for these things. AND GOD, THE
       HOLY SPIRIT, IS HERE TO REVEAL THAT THING AND TELL YOU WHY YOU DON’T
       GET IT. WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH US? We don’t have to wonder, “Will It do it.” It’s
       already doing it. WHAT DO YOU DO? 246 Watch that prophet. He listened not to the rushing
       wind, “Glory to God! Hallelujah!” 247 That’s good. Now, remember, I’m not condemning that. I
       hope everybody understands that. Somebody said, “Brother Branham don’t believe in saying,
       ‘Glory to God! Hallelujah!’” Well, look at me up here now. I believe in shouting, speaking with
       
       26
       tongues, dancing in the Spirit. 248 BUT, BROTHER, WHEN YOU FAIL TO HEAR THAT
       STILL SMALL VOICE OF THE WORD, THAT’S THE THING THAT GETS YOU. THAT’S
       THE THING. 249 Elijah knowed all this revival was going on outside. But he was…It never
       attracted him outside to it. But when he heard that still small Voice of God, then he was
       attracted. And he veiled his face, come out. Why? Elijah was the Seed of Abraham,
       FOLLOWING THE WORD. 250 “If ye abide in Me and My Words in you, then ask what you
       will, it’ll be done for you.”
        Now notice here, that Brother Branham said that angels in your midst would one day be as

       64-1221 - Why It Had To Be Shepherd
       William Marrion Branham
       7 Now, that same thing was here when Adam was here. Television was here when—when Elijah
       set on Mount Carmel. It was here when Martin Luther, that young priest, throwed the
       communion on the floor and said, “It’s kosher! And the just shall live by faith.” It was here then,
       but we are just now finding it. And it’s also so, that in our presence tonight is God, Angels,
       supernatural beings that’s unseen to our natural sense of sight. But someday it’ll be a reality
       just as television is now, and just as common. Now, that is why I believe the Word.
       
        Now just look a minute here, something. Now, let’s watch these angels, they play a great part
       here in this end-time.
        Now look at the old covenant saints that were under a covenant of blood of bulls, and goats.
       Look at the angels that minister to them. There we have Moses… just minute, you know how the
       angel appeared to Moses, you know how he came in the desert with him. We know even
       angels… when Moses, when he died on top of the mountain the angels literally come down and
       picked up the natural body of Moses and carried it away with such power and buried it so that
       the devil couldn’t even find it. That’s quite a work isn’t it?
       Deuteronomy 34:4-6-Reference quote:
       4 And the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and
       unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but
       thou shalt not go over thither.
       5 So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the
       Lord.
       6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth–peor: but no man
       knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.

       Jude 1:9-Reference quote:
       9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of
       Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
        Then we have going on down, Joshua going on over into the promise land, which is a type of
       our spiritual promise land today. When he got over there the first thing, he met was a mighty
       angel with a sword in his hand.
       Joshua 5:13-15-Reference quote:
       13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and,
       behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua
       went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
       14 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on
       his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?
       15 And the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the
       place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.
        We goin on down to Daniel. We come down… I’m just picking out a few there’s many in
       there but save time. We find out about the prophet Daniel when he stood for the Word of God,
       and went right on and prayed like he always did, why a…then we find out he was thrown into the
       den of lions by his enemies. But when the king come the next morning expecting nothing left but
       just a one little ole shin bone and the lion licking on it with his tongue. First, he called out, “Oh
       Daniel is thy God able to deliver thee?” Then come a little humble voice out of the cave, “Don’t
       fear king,” Said, “Everything is well, God sent His angels last night and stopped up the mouths
       of the lions. There is no harm to me.”
        So, we find out that coming on down we find even a man Elisha. We find out Elisha when the
       Syrian army came down to take Elisha captive, come down to do him harm. He walked out there
       by his self and his servant was scared to death. Said, “Elisha they’ll kill us.” And the servant was
       scared. And Elisha said, “Lord God let this boy eyes be opened, let him see that there is more
       with us then there are with the Syrian army. And when the little boy’s eyes come open, he seen a
       multitude of angels and chariots of fire, and horses standing all around Elisha. Alright, shows
       you that even angels back under the old covenant, angels ministered to the heirs of a promise
       back there under the old covenant.
        We go on down and find out how angels appeared in all kinds of ways, even to women. Like
       Samson’s mother a appeared to his mother a angel did and told he was gonna be a prophet and
       deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.
        We go on down to even to the times of Jesus Christ, when the angel, Gabriel, appeared to
       Mary and Elizabeth about the same time and gave them a promise of a birth.
        Then we have an angel of the Lord that appeared to Joseph. Then we go on down we find out
       different ways and means angels ministered by.
        Then we find out that even in Genesis the nineteenth chapter when three angels came down to
       visit Abraham, two of them went on down to Sodom and Gomorrah. And those two angels set
       fire to two cities. See, think about that friend, set fire to two cities and burned them up and
       everybody in them.
       
       28
        Then we find out there was a time…And listen, I may get into this tonight or the time I preach
       on these angels. But notice here that these angels do many different jobs, but they minister to the
       heirs of salvation and they also minister wrath and death.
        Notice that when David was provoked by the devil, the devil stood on the side of David and
       provoked David. Provoked David to number how many was in his church. That’s why I never
       say when somebody ask me, “How many do you have in your church? I say, “I don’t know. I
       never counted them and I never will.” It’s not my business to know how many are there. If God
       sends five that’s how many he wants me to have. And he provoked David to number Israel, and
       when he did, an angel came down from heaven with a slaughter whip and a sword in his hand
       and begin to kill the saints by the thousands. And David cried out to God. Lord God, what have
       these little sheep done? It’s my fault that I numbered Israel. Lord God stay thy hand! And the
       Lord said to his angel, “That’s enough!” Said, “Stay your hand don’t kill no more. So, we see it’s
       a fearful thing! Not only do they bring blessing in ministering, but they also bring wrath and
       judgment.
        Notice here ministering to the Lord Jesus. There was the Lord Jesus himself upon mount
       temptation fasting forty days and nights and there tempted by the devil. And after that he was so
       exhausted that angels came and ministered unto the Lord Jesus.
        Then we even find that when Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane and being a natural
       man, a natural man but was a God man too, and He was tempted in all forms just like you and I
       are. See, if you ever get perfected it’ll be because of the grace of God, see. And there was the
       Lord Jesus tempted in all manner like we are, knowing that He had to go to the cross. Jesus
       looked into the Word of God and seen who He was, and played that part out just like you and I
       gotta do. Jesus was a natural human being, but He was the God man.

       William Marrion Branham
       18 Said, “Who is she? Where’d she come from?” And when the harvest was over, the great lord
       of the harvest, which was Boaz, a representative of Christ to the church… He’d fallen in love
       with her, and he wanted to marry her. But before he could marry her, he had to redeem Naomi’s
       lost estate. And before he could redeem her estate, the law, Levitical law was, he had to be a
       kinsman, a near kinsman. When I think of that… The law required him to be a near kinsman,
       her closest kinsman. And he must be worthy, a man of honor. And he must be able to do it
       financially. And then he must make an ensign if he’d redeemed all she had. NOTICE, A
       KINSMAN. GOD… MAN WAS MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD FIRST. AND GOD IS A
       SPIRIT. AND THEN, IN ORDER TO REDEEM THAT MAN, GOD HAD TO COME DOWN
       IN THE FORM OF SINFUL FLESH AND BECOME A KINSMAN. CHRIST (AMEN.);
       CHRIST WAS MADE A KINSMAN. God was made a Kinfolks to us; flesh and blood like we
       are. Amen. What a beautiful story. The whole Bible just ties together everywhere; nothing of It
       out of the way: all ties right together. 19 As Boaz had to be Naomi’s KINSMAN, GOD, TO
       REDEEM THE CHURCH, MUST BE A KINSMAN. And He came down, taken on Himself
       the form of sinful flesh. Amen. He was worthy; He was God’s Son. He had to be worth it: He
       had all the heavens and all the earth.
       
       29
        And there he said, “Lord God if it be possible let this cup pass from me.” And then as he
       prayed three times and then the enemy come to pick Him up, and take him prisoner and Peter
       took a sword and cut off the ear of one of the high priest servants, smote off his ear and Jesus
       told him, “Put up your sword, would you not know that I could call for twelve legions of angels
       and get them?” Do you know how many twelve legions of angels are? An innumerable number,
       so many that you can’t count them. He said don’t you know I could just speak the Word and
       called for twelve legions of angels would come by my father, and slay everybody in Jerusalem if
       I wanted them to.” He said, “No man takes my life from me, I’M LAYING IT DOWN THAT I
       MIGHT TAKE IT UP AGAIN! I’ll raise it up. I’ll raise it up again. I’m laying it down; I have
       power to lay it down AND I GOT POWER TO TAKE IT UP AGAIN. I’ll raise it up again. I’M
       LAYING IT DOWN I GOT POWER TO LAY IT DOWN AND I GOT POWER TO TAKE IT
       UP. Amen, think about that! It was nothing short of God Himself.
       John 10:17-18-Reference quote:
       17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
       18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have
       power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

       William Marrion Branham
       I said, “No, He was Jehovah.” People try to push Him around, saying He’s just good man, an
       ordinary man. He was the divine One, God manifested in the flesh, seen of angels, preached on,
       received up into the heavens, setting at the right hand of the Father. Certainly, He was God. He
       was more than a man. HE WAS A GOD-MAN. HE WAS MAN IN FLESH but He was God in
       Spirit. That’s what He was, God coming down to suffer temptation and martyrdom, to take
       sins upon Himself, that he’d passed on the human race, bearing our sins Himself.
        Now we can see how these ministering angels played a tremendous part in the ministry of the
       Old Testament saints who were heirs of salvation. Now notice that they only came to those that
       were heirs, they was always the ones that were hanging on and believing a promise.
        See, now notice, that after the Lord Jesus… let’s bring it on down and let’s take the apostles.
       Now, notice that there were no angels ministering to the apostles at all. Until after the Holy Spirit
       the Seal of God was given to the believers on the day Pentecost. But now notice that after they
       had believed the promise of God. Right? Go down to Jerusalem and tarry until you be endued
       with power from on high. And then go ye into all the world and preach this same gospel that I’ve
       preached, heal the sick, cleanse leprosy and raise the dead, open the blinded eyes, and shake the
       world. Is that right? That’s what He said!
        Now notice, they had no ministry of angels to the hundred and twenty that was following the
       Lord Jesus in his third pull. They had no ministration of angels. But now notice right after they
       went and obeyed the promise of the hour… and I believe that’s the same promise of this hour
       brother. If this message is ever going to accomplish anything for God, IT’S GOING TO TAKE

       through Georgia and clear down to Florida and down into California, if everybody would take
       God right at His Word. Where He said, “Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is
       come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me into all the world!”
       Acts 1:8-Reference quote:
       8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be
       witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judæa, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost
       part of the earth.
        The thing about it there isn’t anybody willing to wait for God to do something. We want to
       take an imitation - something carnal, something natural. I THANK GOD THAT HE RAISED UP
       MAN LIKE WILLIAM BRANHAM THAT BROUGHT A REAL THING TO THIS EARTH.
       He brought a real Jesus Christ and His resurrected power and His glory and he shook nations for
       Christ. BROTHER IF ONE MAN COULD SHAKE NATIONS, WHAT DO YOU THINK
       ABOUT A BRIDE OF FIVE-HUNDRED FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. Brother, we
       can take this mountain for God. If we just need to get unified around the promise of God.

       62-0128A - A Paradox
       William Marrion Branham
       76 It was a paradox when He went to choose His church, that He chose fishermen instead of
       priests. That’s contrary to nature. Look like He’d had a great big church, with all bunch of
       ministers all shined up and polished up, and knows their theology, and got all their Ph.D’s, and
       everything. That’s where He come to. But He just bypassed the whole bunch, went down and
       got some fishermen that couldn’t even sign their own name. The Bible said that Peter and
       John was ignorant and unlearned. That’s who He got for His church. That’s a paradox.
       Certainly. Yes, sir. He chose fishermen, instead of men—instead of priests. 77 Now, we find
       out that on the day of Pentecost… It’s strange that He chose a bunch of unlearned people,
       and sent them up there with a commission at Pentecost—not to go to some seminary, BUT TO
       WAIT UNTIL THEY WAS ENDUED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH. If that man Peter,
       and John and them, wanted to preach and they were ignorant and unlearned, look like He’d
       said, “Boys, there’s a fine school right over here. You go till you learn your ABC’s. Then after
       you do that, you’ll take your grammar school. Get it all, that through. Then you’ll take four
       years of high school, then four years of college, and then about four or five years of Bible
       School. Then you can go out.” But He said, “WAIT IN THE CITY OF JERUSALEM, for I’m
       going to send the promise of the Father upon you. And THEN you’ll be witnesses of Me (Luke
       24:49), witnesses of Me in Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the
       earth.” That’s still His requirement.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 4 - The Smyrnaean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       If you think that is an exaggeration, read all of II Timothy chapter 3 and the first five verses of
       the 4th chapter. II Timothy 4:1-5, “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus
       Christ, Who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom; preach the
       Word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and
       doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own
       lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away
       their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure
       afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.” When the church
       allowed herself to move away from the original, like Adam and Eve, death set in. There is no
       strength in her. She has become a monstrosity. The minute the church moved toward form and
       ceremony, and toward priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided
       leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and His Word, that very moment death entered and she
       started to get sick, and as she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only
       weapon was argument. She could produce nothing in the Spirit, for her hopes were built on
       program and not on faith in His Word. They sowed program so they reaped program. They
       sowed perversion so they reaped perverted children. You tamper with God and you reap
       exactly what you injected. Man ought to learn that from nature. He has tampered with nature.
       He has injected his own ideas into nature and rearranged the molecules, etcetera, and now he is
       reaping a whirlwind. Just look how they have bred the chicken. It is so highly bred that it is a
       laying machine that lays itself out. It is no good for food and is soft and poor eating. They inject
       substances into the meat we eat and because of that the human body is changing so that women
       are getting narrower in the hips and broader of shoulder and men are getting just the opposite.
       Now if you fool with nature and get a monstrosity and a backfire, what will happen if you
       change the truth into a lie? The answer is, you will breed an antichrist, godless system of
       religion that is so perverted it will not look like or produce what the original did. The only
       answer that God has for a situation like that is the lake of fire. That poor Smyrnaean Age was
       dying. When it died, it never came back. No age ever comes back. No revival ever comes back. It
       
       32
       can’t have the life of God in it by natural generation. It takes a regeneration from above. This
       last age started with the fires of a Pentecostal revival and they organized it right back.
       INSTEAD OF TAKING THE WORD THEY TOOK THEIR OWN IDEAS AND DID JUST
       WHAT EVERY AGE HAS DONE — SUBSTITUTED THE MANUAL FOR THE WORD.
       Just you step outside that manual and see what happens. You are out, brother. AND THEY
       WILL PERSECUTE YOU AND BLAME IT ON GOD. And how they love their organization.
       No wonder. They are second generation Pentecostals and since God doesn’t have grandchildren
       they are just children of their fathers, known by their creeds and form of worship. THEY CAN
       TALK ABOUT WHAT USED TO BE, BUT THEY CAN’T PRODUCE IT. Once they had the
       lightning but about all that is left is the thunder. But let them talk to you about the glories of their
       movement. They will say, “Yes sir, I want you to know that this is a move that no man started.
       It came spontaneously. The Spirit fell all over the world. Yes sir, we got what they had at
       Pentecost. THIS WAS NOT OF MEN BUT OF GOD.” THEN WHY DIDN’T THEY KEEP IT
       THAT WAY? IF GOD STARTED IT HOW COME GOD COULDN’T KEEP IT AND
       FINISH IT? If God didn’t write a handbook of creeds and formulas and dogmas to start it, then
       what right did they have to do that? God poured out His Spirit upon Baptists, Methodists,
       Nazarenes, Adventists, Presbyterians, Brethren, Church of God (several so named), etcetera. All
       these brethren were brought up on different doctrines, by-laws, church manuals, etcetera. God
       swept it all to one side; He destroyed their dispensational theories and restored the gifts of the
       Spirit, proving He is the same yesterday and today and forever. But did those Pentecostals
       learn their lesson about organization? No sir. They organized right back and have written their
       own textbooks, by-laws and church manual, fellowship book, etcetera, with one idea in mind,
       which is to prove that they now have all the truth, know all the answers, and are therefore, the
       elite of God who know the way and can show it unto others as God’s appointed guides. But they
       haven’t got it. They have hybridized themselves like the very groups they came out of. If they
       want to be in the bride they are going to have to come out exactly as did their forefathers. They
       are like all the rest. The revival is over. THEY ARE TRYING TO LIVE A NAME AND ARE
       DEAD. They took organization, all the while talking about the Spirit of God. THEY TALK
       ABOUT THE EVIDENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. BUT THEY FORGET THAT THE
       DEVIL CAN TALK IN TONGUES, TOO. THE UTTER CONFUSION OF BABEL IS IN
       THEIR MIDST AND THEY CALL IT THE SPIRIT OF GOD. Once again we see man telling
       God, instead of God telling man. Now you might desire to scold me right here for what I have
       said. Alright. They call themselves Pentecostal and Full Gospel. Let them prove it. At Pentecost
       the fire came in a cloud and separated over each of them like a tongue, and fell on each one.
       WHERE IS THE FIRE? THEY SPOKE IN TONGUES AT PENTECOST AND THE
       PEOPLE WHO LISTENED UNDERSTOOD. WHERE IS THAT? The whole multitude of
       believers acted like one family. Pentecostals are as badly divided as any group in history. No
       man durst join himself to the early church but only God added. They have as many goats among
       them as any. They claim to be full Gospel but they can’t prove it. Their churches are as empty
       of power as any of them. If they are full Gospel then we had better admit the Bible made a
       mistake when it describes the full Gospel men at Pentecost. They sing, “There’s been a great
       change in me.” They are right. But the change has not been for the better. It is time to get
       back to God. They have a name that they live but are dead. Tongues isn’t the evidence of
       revival. It is the evidence of death. Tongues proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial
       religion of the Jews was over, that a new era had begun. Tongues today is ringing down the
       
       33
       curtain on the Gentile church ages and the Gospel is going back to the Jews. People are talking
       about tongues heralding in a great Spiritual move. They have missed the boat. The truth is that
       it is writing the finish to all of man’s ideas, programs and kingdoms, and the kingdom of God is
       being ushered in. WAKE UP PEOPLE OF GOD. WAKE UP. If you don’t think this is true, just
       listen to this. All over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing
       the businessmen. THEY HAVE INVADED THE PULPIT WITHOUT A CALL FROM GOD.
       They have styled themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of God, and they say
       the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4:10-13 that God gave the church has failed, so they are taking
       over. Here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy, called the gainsayings of
       Korah, and they don’t even know that they have fulfilled it. They are blindly going on
       preaching experience for truth. May God have pity on them. May their eyes be opened before
       it is too late. Oh, listen to me. When did the prestige of money, social leadership, business
       ability, or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for spiritual leadership, or give any weight
       to the Word of God? And when in any way materiality or human values begin to show as the
       media by which God works instead of the Holy Spirit ALONE, then we are fighting against God,
       not for Him.
        People say, “That poor ole Brother Lambert up there in Connecticut telling everybody God is
       going to pour out His Spirit.” IT’S THUS SAITH THE LORD!! WAIT AND SEE IF IT
       DON’T! Why it’s pulsating in my heart for twelve years and showed to me by GOD HIMSELF!
       I see it in the Word of God and I see it on the tapes.
        I believe that Brother Branham was the first fruits brother. I believe he was the wave offering,
       I believe he was the first son to prove that Jesus Christ is not dead but He’s alive for evermore.
       And I believe brother with all my heart, I BELIEVE THERE’S A MANY MEMBERED BODY
       COMING FORTH, THAT’S GONNA SHAKE THIS WORLD UNDER THE IMPACT OF
       THE HOLY GHOST. What we need is men and women that’ll be honest with God and say, I’m
       poor in spirit, I’m a mess, but God come and clean me up and get me ready so you can use me
       for His glory. That’s what we need! If God had one-hundred and twenty that went up there and
       tarried until God came and fulfilled His promise.
        And brother, if that first church went out of there with power and they wrote another Book of
       Acts behind it, brother will there anything be left when this prophet of God restores the Word of
       God? Will there not be a restoration of power and an out pouring of the Holy Ghost, that’ll catch
       this Bride out of here? Will not even the last day be greater than the first, when it’s the end of all
       things?

       Christ, and that is our Token that all that we have need of is already purchased by Him. We are
       identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 117 The Blood, Covenant Blood, is not
       recognized without the Token. The Word assures us of the promise. The Token is the sign the
       purchase has been made for us. 118 Full obedience to the full Word of God entitles us to the
       
       34
       Token. No other way is there, that you could ever be entitled to the Token, until you fully obey
       the Word. Not what somebody has put into It, and added to It; but what God said about It! 119
       When He said, “You must be born again.” That don’t mean jump up-and-down at the altar; that
       don’t mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor; that don’t mean all this foolishness
       that we’ve seen done; it don’t mean putting your name on a church book. It means death to your
       first being, and Life to the second being. It means that the Blood has been applied, and you’re
       identified by the Life of Jesus Christ. And if He be the Vine, and we be the branches, the Life
       that’s in the branch is in also from the Vine. It’ll bear the fruit. 120 IF THAT FIRST
       BRANCH COME FORTH, THAT BRANCH OUT OF THAT VINE, THAT WROTE A
       BOOK OF ACTS BEHIND IT; IF THAT BRANCH EVER PUTS FORTH, A VINE PUTS
       FORTH ANOTHER BRANCH, THEY’LL WRITE ANOTHER BOOK OF ACTS BEHIND
       IT, ’CAUSE IT’S THE SAME LIFE. If a one of your grapevines out here brings forth blue
       grapes, if it puts forth another branch, it’ll bring forth blue grapes. 121 And I tell you, today, we
       got so many grafted vines into It, with denominations and creeds and things, AND YET ANY
       CITRUS FRUIT GRAFTED IN CAN LIVE, LIVE IN THAT VINE. BUT IT’S BEARING
       THE WRONG FRUIT. 122 WHAT WE NEED, TODAY, IS ANOTHER BAPTISM OF THE
       HOLY SPIRIT, AND HAVE THE REAL POWER OF GOD THAT IDENTIFIES THE
       WORKS THAT JESUS CHRIST PROMISED FOR THIS DAY, NOT SO MUCH AS THAT
       DAY. This day, the promise that He made here. That was what He promised there, He would
       pour out His Spirit. Now He has promised it again in the last days, and what He would do.
       
        There never was an hour with the amount of unbelief as there is now, and as much demon
       power as there are. BUT I BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS NOT COMING TO SUFFER
       AND DIE TODAY. HE’S COMING IN POWER. HE’S COMING TO CONQUER ALL OF
       HIS ENEMIES. Amen! I BELIEVE HE’LL PUT EVERY ENEMY UNDER HIS FOOT. I don’t

       “I’M THE VIRGIN BORN SON OF GOD. I COME DOWN FROM THE FATHER’S

       He’s at. I can see Him coming back up. It’s coming towards daylight. There’s some more
       
       35
       people up there, the Old Testament saints. They couldn’t go to heaven. They had to stay in
       Paradise, ’cause the blood of bulls and goats won’t take away sin. It just covers sin. But Jesus
       has shed His Blood that divorces sin, puts her away, wipes her out. I can see Him. There’s
       another place up there called Paradise. I can hear the door [Brother Branham knocks six
       times—Ed.] Somebody says, “Who’s there?” Open the door Abraham. Said, “Sarah come here;
       come here, Sarah. That’s the Man that I entertained that day under the oak tree.” Hallelujah.
       There He is. That’s Him. Daniel said, “What’d you say? Well, well, that’s the Rock that I saw
       hewed out of the mountain without hands.” 46 There come Ezekiel say, “I seen Him, and He
       was in the heavens, and the clouds looked like dust under His feet.” He said, “Boys, you all
       have believed under the shedding of the sacrifices of blood of bulls and goats, but sin is divorced
       now.” We’re going up. Don’t you remember what David said in the Psalms? ‘He let captive
       captives and give gifts to man.’?” “Yes, I remember what David said. I believed it too. “I know
       you did, come on.” I hear Abraham say, “Lord, the God of Abraham.” Oh, my, I can hear him
       say, “Can we make a little whistle-stop in Jerusalem? “Yes, I got forty days. I want to instruct
       My disciples. They got to go in the world and cast out devils and things. I better talk to them a
       little while before the going up. So you fellows can just walk around a little while. Hurry up
       now. It’s coming towards daylight, be Easter morning pretty soon.” 47 My, I can see the big
       morning star a looking around over the skies, comes down like a whirlwind, hits on the grave,
       and open comes the grave. And angels stood there… He rose up and so did the Old Testament
       saints. The Bible said so. Matthew 27 says, “Many of those who slept in the dust of the earth,
       rose and come with Him, after His resurrection. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob (Hallelujah.) went in
       with Him after the resurrection. My, I can see Him stand over there as they come from Emmaus
       and was talking. He walked along with them and beat them back over there, walked right in the
       room and said, “Touch My hand, see… Give Me something to eat. Give Me a piece of bread and
       fish. Does a spirit eat like I eat?” 48 I can see Abraham and Sarah with their arms around one
       another coming down the street, said, “Sarah, the old place don’t look like it used to. Nope. It
       feels good to be back here again doesn’t it, Sarah?” “Yes, sir, it sure does.” Caiaphas, I can see
       him standing there, a high priest saying, “This racket about that resur… Say, who is that—that
       young couple—couple going there?” Abraham says, “Sarah, we’re recognized.” Vanished out
       of there with that same kind of a body just like His own glorious body. We’re going to have
       one, one of these days. Hallelujah. Just like He went through the wall without seeing… He
       vanished out of their sight.

       Well, see, there’s where I do wrong. One time should settle it forever (See?) With every
       congregation. It can be really proven of God and from the Scripture, and God does it one time,
       that should settle it. 4 Every time Moses… Could you imagine meet—meeting someone, say,
       “Now, wait a minute; I want to show you the Lord sent me. See, my hand’s leprosy now. Now it’s
       clean. See this stick? It’s a snake. Now it’s a stick.” Wait and get to the next Hebrew and say,
       “Now here, here’s my hand; it’s leprosy.” Oh, no. He did it one time, and that’s it. See? They all
       believed it. But the Lord never sent me to do all this; I do it upon my own accord. And that’s the
       reason it bothers me so bad. SOON, THERE’S SOMETHING GREATER THAN THIS
       COMING; IT’LL SOON BE HERE. IT’LL BE MARVELOUS THEN, if the Lord willing.
       How many ever read my last vision that’s been wrote up in the magazine? WAIT TILL YOU
       SEE THAT TAKE PLACE. THEN THIS WILL BE MINOR. WHAT THE LORD’S FIX…
       IT’LL JUST KEEP GOING ON AND ON, ON AND ON. JESUS IS COMING. THE TIME
       
       37
       OF THE GATHERING OF THE PEOPLE IS AT HAND. AND WE MUST LOOK
       FORWARD TO GREAT THINGS TO HAPPEN. 5 How many read the sermon, “When
       Omnipotence Speaks, Miracles Happen”? Did you? You believe that? Certainly. Omnipotent
       spoke at ever junction. And when the Church cooled off, and, then Omnipotence spoke; miracles
       takes place. And this is the junction of all junctions; this is the end time. The end of the whole
       history of the world is right now at hand. SO YOU CAN EXPECT OMNIPOTENCE TO
       SPEAK, AND YOU CAN EXPECT THE GREATEST AND MIGHTIEST MIRACLES
       THAT’S EVER HAPPENED ON THE EARTH will happen in the next few years to come, if
       Jesus tarries. It will be. Then watch for Satan to raise up his too. When—when all heaven
       turns loose, all hell turns loose too. And it’s prophesied that there’d be a Jannes and Jambres
       on the earth in the last days, who would almost impersonate the real thing so close it’d deceive
       the very Elect if possible. See? So we’re looking for all of that. 6 So my Christian friend, the best
       thing for you to do, and I to do, is to stay just as close to the Lord Jesus as we can. Love Him and
       pray daily that God will help us and guide us, that we’ll be on His side when the end finally
       comes. That’s our desire of our heart. And I’m sure if we’re sincere in our heart, and study His
       Word, and receive all that He has for us, we’ll not be deceived by the antichrist and his—his
       power. Did you notice? The antichrist can do everything but heal. He can’t heal. Did you notice
       Jannes and Jambres when they stood against Moses, they could do everything but heal. They
       could bring curses, but they couldn’t take it away. See? God’s the only Healer there is. He’s the
       only One can heal. And today we have the finest hospitals we ever had, finest doctors we’ve ever
       had, smartest doctors, the best doctors, the best drugs we ever practiced with. Don’t you believe
       that? And we got more sickness than we ever had. Why? WE GOT MORE SIN AND
       UNBELIEF THEN WE EVER HAD. UNBELIEF IS SIN.
        It’s terrible! We’re living in the hour right now. What is it? The devil has blinded the people
       that love the prophet of God. Do you know I hate to say this, but I’m duty-bound as a minister of
       the Word of God. Did you know the great labors and sufferings and heartache that prophet went
       through to get an apostolic church? And now the Branham Tabernacle is filled with all kinds of
       hateful unclean spirits, fighting and fussing with one another. We’ll never be able to prove that
       William Branham was Elijah the prophet like that. HE CAME AND SUFFERED AND DIED
       TO GET A BRIDE FOR CHRIST. Oh God, help men and women to see that. If we loved him,
       why won’t we do the things that he said to do! How can a man love William Branham and set up
       there and watch an ole dirty nasty filthy television set? Still women trim their hair, still wearing
       them short dresses, and claim to be a believer. I DON’T BELIEVE THAT! I BELIEVE ITS
       REPENT! THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND! GOD’S GETTING READY TO
       CALL A BRIDE OUT OF HERE, AND FILL HER WITH THE HOLY GHOST. Amen!
       Matthew 4:16-17-Reference quote:
       16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and
       shadow of death light is sprung up.
       17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at
       hand.

       62-1104M - Blasphemous Names
       William Marrion Branham
       135 Now you say, “Brother Branham, do we, should we speak with tongues?” Absolutely.
       That’s gifts of God. BUT THOSE GIFTS OF GOD, WITHOUT THESE VIRTUES IN
       THEM, MAKES A STUMBLE BLOCK TO THE UNBELIEVER. IT’S NOT ACCEPTED BY
       GOD. 136 THIS HAS TO BE FIRST. AND WHEN YOU HAVE FAITH, VIRTUE,
       KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE, PATIENCE, GODLINESS, AND BROTHERLY LOVE,
       THEN THE HOLY GHOST COMES DOWN AND SEALS YOU AS A UNIT, THE SAME AS
       HE SEALS THE CHURCH AGES AS A UNIT. The way He makes His Bride is the way He
       makes His individual; made out of same material, like Eve was made out of Adam, a rib from
       the side. Here is the things that you have to have first. YOU CAN’T IMPERSONATE THEM.
       YOU CAN’T IMITATE THEM. THEY’VE GOT TO BE GOD-SENT AND GOD-BORN.
       IMITATION ONLY CAUSES CONFUSION. 137 It’s like I said. Could you imagine seeing a
       buzzard setting there with a dove feather stuck in his wings, say, “See, I’m a dove!” He’s not a
       dove. He’s a buzzard, vulture. Could you imagine a black bird with a peacock feather in his
       wings, and saying, “See!”? That’s something that he stuck in. 138 But it has to come from the
       inside out, and it produces Christianity; God, by the power of the Holy Spirit! 139 Our sister
       had her feet wet when she got to the bottom. All of us know Sister Shepherd to be charitable. Her
       house is open. Her and brother, I don’t care if it’s a bum, beggar, whatever it is, they’ll feed him,
       do anything they can to help him along. Oh! God accepted that, her foundation part.140 And
       here’s, now, get this lesson. Here is what’s wrong with the—with the…I turn on for this. HERE
       IS WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE BRANHAM TABERNACLE. You see, there is two
       different kinds of faith. There is two different kinds of virtue, as I had it the other day. Two
       different kinds of knowledge. Two different kinds of temperance. 141 One thinks it’s
       prohibition, they got. That ain’t the kind of temperance that God is talking about. It’s that
       ungodly, uncontrollable temper you got, and things of that side, fast back, fuss. 142 Patience,
       and so forth, there’s a mockery of it, a pretending to be; a nature-given faith; a nature-given
       virtue. There’s a nature-given temperance. All these things are nature given. 143 And the
       biggest part of our faith is mental faith. By hearing the Word, it brings us to a mental
       recognition of God.

       William Marrion Branham
       174 Excuse us, strangers, I’m giving the church a little Gospel spanking now. Notice, that’s
       right. It’s exactly what you need. 175 “Oh,” you say, “we got It.” And get up there and beat the
       piano as hard as it can go, and a bunch of drums, and run up and down the floor, and go out and
       fuss with your neighbor. Have you got anything? Uh-huh. No, sir. The only thing we got is a
       lukewarm. As long as the music is running, we’re running. When the music stops, we stop.
       Brother, don’t call the other fellow something; let’s look around your own door, first. Amen. 176
       I tell you, we need an old-fashion revival like we used to have down in the country, when they
       
       39
       lay on their face all night long. Not to carry on, but when real godly sorrow; and not go back
       to the altar and stay, but go out and make it right with the neighbors they had made it wrong
       with, and get straightened up. You know that’s right. Scorching, but, brother, it’ll help you.
       That’s right. You’ve got to know that, my friend. Yes, sir. 177 A lukewarm, that’s a horrible
       condition for the church to be in. You don’t watch, the Branham Tabernacle is about in that
       same way. Listen, you know these things. It’s been taught, year after year, after year, after
       year, over this platform, warning you of these things coming. When, the Bible said there would
       be a time they’d go from the east to the west, and north and south, trying to find the true Word
       of God, and fail to find It. You better get anchored, where you know where you’re standing.
       178 But when a man is once borned again; not emotionally worked up, not some enthusiasm, not
       by putting his name on a church book, not by joining the biggest church in the city. But when
       he’s actually cried through, and begged, with tears in his eyes, until God has forgive his sins,
       cleansed his soul up from a life of sin, and filled him with the Holy Spirit; with such love, and
       godly, till he takes them old tire tools back, he stole from the neighbors, and goes and makes up
       to these things, and lives godly before men. We’ll never have a revival in this country till we
       have that. [Brother Branham knocked on the pulpit four times—Ed.] 179 Judgment begins at
       the house of God, by the Word of God. Amen. Not a textbook, but the Bible. Not what some
       church teaches in their theology, but what God says. Then you’ll have a revival where great
       powers, and wonders, and signs, and miracles, and everything else, will take place. 180 We’re
       lukewarm. Because we’re lukewarm in this age, God said, “I’ll spue you from My mouth.”
       This church age will be rejected. There’ll be a remnant out of it, that’ll be saved. So better
       mark yourself, right good, to find out if you’re in that remnant now. We’ll get into it in a
       minute, if God willing. Just notice now.
        The prophet of God said to the Branham Tabernacle, “You’ll either go on to a Saint Paul, sky
       blue, sin-killing revival, or you’ll be picking around on an old rotten apple all the days of your
       life.” What’s the matter with the Branham Tabernacle? Why can’t it come out of these wrinkles
       that it’s in? It’s in more wrinkles now than it ever was, antichrist spirits and everything else.

       56-0527 - At Kadesh-Barnea
       William Marrion Branham
       121 The Kadesh-barnea come to the place where there had to be a judgment. And Moses chose
       twelve, one out of each tribe, and he sent them over to spy out the land. 122 When they come
       back, I wish you would notice what a report! “Oh,” they said, “it’s a goodly land. Oh, it’s a
       wonderful land. It’s flowing with milk and honey.” 123 “But,” ten of them said, “we can’t take
       it. We can’t take it. Oh,” said, “we met the—the Amorites, the Midianites, and—and the
       Canaanites, and all that. Why, we looked like grasshoppers, aside of them. They are great big
       fellows. And their cities are all walled in, and there’s no way for us to ever get in. Oh, our hearts
       are fainting within us. We can’t take it.” And, the popular vote of the people, the people
       received it. 124 But there stood two there, one named Caleb, and one named Joshua, who
       brought back a cluster of grapes, that two men had to pack it. Caleb said, “Quieten yourselves,
       
       40
       before the prophet. Quieten yourself.” [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit four times—
       Ed.] He said, “We are well able to take it. Let’s go get it, immediately!” 125 WHAT WE NEED
       IN THIS HOUR IS A MAN TO CHALLENGE THE PROMISE OF GOD BEFORE THE
       PEOPLE. GOD PROMISED THE POURING OUT OF THE PENTECOSTAL BLESSING
       IN THE LAST DAYS, I MEAN A REAL PENTECOSTAL POUR OUT, AND IT’S TIME
       FOR IT TO COME. Another Kadesh-barnea has arrived. Yes, sir. 126 They said, “We can well
       do it. Sure, we can do it.” What was it? Those cowardly church members was looking to what
       they could see with their eyes, but Caleb and Joshua was looking to God’s promise. I don’t care
       how much opposition they had, how big the giants looked, how big the fences looked, they were
       looking to God’s promise. 127 AND EVERY A MAN AND WOMAN TONIGHT, THAT
       WANTS TO GO ON WITH GOD, DON’T PAY ANY ATTENTION WHAT THE WORLD
       SAYS, WHETHER WE CAN OR WHETHER WE CAN’T; GOD PROMISED IT, AND
       THAT SETTLES IT. “GOD SAID SO!” I like that. When God says so, that settles it forever.
       128 I tell you, tonight. We’ve had a whole lot of false pretense. We’ve had a lot of make-up
       belief. We’ve had a lot of stuff that went on for a show. CERTAINLY. THE DEVIL ALWAYS
       THROWS HIS FORERUNNERS AT YOU, AS A COUNTERFEIT TO SCARE THE
       PEOPLE. WE’VE HAD A FALSE PENTECOST. WE’VE HAD A FALSE RAIN. WE’VE
       HAD A FALSE THIS AND THAT. 129 But in the midst of every bit of it, there’s a genuine
       baptism of the Holy Spirit. There’s a genuine pentecostal blessing, again. There’s a genuine
       Divine healing. There’s a genuine Spirit. There’s a genuine people. And it’s time for the
       march. That’s right. 130 THE PEOPLE, AT THE HOUR OF DECISION NOW! YOU’VE
       GOT TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND. THIS CHURCH HAS GOT TO MAKE UP ITS MIND.
       EVERY MAN COMES TO A PLACE WHERE THERE’S A CRUCIAL HOUR. THERE WAS
       A CRUCIAL TIME COME WHERE YOU HAD TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND. A
       JUDGMENT SEAT, YOU WAS AT. You had to say, “I am guilty,” or, “I am not guilty.” When
       you’re standing before the judge, you’ve got to make up your mind. 131 AND, TONIGHT,
       THE BRANHAM TABERNACLE HAS GOT TO MAKE UP ITS MIND. WE’RE EITHER
       GOING TO GO ON OR GO BACK. THAT’S RIGHT. YOU’RE GOING BACK TO GARLIC
       AND—AND LEEK, AND STUFF OF EGYPT, OR YOU’RE GOING ON TO ANGELS’
       FOOD, TO THE PROMISED LAND WHERE GOD MADE A PROMISE. WE’RE GOING
       ON TO AN OLD-FASHION, HOLY GHOST REVIVAL; OR YOU’LL BE WISH-WASHY,
       PACKING AROUND, AND PECKING LIKE A ROBIN ON AN APPLE, UNTIL THE DAY
       YOU DIE. You’ve got to make your decision. You can’t go on. “Why halt ye between two
       opinions?” said Elijah. “God be God, serve Him. If He’s not God, then don’t serve Him.” 132
       If the real experience of God is what takes the sin out of a man’s heart, and not belonging to a
       church, or belonging to a clan, or belonging to an organization, which I have nothing to say
       against. Those things are all right. If…
        Let me tell you something, the devil is making good people into idolaters today. Let me tell
       you something, I don’t care how great a man is, I don’t care how great of a prophet come you get
       your eyes off Jesus Christ and God is duty bound to take him away. God won’t share his glory
       with no man. We’re to be in love with the Lord Jesus, and Him alone. We’re to thank God for
       the ministry, but there’s no good in any man. William Branham was a sinner saved by grace. He
       
       41
       was what he was by the grace of God and you’ll be what you’re gonna be by the grace of God.

       morning, no more would happen. Or, if you would believe with the measure of faith, that, no
       more could happen than what will happen, if you believe with the same measure of faith.
       Because, I only represent Him. I’m a sinner saved by grace, just a man like you are, just a
       human being. But God has to have an outlet somewhere. And He’s proved that by His Word.
       He’s proved it by the ministry. He’s proved it by the Angel of the Lord. And here it is. Now it’s

       understand it. Say, “Oh, you’re Jesus…you’re—you’re the Christ,” rather. 122 He said, “I am
       not the Christ.” He said, “I’m not worthy to loose His shoes. But,” he said, “He is standing
       among you, somewhere,” for he was sure that He would be there. He would be in his day,
       ’cause God told him he was to introduce the Messiah.
        But still we could have had the great power of God in our churches and our assemblies.
       Brother Branham said that every assembly ought to have be apostolic assembly. Every assembly
       out to be on fire for God. Every assembly ought to be filled with the Holy Ghost. Every assembly

       OF THE HOLY GHOST, PREACHED WITH POWER, IT’LL SCORCH THEM. THAT’S

       53-0614A - Earnestly Contending For The Faith That Was Once Delivered To The Saints
       William Marrion Branham
       Now, we’ve had plenty of passing out tracts and theology around the world. But the Gospel is
       not the Bible altogether. The—the Bible… Paul said, “The Gospel came to us not in Word only,
       but through power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost.” Then when Jesus said, “Go into
       all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature,” then He meant go into all the world
       and demonstrate the power of God to every creature. 13 AND IN ORDER TO PREACH THE
       GOSPEL, BEFORE YOU CAN MAKE IT A GOSPEL PREACH, THEN YOU’VE GOT TO
       HAVE THE POWER AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO PROVE THE
       GOSPEL. “The letter killeth, the Word… the letter killeth, the Spirit maketh alive.” So it’s not
       just a ritualistic affair, but it’s absolutely a real, living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
       living among men. And that’s the faith that I’m trying my best to contend for today; that Jesus
       Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever and His power is unlimited.

       53 The secondhanded robe, but when you come to Jordan you’ve got to have the God of
       Pentecost. He wanted the God of Elijah. If the servant of God does the work of God, he’s got to
       have the power of God. If Pentecost is wearing a Pentecostal robe, it’s got to have Pentecostal
       power and the God of Pentecost, or it won’t do any good.
       
        And what is it? Everybody ninety percent of the people are sitting around waiting for Brother
       Branham to come back and get on a white horse. HE’LL NEVER DO IT! HE’LL NEVER DO

       ON A WHITE HORSE AND HIS NAME WAS CALLED THE WORD OF GOD. HE’S THE
       LORD!
       Revelation 19:11-16-Reference quote:
       11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called
       Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
       12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name
       written, that no man knew, but he himself.
       13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of
       God.
       14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen,
       white and clean.
       15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he
       shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of
       Almighty God.
       16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND
       LORD OF LORDS.
        My God help the people today. The devil is trying to make idolaters out of people that love
       the prophet of God. DON’T TELL ME THEY’RE NOT BAPTIZING IN HIS NAME.
       THEY’RE PRAYING IN HIS NAME, AND THEY’RE PREACHING THAT HE IS THE

       Question Asked:123. Brother Branham, we know that you are a messenger sent from God to
       this church age. The very same signs that followed Jesus we see following you, and we
       are…understand why some who know you best think you are Messiah. Would you explain the
       difference in your relationship to God and that of Christ’s?
       
       44
       383 Well, I know, brethren, that is true. See, but let’s wait, I got something wrote down on that
       here, just for a minute. See, MANY TIMES IT’S MISUNDERSTOOD. See? But, now, in the
       person sometime…And I want some of you to turn with me to Luke, the 3rd chapter and the 15th
       verse. While you’re doing that, I might be saying to you…When you get it, that it’s Luke 3,
       it’s…might…it’s in…Let me just…I ain’t going to shut the door, ’cause there’s nobody there.
       Let—let me just get this to you, brethren. You have heard it, it’s all around. But let’s let me tell
       you, see, it has to come that way. It’s got to come that way. If it wasn’t that way I would repent of
       my message. 384 LISTEN, BRETHREN, I ADJURE YOU BEFORE CHRIST THAT YOU—
       YOU—YOU HOLD THIS PART OF YOUR PEACE, but if you were spiritual you would
       understand. See? Don’t you know what the very first thing He said down there on the river?
       DON’T YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? “AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS SENT
       FORTH TO FORERUN THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST, YOUR MESSAGE…” IT’S
       THE MESSAGE THAT WILL FORERUN THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST. That’s
       what the Angel of the Lord said. 385 Now, now notice. Now, “As John the Baptist…” Now, all
       of you have heard that. You’ve read it in books, and heard people that standing there hearing It,
       and everything else, when that Angel Itself spoke that message, “As John the Baptist was sent
       forth to forerun the first coming of Christ, you are sent with this Message, will forerun the
       Second Coming of Christ.” Now, “the Message.” 386 Now, if you’ll notice, and I…Little Willie
       out there put my name under that star out there, and that’s the reason I passed it over, you see,
       ’cause I—I don’t think…Now, I’m going to be honest as I can be, I don’t think I’d have anything
       to do with that messenger, see. That’s right. I believe that i am maybe being sent for a part in
       his church, to help build that message up to a place to where it would when this forerunner
       comes, that he will come.
        AND GOD IS GETTING READY TO RAISE UP SOME MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE
       SINNERS SAVED BY GRACE, FILLED WITH THE SAME HOLY GHOST that he was filled
       with! And if they’d worshiped him, they’ll worship you and I too.

       loved thee.

       65-0418M - It Is The Rising Of The Sun
       William Marrion Branham
       87 It’s not s-u-n anymore. It’s the S-o-n d-a-y, the Son day, that that corn of Wheat (God’s first
       One up from the dead) is to be waved over the congregation, that we are His Seed; and that’s the
       first of the Seed of those that slept, waved upon the first day of the week. On Sunday, He raised
       up. Waved good-bye, and ascended up on High, in the presence of the people. 88 Notice, It was
       the first corn of God’s Wheat that had been raised from the dead, God’s first corn of Wheat. By
       God’s quickening Power, God had quickened His life, raised Him up from the dead, and He
       was the Firstfruits of those that slept, the Firstfruit. He was that Sheaf. 89 That’s why they
       had to wave that sheaf, for it was the first one that come to maturity. And it was waved as a
       memorial of thanksgiving to God, believing that the rest of them would come. It was a sign. 90
       And, today, because He was the first Son of God to come to full maturity, to be in God, He was
       plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people. Oh, what a glorious lesson! By the
       quickening Power, the first One! Although, He had—He had been typed; and many times, as
       we’ll see later, that He was typed. But this was really the Firstfruit of them that slept. He was
       waved over the promised Seed that had promise of Life. 91 He was waved at the Day of
       Pentecost, “when there came a sound from Heaven like a waving, mighty rushing wind,” and
       was waved over the people, the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost, waiting for the
       Blessing to come. 92 AND TO BE WAVED AGAIN, WE REALIZE, IN THE LAST DAY,
       ACCORDING TO LUKE 17:30, IN THE SON DAY AGAIN, “IN THE DAY THAT THE S-ON OF MAN WILL BE REVEALED,” OR WAVED AGAIN OVER THE PEOPLE. 93 Now,
       Who is the Son of man? “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
       Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” And if all the teaching
       that we have, and confirmation of the Word of God; by Word of God, by signs, by wonders, we
       see today, that in the Book of—of Luke here, that as we just quoted from, or the—the Luke the
       17th chapter and the 30th verse; and Malachi 4, and the different Scriptures that we are
       acquainted with, that THAT WORD AGAIN IS WAVED OVER THE PEOPLE, THAT THE
       DEAD TRADITIONS OF MAN IS DEAD, AND THE SON OF GOD IS ALIVE AGAIN
       WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT RIGHT AMONG US, AND IS GIVING US
       LIFE. 94 As Christ was the first One to raise, from all the prophets, and so forth; although
       typed in many places, He was the Firstfruits of those that slept. IN THE BRIDE, COMING
       
       47
       OF CHRIST, COMING OUT OF THE CHURCH, THERE’LL HAVE TO BE A SHEAF
       WAVED AGAIN IN THE LAST DAYS. Oh, my! 95 Waving of the sheaf! What was the sheaf?
       The first one that come to mature, the first one that proved it was a wheat, that proved it was a
       sheaf. 96 Hallelujah! I’m sure you see what I’m talking about. It was waved over the people.
       And the first time there will come forth, for the Bride age, for a resurrection out of dark
       denominationalism, will be a Message, that the full maturity of the Word has turned back
       again in Its full Power, and being waved over the people, by the same signs and wonders that
       He did back there. 97 “Because I live, ye live also,” speaking to His Wife. “Because I live, ye
       live also.” What a resurrection that that was! AND WHAT A RESURRECTION THIS IS, TO
       BE QUICKENED FROM THE DEAD, “TO BE MADE ALIVE IN CHRIST JESUS,” BY
       GOD’S QUICKENING POWER. 98 HE WAS WAVED TO THEM. THE WORD, WHICH
       HE WAS, WAS WAVED BACK TO THEM ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, THE WORD
       MADE MANIFEST. NOW, AND AS I SAY, IT’S TO BE WAVED AGAIN IN THE LAST
       DAY.
        Nowhere in the Bible and nowhere on tape does it say that Brother Branham will come back
       in an individual resurrection. Brother if he comes back in an individual resurrection, I’d even
       worship him as the Lord Jesus. That’s how strong, I believe it. What is it? The devil is trying to
       kill the thing that God wants to do for the little Bride.
        Brother William Branham was the friend of the Bridegroom, he wasn’t the Bridegroom, but
       he was the friend of the Bridegroom. Nowhere can you show me in the Bible, nowhere can you
       show me on tape where Brother Branham was the Voice of the Bridegroom. HE WAS THE

       like that.” 94 And I closed my eyes, just let the Bible fall open, put my finger on a Scripture,
       Genesis 24:7. Eliezer, Abraham’s faithful servant, the model servant of the Bible, being sent to
       hunt the bride for Isaac. CHILLS RUN OVER ME. SURE, THAT’S MY…THAT’S RIGHT
       WITH THE REST OF MY MESSAGE, PULLING OUT THE BRIDE. 95 He said, “Sware
       that you’ll not take a bride out of these, but go to my own people.” He said, “What if the woman
       won’t come with me?” 96 Said, “Then you’re free of this oath.” He said, “And the God of
       Heaven will send His Angel before you, to direct you.” He went right straight out and begin
       praying, and he met the beautiful Rebekah that become the bride of Isaac. 97 JUST A
       PERFECT MESSAGE, BACK TO THE WORD, “GO GET THAT BRIDE!” THAT’S A
       DUTY. THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR. THAT’S WHAT I’M TRYING TO DO, IS CALL
       OUT A BRIDE. 98 Remember in California there, that interview of the Bride, preview, I had it
       here. How that Bride come up first, and seen Her go by. Then here come Miss America, Miss
       Asia, and all, oh, the awfulest looking thing! And then the same Bride passed by again. One of
       them got out of step, and I was getting Her back in step; two of them, it was. AND THAT’S

       HIM. It had to be, ’cause, get the—get the elected. 71 What this is for is to get the elected
       people that’s coming out, like in the days of Noah. Like in the days of—of Elijah, the seven
       thousand or seven hundred, or whatever it was, that hadn’t bowed their knee, to call them out.
       JOHN CALLING OUT THE ELECTED, AND GIVE IT OVER TO CHRIST WHEN HE

       BECAUSE,” HE SAID, “I’M JUST A VOICE OF HIM, CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS,

       EVERY CHILD OF GOD, that’s what He died at Calvary for! He died at Calvary so He could
       bring His life back into individuals. The life of a bull or goat couldn’t come back on an
       individual. But the life of Jesus Christ was going to come back and tabernacle Himself in His
       people. And now they are trying to say, “That all the great works of Jesus Christ and all those

       54-1204 - God Perfecting His Church
       William Marrion Branham
       16 Then the next time God was manifested, was in His Son, Christ Jesus. Then He come through
       a virgin birth. Conceived by a virgin, overshadowed by the Holy Spirit. God Himself came
       down into a blood cell and wrapped the Blood around Him. THE BLOOD CELL, THE GERM
       OF LIFE OF GOD HIMSELF, WRAPPED IN THIS BLOOD CELL THAT BROUGHT
       FORTH THE SON, CHRIST JESUS. Now, what He did—does by that, to make you perfect
       and to bring you back into fellowship, He brings you through that Blood cell into Himself. You
       get it? THROUGH THE BLOOD CELL OF THE LORD JESUS THAT INVEILED THE
       LIFE OF JEHOVAH, AND WE, COMING THROUGH THE BLOOD CELL, BECOMES A
       PART OF THAT LIFE. SO, DEITY ITSELF LAYS IN THE MAN THAT’S RECEIVED
       THE HOLY SPIRIT. You are a son. I’m a Branham by birth. And a part of Mr. and Mrs.
       Branham is in me. And if you become a son or a daughter of God, part of Deity lays in you. 17
       See how the devil robs you. Say, “Oh, you can’t do this.” All things are possible to them that
       believe. No matter what it is. YOU ARE A PART OF DEITY, a son or dau… not a servant, a
       son and a daughter. Why, brother, it surpasses all Angels, Archangels and everything else. It
       comes right into the Presence of the Potter Himself. And how are we brought? Through the
       Blood. Amen. THEN YOU COME INTO DEITY. YOU BECOME A PART. YOU’RE
       WELDED IN. Let’s think of God folding around Him now. WE’RE GOING TO ENLARGE
       IT BILLIONS OF TIMES FROM THIS BLOOD CELL. AND THERE GOD, IN THIS
       BLOOD CELL, FOLDED HIMSELF UP, AND WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THIS BLOOD
       CELL, AND COME TO REDEEM MAN TO LIFE. Hallelujah. There, when that Blood cell
       spread out, spread out, and brought the body Christ Jesus, Jehovah Himself was tabernacled
       in Him. That through the bursting of that Blood cell at Calvary might bring sons and
       daughters to Himself, in the Blood cell to the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, into Himself.
       AND WE BECOME A PART OF GOD. Amen. That’s what makes Satan mad. That’s what
       shakes him. When the Church of Jesus Christ only knew who they were, brother… Oh, you say,
       “I know there is nothing impossible with God.” He said there is nothing impossible to you.
       Amen. That changes the subject, doesn’t it? Oh, they says, “There’s nothing impossible to God.”
       He said there is nothing impossible with you. “Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray,
       believe you receive it, and YOU SHALL HAVE IT.” Amen.
        And what we need is people to unify themselves together and purge their souls with prayer
       and fasting AND CRY OUT TO GOD FOR HIM TO POUR OUT HIS SPIRIT. WE CAN
       TAKE THIS MOUNTAIN FOR GOD, IF THE CHILDREN WOULD GET TOGETHER.
       Amen.

        Think about it, how the angels of God…How the angels of God ministered to the apostles,
       even after the great outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Why did they minister to them after the
       outpouring of the Holy Ghost? Why did they? Why? Why? If we’re the Bride of Christ, why
       isn’t the blind seeing? Why isn’t the lame walking? Why isn’t the secrets of the heart made
       manifested? Brother Branham said that if the Word is in you and the power of the Holy Spirit,
       the Seal of God is on you, it’ll do the same thing in you that it does in me. And if it don’t there’s
       something wrong. Why can’t we do the things that God has told us we could do? It’s because the
       devil has got us over here in a corner, blinding us, trying to get us to receive a natural. LET ME
       TELL YOU SOMETHING, DON’T YOU KNOW THAT IT’LL TAKE THE GREATEST
       POWER AND THE GREATEST FAITH TO GO IN THE RAPTURE. IF WE CAN’T WORK

       flash like lightning. And a Church is coming out; not a psychologist, not some of this put-on,

       They come out of there with an inheritance. They come out heirs and joint heirs with Jesus
       Christ. They was setting in the throne with the Lord Jesus. They had the sepulcher of authority;
       
       53
       they had the rod of authority in their hand. Look at them when they came down from out of
       there, each one of them received an inheritance. Now, we don’t all get the same inheritance, but
       we everyone gets the same Holy Ghost. The same God that comes in me comes in you, and then
       we receive our inheritance when the Holy Spirit is poured out like it was on the day of Pentecost.

       37 Now, you see, Jesus had proven to God that He’d been the right kind of Son. And God took
       Him up on the top of the mountain, brought witnesses out there—heavenly witnesses and earthly
       witnesses—and He clothed Him in immortality. When they looked up, they said, “His garments
       shined like the sun.” A supernatural something taken place. His garments glistened like the sun
       in its middle of the day, as white as they could be. God placed on Him that robe of immortality,
       showing that He had received Him. That’s the thing that God will do to His sons here on earth
       someday. He will call you aside, Church, if you’ll only obey Him and stay on the Word and
       believe it. And HE WILL PLACE INTO THE CHURCH, BEFORE THE COMING OF
       JESUS CHRIST… HE WILL PLACE INTO THE CHURCH… ALL THE POWERS THAT
       CHRIST HAD IN HIM WILL BE IN THE CHURCh. All that God was, He poured into
       Jesus; all that Jesus was, He pours into the Church. God wanting His work done, He sent it
       into His Son; the Son wanting the work done, sent it into the Church. “At that day you’ll know
       that I’m in the Father, the Father in Me, and I in you, and you in Me.” At that day, because
       the same power of God, was in Jehovah God, rested in Jesus Christ. THE SAME POWER
       THAT RESTED IN JESUS CHRIST, RESTS IN THE PLACED SONS IN THE BODY OF
       CHRIST. 38 Placing of a son… Take him out in a certain place, have a ceremony before
       Angels, and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ. THEN THAT PERSON
       HAS THE AUTHORITY. Let me say this, if you count me a fanatic from this night on. That very
       same thing that I’m speaking of will be done. THERE’LL BE A POWER PUT INTO THE
       CHURCH, AND NOW IS COMING IN, THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL SO ANOINT THE
       PEOPLE, TILL THEY’LL SPEAK THE WORD AND IT’LL CREATE ITSELF RIGHT
       THERE. WE HAVEN’T SEEN POWERS LIKE’S COMING INTO THE CHURCH NOW. I
       KNOW IT FOR A FACT. “Say unto this mountain be moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but
       believe that what you’ve said shall come to pass, you can have what you have said”: THE
       PLACING OF THE CHURCH IN POSITION, WHERE THE FULNESS OF THE POWER
       OF THE HOLY GHOST COMES INTO THE CHURCH. THEN CRITICS’ MOUTHS WILL
       BE SHUT. IT’LL BE A SHORT TIME. Jesus come right off the mountain, went straight to
       Calvary. Notice, it won’t last long, but it’ll be here.

       And here is the Bride and Christ sitting on His Throne, and His Wife sitting by Him, the
       Church. The twenty and four elders…The hundred and forty-four thousand eunuchs of the
       temple ministering to Him. Where He gets up, His Wife goes with Him. Oh, oh my!
        Now, Azusa Street was the last outpouring we had. Read the history of it. Brother, if that was
       the Seal of God, then I’m blinder then a bat. All they had was the supernatural presence of the
       Lord Jesus. And they stayed in prayer until they finally spoke in tongues, that’s all. And years
       later they began to manifest a few gifts. And what that true manifestation of the true gifts never
       lasted long, because they made a money-making racket out of it.
        But the bride of Christ brother is to receive the real thing! No carnal impersonation there.
        Now noticed here, even the devil quoted the scriptures to Jesus.
       The devil said, “Cast yourself down off the mountain.” “For its written…The Lord said, “The
       angels shall stay in charge of thee: lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone he’ll lift you
       up” Showing you that Angels we’re predesignated ordained to watch over the heirs of Christ.
       Matthew 4:6-7-Reference quote:
       6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give
       his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
       thou dash thy foot against a stone.
       7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
        Now here they come down out of the upper room, watch them. Before that, there’s no
       scripture where we can show that any angels was appearing to Peter, or any of the rest of the
       apostles, or the women either. But immediately when they came out of the upper room,
       everything began to take place.
        Before that… now hold this real careful now… Before Pentecost, the spirit was poured out at
       Pentecost, they were believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. But after Pentecost, Jesus Christ come
       down in them and then they were believing in Jesus Christ. Peter went past the Gate Beautiful
       many times believing on the Lord Jesus and couldn’t help the ole boy at all. But when he come
       by after he received his inheritance… Watch this! He received his inheritance and became an
       heir, became a joint heir with Christ. Sitting in the throne with God in dominion over all power
       of the enemy. Jesus said, “Behold I give you power over all the enemy.”
       
       55
       Luke 10:19-Reference quote:
       19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and OVER ALL THE
       POWER OF THE ENEMY: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
        Do you know any man that can stand upon the earth today and can say, “I take every spirit in
       here under my control?” Any child of God that came out of the upper room and could take any
       spirit under their control. And now, we can’t even take our own spirit under our control, let alone
       take mine. At times, I wish you could take it under control for me, cause it gives me an awful fit.
       How many say, Amen?
        Peter passed by the gate beautiful many times, he never said look on me. He probably kinda
       turned his head and cried and felt ashamed that he couldn’t help the man. But brother after he
       and John received their inheritance on the day of Pentecost… Watch these angels now! He come
       right by there again, the Gate Beautiful the same man that he passed goin to the temple thousands
       and millions of times he’d passed him. For years he passed the ole beggar that set there lame
       from his mother’s womb, but now he’s received something. Before he was believing unto it, but
       now he’s possessed it. Before he was professing but know he’s possessed it. You talk about
       resurrection Power; this is resurrection power. And Peter and John past by Gate Beautiful and
       looked upon that’s same old man… he knew, he knew that he had received something, because
       he looked at the old man, and the old man expected him to give him some money, he said,
       “Silver and gold have I none!” I don’t have any silver and no money but he said, “Such as I
       have.” I received an inheritance up there in the upper room, I’m an heir with Christ now. Now
       I’ve received it. Now he knew it, see. And he said, “Silver and Gold have I none but such as I
       have.” I just received it up in the upper room, now I’m going to give it to you. In name of the
       Lord Jesus Christ rise up and walk.” And the ole boy leaped up, leaped up and begin to praise
       God and tore the city all to pieces.
       Acts 3:1-9-Reference quote:
       1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth
       hour.
       2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate
       of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
       3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
       4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
       5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
       6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of
       Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
       7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ancle
       bones received strength.
       8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and
       leaping, and praising God.
       9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God.
        What was it? I believe the angels that was sent to minister to Peter. Peter’s angel, when he
       passed by the angel just touched his and up out of there he came. That’s what I believe!
       
       56
        Now notice here, they had something to give out to the people, they had something to give to
       the people. Now do you know why we’re not passing the Gate Beautiful today and saying the
       same thing Peter did? Because you know down in your heart, YOU KNOW YOU DON’T
       HAVE IT TO GIVE OUT!
        And yet everybody wants to fight poor ole Brother Bob for trying to go and get something
       real. Let every man do what he wants to. I’m going after something real. I done saw… Well, you
       say, “That was all in Brother Branham.” Well, that don’t satisfy me, honey. What I seen in
       Brother Branham only made me more thirsty to get what he got. I got a deep calling to the deep.
       It satisfied Peter. Sure!
        Look here, and then right after that Peter went into prison. Peter went into prison. What
       happened? When he got into prison, they was gonna cut his head off the next day. Brother he
       was chained to all them soldiers. Chained to all them soldiers with great big chains and locks on
       them. Locks on his feet, had him in big chains and locks and his hands locked to all them big
       soldiers. Soldiers inside sleeping with him and soldiers on the outside, and beside that they had
       many gates. Locked up! They was gonna kill him the next day, but greater what was in Peter,
       was greater than those men lying beside of him. And when he was expecting to be martyred the
       next day, what happened? An angel of the Lord come in the prison at night, come in and touched
       him on the side, said, “Wake up Peter my brother!” And he woke up and looked right into the
       face of his angel. Why, just like Paul said, “Are not these ministering spirits sent forth to minister
       to them that our heirs of Christ.” He was coming…The angel was coming to do his job, and it
       was the angel’s job to set Peter free. What did they do? Brother when that anointing from that
       angel just touched those locks, they all came undone. That angel of the Lord walked up to that
       gate of the jail house and it just open wide. And what did it do? It just let every one of those
       guards just snore away, put them to sleep. They passed Peter right on through all the doors and
       gates and then went out to the great gate. And when he went out to the great gate it just opened
       of its own accord. What was it? All the angel done was just pointed to it, and down come the
       gate.
        And over at John and Mark’s house, brother the bride was a praying and crying. “Oh, God,
       we love Peter. Oh, God, oh God don’t let Peter die! Lord Jesus don’t let Peter die. They we’re
       praying and crying to God for Peter. (I think if a lot of people heard me was in jail, they’d say,
       “Oh, good, crucify him, kill him.”) But they loved Peter so much, they were just praying, “Lord
       turn him free! Lord loose him, don’t let him die, don’t let him die.” Amen! God, I hope we got
       more than we got now to go to battle with.
        And they went over there and passed through that gate and come to John and Mark’s house,
       and knocked on that big door of the property there. And a maid run out there and open the door
       and she seen Peter and she almost fainted. Instead of letting Peter in, it scared her so bad, and she
       ran back in there and said, “I’ve seen Peter’s angel.” Peter went right on ringing the bell. Shows
       you that that little maid knew that Peter had an angel. Or, she perceived or supposed that it was
       Peter’s Angel. Goes to show you right there, that the early apostolic Church had divine
       supernatural angels with them to minister in the ministry.
        Notice here, every child of God that receives that inheritance also receives an angel to
       minister to them. How many would like to have that! “Art they not all these ministering angels,
       are they not sent forth to minister to those that are gonna be heirs of Christ?”

       CAPSTONE TO CAP IT OFF.
        You don’t have to just make believe you got something now. Brother He will tell you what it
       is and give it to you. He’ll give it to you. You won’t have to work up something and try today to
       help the Lord out. So many ministers are sayin, “Well, we’re doing the same thing Peter and
       
       58
       them did!” You are? Where? You are? You have an apostolic church? Where? Does all your sick
       and the cripples come out of the cities to your assembly to be healed? I haven’t seen none come
       here yet. They come cripple in and cripple out, they come sick in and they go sick out. They say,
       “Well, sister so and so, she was healed from her headache and her back.” Children, I don’t mean
       to be like that, but that just makes me sick! You know what, we make the great things of God so
       common just anybody can have them. Brother, I want to tell you the gift of God, the Seal of God
       is the greatest thing you could ever receive in your life. IT’S GOD DISTRIBUTING IT TO
       YOU, for you to distribute it out. Jesus said, “Go ye into all the world and freely you have
       received freely give it out.” Where do you see people that out of their belly is flowing eternal life
       and power, healing the sick, cleansing the lepers, raising the dead and speakin the Word, and
       revealing the secrets of the heart. See, you can’t find it. That’s the resurrection power of Jesus
       Christ. That’s what He resurrected for, brother and sister.
       Matthew 10:8-Reference quote:
       8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely
       give.
        No Sir, we see the angels that was with the early church. We see Paul how he was on the ship
       going to Rome, because God said, “Paul you go to Rome.” And the devil said, “No you won’t,
       I’ll drowned you.” And brother, the devil brought up the big storm brother and scared all the
       boatman to death. And before Paul left, that angel walked up beside him and gave him some
       discernment. Paul said, “Ship master, I perceive that this journey is gonna be bad. We better not
       loose from crete here.” “Oh! who do you think you are” Brother he’d ought to have recognized
       what he was. If it hadn’t been for ole Paul in the ship brother there would’ve been in trouble,
       wouldn’t it? The ole devil wouldn’t of bothered them anyway you know. Oh, the ole devil said,
       I’ll sink him, I’ll see that he don’t go to Rome and preach this gospel. And boy, that ole ship was
       about to go under, and they throwed everything on the ship overboard and unloaded. That’s what
       Brother Bob (Gatlian) said we need to do, we need to unload this ship, get out of this ship
       everything in this ship that we don’t need, and lay aside every weight. They begin to take all the
       weight off the ship. Ole Paul was just as comfortable as can be. Why? Because God said, “Paul
       you’ll be at Rome.” Paul said, “Well, Lord maybe everybody else will die, but I’ll survive and
       I’ll go to Rome.” And about that time, the fifteenth day, Paul down there praying and an angel
       walked up there and said, “Paul!” He said, “Yes!” Said, “Paul you’ll be at Rome like the Lord
       said!” Said, “But the ship only will be lost.” And said, “Paul, I’ll give you all the people that’s
       on the boat too, because you love them.” Paul come up and said. “Thus, Saith The Lord! There
       appeared to me an angel down in the hole of who’s angel I am and whom I serve.”
        There’s Paul many years after Pentecost, when Paul received the Baptism of the Holy Ghost,
       the Seal of God, God down in there. When Ananias come over there to Simon Tanners house. Is
       that right! Paul when he received that Seal of God, he received a divine angel to minister to Paul.
       It watched over Paul. It was the one that kept Paul through all them troubles and trials he went
       through. And there it was the one that told him the boat would be lost, but the people wouldn’t.
       And what happened? Paul went over on the Island, that angel got all of them men up out of there
       and turned all the waves and everything and pushed them all up to shore and every one of them
       was amazed. They knew that ole Paul had something in him brother that was supernatural.
       
       59
        Now people don’t know we got anything supernatural in us! That’s why people treat you evil
       like they do saints. That’s why they talk about you the way they do, that’s why they make fun of
       you, like they do. Do you think they’d make fun of them people at Pentecost? Let me tell you
       something, then hundred and twenty come out of the upper room, Josephus… and the historians
       say that they closed the heavens and it wouldn’t rain, they brought plagues down upon cities,
       they cursed cities. The people thought they had the spirit of the God’s in them. You just think
       about what they had! Did you know they’re gonna do it again?
        Did you know the Bible said when this World Council of Churches persecute from this city to
       that city, shake the dust off your feet from them? I believe the Bride of Christ once again will
       call down plagues and curses upon cities and everything.
        Here’s ole Paul goin upon the island there… and Paul wasn’t lazy, he wasn’t sitting around
       for everybody to wait upon him. But he went out there and what did he do, he gathered up some
       wood and begin to build a fire and all those heathens was watching ole Paul. And one of those
       vipers just dead in a couple of seconds. There’re were deadly snakes there on the island. And
       Paul reached down and put the wood on the fire and a viper grabbed a hold on him, he didn’t pay
       any attention to it shook just shook it off. He didn’t say, “Glory to God I’m bit, cut that out
       Brother Bill cut that out of there. Hurry Brother Bill before I die, hurry Bill!” Bill said, “I ain’t
       got no knife! I ain’t got no knife! Make a x there. Oh, turn the tourniquet a little tighter. You get
       to scared your ole heart is ready to have a heart attack. If the snake don’t kill you, the heart attack
       will. But Paul knew that greater was he that was in him. All that went through Paul’s mind was,
       “And if any deadly thing bite you it won’t harm you.” Paul just took that thing and shook it off.
       He went right on fixin' the fire. All them guys eyes was that big on that island, because they
       knew that them snakes done killed many a man. They said, the water didn’t get vengeance on
       him, but this serpent will.” And all them just waitin for ole Paul to die and he just went right on.
       Oh, they said, “This is a God not a man!” Paul said the same God in me will heal. “If I’m not a
       servant of God, BRING ALL THE SICK HERE.” And brother they went all over the island and
       brought the governor of the island and all the sick and afflicted. And ole Paul just laid his hands
       on them and HEALED THEM EVERYONE! And a revival broke out on that island. Why?
       Because his ministering angel was with ole Paul!
        Think about it! Even on down through the age of the apostles they had those ministering
       angels as long as they had that apostolic doctrine. And as long as them…. Irenaeus and Polycarp
       and all them men that contended for the faith that was once delivered to the saints.
        What is contending for the faith? CONTENDING FOR THE REVELATION OF THE SEAL
       OF GOD THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST! You didn’t even know what to contend for
       until Brother Braham come.
        People tryin… so many of us are trying to hold on to a denominational experience we had
       twenty years ago. Thank God for all that, honey, but come over here, it’s a new day now. You’ll
       never do the job with that over there. Contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints.

       William Marrion Branham
       What is it that caused this misunderstanding? THE ANSWER IS, “EXPERIENCE.” WE
       HAVE GONE BY EXPERIENCE AND NOT THE WORD. AWAY WITH EXPERIENCE AS
       
       60
       YOUR MEASURING LINE. THERE IS ONLY ONE PLUMB LINE, ONLY ONE ROD, AND
       THAT IS THE WORD. Now watch carefully and get this. Peter said, “Repent, and be baptized
       in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
       Ghost.” Paul said, “Have ye received the Holy Ghost SINCE ye believed?” This is the whole of
       our problem right here. People repent of their sins, they get baptized in water, BUT THEY
       DON’T GO ON AND RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. YOU BELIEVE UNTO RECEIVING
       THE SPIRIT. Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the Holy
       Ghost. BUT THE PEOPLE STOP THERE. THEY GO AS FAR AS WATER AND THEN
       STOP. THEY BELIEVE, AND THEN STOP. The Bible does not say that you receive WHEN
       you believe. It is, “Have you received the Holy Ghost SINCE you believed?” The exact and
       literal translation is: “Did ye, having previously believed, receive the Holy Ghost?” THE
       PEOPLE BELIEVE AND THEN STOP. YOU DON’T RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST
       WHEN YOU BELIEVE UNTO HIM, HAVING REPENTED. YOU GO ON AND RECEIVE
       THE HOLY GHOST. Do you see it? That is what is wrong with our fundamentalists. THEY
       HAVE NO POWER FOR THEY STOP SHORT OF PENTECOST. They are like the children
       of Israel who came out of Egypt and stopped short of the Promised Land.
        See them angels there. What did they do? They had them all there in the early church. Now
       we come on down here. All down through them early ages they had the ministration of angels.
       They was the ones that caused the great miracles, great healings and all them great things take
       place, see. Why? They had received an inheritance in Christ. And these angels were to minister
       unto them. Brother and sister, if we… God, if we could only realize who we are, what we are.
       God if we could only realize who we are and what Christ has done for us.
        Remember Brother Branham said, “One day that Bride will realize who she is. Remember on
       the tape, “Is Your Life Worthy of the Gospel?” He said, there’s coming one more world-wide
       shaking. And I believe with all my heart that there are gonna be men and women sitting right
       here that’s gonna realize who they are one day and sparks are gonna fly.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 1 - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       Now remember this. Christ in the True Church is a continuation of the Book of Acts. But the
       Book of Revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it,
       making it lukewarm, formal and powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works (attempted
       destruction of God’s people and the discrediting of God’s Word) right down to the time he is cast
       into the lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get the
       TRUE REVELATION OF THE TRUE CHURCH AND WHAT SHE IS, WHAT SHE
       STANDS FOR AND THAT SHE CAN DO THE GREATER WORKS, SHE WILL BE AN
       INVINCIBLE ARMY. If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of
       the Christian church, and by God’s Spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan
       will be powerless before her. He will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood
       his every effort to gain power over Him in the desert. Yes, Satan hates revelation. But we love
       
       61
       it. With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will
       prevail over them.

       63-0630E - Is Your Life Worthy Of The Gospel?
       William Marrion Branham
       48 America, fifteen years ago, when the great healing revival continued on from pentecost, broke
       out in the nation, and there was a revivals on the capital, Washington, DC. The presidents, vicepresidents, great people, governors; great things taken place, governors and—and men were
       healed. Like, Congressman Upshaw had been a cripple for—for sixty-six years, and they could
       not turn their face and say it wasn’t so. It was right before them, but they turned It down. 49 And,
       tonight, that’s the reason this nation stays. She is doomed. There is no hope for it, at all. She’s
       crossed the line between judgment and mercy. And she’s elected in what she has here, to control
       the nation. And she is rotten, to the core. Her politics is rotten. The morals of this nation is lower
       than anything I can think of. And her religious system is rottener than the morals. She becomes,
       in doing this, she has now joined herself, all these churches, and of the nation, into the
       federation of churches, and has taken the mark of the beast. What a thing! Why? Christ give
       them the opportunity, “Come to My feast,” the feast of pentecost, which means “fifty.” 50
       When the Holy Spirit poured out on Russia, they was called to a feast of pentecost, spiritual
       feast, and they turned It down. England, the Holy Ghost was poured out upon them, and they
       turned It down. America, the Holy Ghost was poured out upon them, and they’ve turned It down.
       51 He bid three times. Three times, He sent out, and they did not listen to the feast. THEN HE
       SENT AGAIN, AND HE SAID, “GO AND COMPEL THOSE PEOPLE TO COME. THE
       TABLE HAS GOT TO BE SET. THE TABLE IS READY. THERE IS STILL ROOM.” And I
       believe, that, maybe, maybe within the next few months, or something, or year, or whatever it
       is, GOD IS GOING TO SEND ANOTHER SHAKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, for there is
       somebody still out there, somewhere, that’s a predestinated Seed, that the Light has to fall on,
       somewhere, somewhere in the world. The nation, itself, is gone.

       But God told me He’d stand with me. That’s His obligation. It’s my obligation to stand here and
       tell the truth. It’s His obligation to stand with me. That’s true. 24 So it’s been through the fiery
       test, friends. Don’t believe but what it has… But thank God we’re still on the victorious side
       today, because we’re in Christ. AND THE HALF AS NEVER YET BEEN TOLD. IT’S IN ITS
       INFANCY YET. WATCH IT WHEN IT COMES OUT IN ITS GREAT SEAL YONDER.
       IT’LL BE A TIME WHEN THIS OLD WORLD’S GOING TO RECEIVE A SHAKING
       LIKES IT’S NEVER HAD BEFORE IN ALL THE DAYS. THE GREAT THINGS LAYS
       
       62
       AHEAD. Just… We can’t make them come to pass, just wait as God shows them.
        All right now we bring it on down...And we know the churches went into the dark ages. Is
       that right? They lost all the true apostolic Revelation that the apostles had. They lost the name of
       Jesus, water baptism, and the oneness of the Godhead, and they implanted all kinds of church
       creeds and dogmas. They got away from the Seal of God. They got away from the true Baptism
       of the Holy Ghost, and when they did that, they got away from their inheritance. And when they
       got away from their inheritance they got away from those angels. They got away from those
       ministration of those angels. What happened? Miracles stopped, healings stopped, the glory of
       God stopped, the joy of God stopped, and true salvation stopped. And yet, God saved people all
       down through there by grace. But they lost the plan of salvation.
        Then we come up right through this hour, we come up through Martin Luther he come up he
       had some truth. He had a truth, but he didn’t have the true. He had a portion of the spirit, and
       then they denominized, organized died. Then God raised up Wesley with a little more truth. He
       had justification truth, sanctification truth, right! And then he died and you know what happen
       there.
        And then we go on down where God poured his spirit out at Azusa Street. And then did you
       know it wasn’t but fifteen days after the spirit of God fell that that one-eyed brother organized.
       What he got; do you think if he got sealed, he would’ve organized God? And there was one man
       God used there to come out of that thing and keep moving. And everywhere the spirit moved,
       man organized it. And that died down in just a few months - it was gone. And then they try to tell
       me that was the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. I don’t believe it! If it did it would have brought
       Jesus Christ to the earth and the rapture would’ve done been gone a long time ago.

       260 Pentecost has done the same. They speak in tongues, and so forth, “That’s all you have to
       do. That’s got it. Come on, join the church.” All right. Get your false baptism, and so forth,
       and go on, “And that’s all you have to do.” See? 261 BUT WHEN CHRIST COMES, HE’S
       COMING FOR A VIRGIN WITH…A CHURCH WITHOUT EVEN ONE SPOT OR ONE
       WRINKLE OF DENOMINATION OR ANY OTHER THING, DOGMAS MIXED WITH IT.
       IT’S GOING TO BE WORD, AND THAT ALONE. 262 Now, oh, man, here we are! Blessed be
       the Lord! Now we come to the Body to be the Bride of Christ, now to be His “flesh of His flesh,
       and bone of His bone.” Now, we’ll hurry up now. “Flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.”
       Why didn’t… 263 Ask you a question. Why didn’t all your rains, back yonder, bring the bride to
       Christ? I want you to answer me that. If…His Coming is overdue. We believe it. (Like it was in
       the days of Noah, longsuffering, He’s getting His Bride ready.) Why didn’t these rains…Why
       didn’t you Pentecostals back yonder, a few years ago, when you started, forty, fifty years ago,
       why didn’t you bring Christ, the Bridegroom, to the bride? Going to let that soak, a minute.
       Why? BECAUSE YOU PREGNATED HER, YOURSELF, WITH YOUR DENOMINATION.
       THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DONE. HE WON’T MARRY A WHORE. He’ll marry a
       virgin. It’s flat, but that’s the Truth. You know It, in a flat way. You don’t have to wonder. I
       
       63
       don’t stumble around about It. Tell you the Truth. WHY DIDN’T IT BRING HER? WHY
       DIDN’T IT BRING CHRIST, BRING CHRIST TO HER? BECAUSE SHE’S NOT FIT. HE
       FOUND HER IN ADULTERY. 264 Exactly the reason children don’t live forever when
       they’re born; Adam found his wife pregnated. 265 That’s the reason Jehovah had to take a
       Gentile Bride; found her pregnated. 266 That’s exactly the way Christ has to get Him a Bride
       now; He’s found the so-called group pregnated. HE’S GOING TO SOW HIS SEED.
       SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET IT, BECAUSE THEY’RE PREDESTINATED TO BE A
       CHURCH AT THE END OF THE ROAD. 267 Like Adam and Jehovah’s, He found them
       pregnated with man-made doctrines of denominations. Like God’s Truth, in Genesis 1, “Every
       seed has brought forth after its kind.” So, when the Spirit fell on her, man had been there to
       her womb, and filled it with denominational seeds of his own thinking, so that’s why she got to
       be the way she is, and Christ could not come to her. Hum! That’s hard, isn’t it?
        And I want to ask you something. What’s the matter with people? Did you know there’s no
       more perfection past the Seal of God, the true Baptism of the Holy Ghost? Did you know there’s
       only three steps into Christ? You believe on Christ by justification, you believe on Christ by
       sanctification, but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of God comes, you’ve come into
       Christ and you believe in Christ and you’ve receive your inheritance and you begin to
       demonstrate it and hand it out.
        Now, if we had all that, will you pray tell me, why we needed Brother Branham to come
       forth? What is restore? Was not Brother Branham to bring restoration? How many say Amen!
       (Amen) Well, if we had it all, what do we need restoring for? Goes to show you that there’s
       somethings wrong, somewhere.

       THIS SEVENTH ANGEL IS ON EARTH AT THE TIME OF THIS COMING. 42 Just as
       John was giving his message, the same time that Messiah come in the days. John knew he
       would see Him, BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO INTRODUCE HIM. 43 And we realize that,
       in the Scriptures, over in Malachi 4, there is to be a one like John, an—an Elijah to whom the
       Word of God can come to. And he is to reveal, by the Holy Spirit, all the mysteries of God, and
       restore the Faith of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers, restore back all these
       mysteries that’s been probed at, through these denominational years. Now, that’s what the
       Word said. I’m just responsible for what It said. See? It’s—It’s written, is right. That’s what It
       is. 44 Now, we see that this Seven-Seal Book, now, is the mystery of redemption. It’s a Book of
       Redemption, from God. 45 Now, all the mysteries, at this time, should be finished at the sounding
       of this messenger. Now, here is the angel on earth; and “ANOTHER” ANGEL, MIGHTY
       MESSENGER, COME DOWN. See, this angel was an earthly angel, messenger; but here
       comes One down from Heaven, a rainbow covenant, see, only Christ it could be.
        But notice here that God said, I will restore, saith the Lord all that that the early church had, I
       will restore it. And brother, I’m not just lookin to go back to what they had on the day of
       Pentecost that true Seal of God, but I’M LOOKIN TO GO BACK CLEAR TO EDEN! I

       MUST THE BODY FOLLOW HIM BACK TO EDEN. Where, the Head of the family, the Man,
       the Bridegroom; the Bride being the Body of the Bridegroom, must follow, the Bride, because
       that’s the Head. And the Head is revealed, and come back with Eternal Life; and the Body
       must follow that, because it is Husband and Wife again. Amen! AND AS LONG AS YOU’RE
       PREGNATED WITH THE SAME WORD, WHICH IS HIS BODY; YOU’VE TOOK HIS
       BODY, BECOME IN HIM, WHEN YOU TOOK THE WORD. Not the creed; the Word! Oh,
       my!
        Let me tell you something, I know of one man that never even had the blood of Jesus Christ.
       He conquered death, just because he walked with the Word Enoch. Enoch so pleased God, by
       keeping his Word, that he went walking one day praising God and walking with the Word, and
       he sat his foot down and it never went on the ground. He could not get that foot to go down on
       the ground. He tried but it hung in the air, put the other one down and it went up a foot, he went
       up another and another and walked all the way home to glory.
       Hebrews 11:5-Reference quote:
       5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God
       had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased Go
        But we are the last time Gentile Bride which come into a never die doctrine. There’ll never be
       a preacher preach over you, if you’re the Bride! They’ll never say ashes to ashes and dust to dust,
       because BROTHER GREATER IS HE THAT’S COMING IN YOU THAN DEATH ITSELF.
       WE’RE GONNA CONQUER DEATH! Hallelujah! Boy! You talking about a powerful Bride,
       there’s comin! No wonder, do you think any sickness could stay in the midst of such a people
       like that? Why, cripple arms will be made straight. No wonder Brother Branham said, the things
       that you see me do now, will only be amateur to what the Lord will do when He comes!

       37 Now, you see, Jesus had proven to God that He’d been the right kind of Son. And God took
       Him up on the top of the mountain, brought witnesses out there—heavenly witnesses and earthly
       witnesses—and He clothed Him in immortality. When they looked up, they said, “His garments
       shined like the sun.” A supernatural something taken place. His garments glistened like the sun
       in its middle of the day, as white as they could be. God placed on Him that robe of immortality,
       showing that He had received Him. THAT’S THE THING THAT GOD WILL DO TO HIS
       SONS HERE ON EARTH SOMEDAY. He will call you aside, Church, if you’ll only obey
       Him and stay on the Word and believe it. And He will place into the Church, before the
       coming of Jesus Christ… He will place into the Church… All the powers that Christ had in
       Him will be in the Church. All that God was, He poured into Jesus; all that Jesus was, He
       pours into the Church. God wanting His work done, He sent it into His Son; the Son wanting
       the work done, sent it into the Church. “At that day you’ll know that I’m in the Father, the
       Father in Me, and I in you, and you in Me.” At that day, because the same power of God, was
       in Jehovah God, rested in Jesus Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ, rests in
       the placed sons in the body of Christ. 38 Placing of a son… Take him out in a certain place,
       have a ceremony before Angels, AND PLACE HIM POSITIONALLY WHAT HE IS IN THE
       BODY OF CHRIST. THEN THAT PERSON HAS THE AUTHORITY. Let me say this, if you
       count me a fanatic from this night on. That very same thing that I’m speaking of will be done.
       THERE’LL BE A POWER PUT INTO THE CHURCH, AND NOW IS COMING IN, THAT
       THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL SO ANOINT THE PEOPLE, TILL THEY’LL SPEAK THE
       WORD AND IT’LL CREATE ITSELF RIGHT THERE. WE HAVEN’T SEEN POWERS
       LIKE’S COMING INTO THE CHURCH NOW. I KNOW IT FOR A FACT. “Say unto this
       mountain be moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that what you’ve said shall come to
       pass, you can have what you have said”: THE PLACING OF THE CHURCH IN POSITION,
       WHERE THE FULNESS OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST COMES INTO THE
       CHURCH. THEN CRITICS’ MOUTHS WILL BE SHUT. IT’LL BE A SHORT TIME. Jesus
       
       67
       come right off the mountain, went straight to Calvary. Notice, it won’t last long, but it’ll be
       here.
        Then why is people praying to bring poor Brother Branham up from the grave. WHO
       WOULD WANT TO PRAY ANYBODY BACK TO THIS PEST HOUSE? WHY DON’T
       THEY LEAVE HIM ALONE IN HIS ROCKING CHAIR AND LET HIM ROCK AWAY AND
       REST AWHILE? You want him to come back and do your job for you? YOU take up YOUR
       CROSS and follow after the Lord Jesus Christ or we’re not worthy to be His disciples.
       Luke 9:23-24-Reference quote:
       23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
       cross daily, and follow me.
       24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the
       same shall save it.

        Trouble is people today; they don’t want to think about God revival. They know the price it’ll
       take. They don’t want to think about getting an outpouring of the Holy Spirit because they know
       they’re gonna have to overcome their self. Like one minister brother said, “When the tent comes,
       I’ll walk through a little room and I’ll walk out this side and I won’t have all these faults.”
       Brother, you better get rid of them before you get there! Paul said, “I DIE DAILY! I bare about
       in my body the sufferings of the Lord Jesus that the life of the Lord Jesus Christ might be made
       manifested in me.”
       2 Corinthians 4:10-12-Reference quote:

       11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus
       might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

       116 And when we can display the Token of the Holy Spirit, shows that we have been accepted
       in Christ, and that is our Token that all that we have need of is already purchased by Him. We
       
       68
       are identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 117 The Blood, Covenant Blood, is not
       recognized without the Token. The Word assures us of the promise. The Token is the sign the
       purchase has been made for us. 118 FULL OBEDIENCE TO THE FULL WORD OF GOD
       ENTITLES US TO THE TOKEN. NO OTHER WAY IS THERE, THAT YOU COULD EVER
       BE ENTITLED TO THE TOKEN, UNTIL YOU FULLY OBEY THE WORD. Not what
       somebody has put into It, and added to It; but what God said about It! 119 When He said, “You
       must be born again.” That don’t mean jump up-and-down at the altar; that don’t mean walk
       back there and shake hands with the pastor; that don’t mean all this foolishness that we’ve seen
       done; it don’t mean putting your name on a church book. IT MEANS DEATH TO YOUR
       FIRST BEING, AND LIFE TO THE SECOND BEING. It means that the Blood has been
       applied, and you’re identified by the Life of Jesus Christ. And if He be the Vine, and we be the
       branches, the Life that’s in the branch is in also from the Vine. It’ll bear the fruit. 120 If that
       first branch come forth, that branch out of that Vine, that wrote a book of Acts behind it; if
       that branch ever puts forth, a Vine puts forth another branch, they’ll write another book of
       Acts behind it, ’cause it’s the same Life. If a one of your grapevines out here brings forth blue
       grapes, if it puts forth another branch, it’ll bring forth blue grapes. 121 And I tell you, today, we
       got so many grafted vines into It, with denominations and creeds and things, and yet any citrus
       fruit grafted in can live, live in that Vine. But it’s bearing the wrong fruit. 122 What we need,
       today, is another baptism of the Holy Spirit, and have the real Power of God that identifies the
       works that Jesus Christ promised for this day, not so much as that day. This day, the promise
       that He made here. That was what He promised there, He would pour out His Spirit. Now He
       has promised it again in the last days, and what He would do.
        Brother, it is a constant dying out, constant striving and crying to overcome. This is the
       overcomer age. The Holy Spirit, the seal of God the Capstone will only be given to overcomers.

       155 Now, let’s take now the 12th verse. Now, this is to the church of—of Philadelphia, in the
       12th verse. Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no
       more out: and I will write upon him my name, name of my God, and the name of the city of my
       God, which is the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from…God: and I will write
       upon him my new name. 156 Watch what the overcomer is promised. See? Now, now Laodicea,
       that’s the last church age. There’s going to be some overcomers in there. Watch here. They,
       remember, each church age, the one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offered.
       Watch up here. Now, here, it’s after they done received all these powers, these new names, and
       everything written, that He promised, and eat the hidden manna, and all down through.
       WATCH THIS LAST CHURCH AGE, REVELATION 3:21. TO HIM THAT
       OVERCOMETH WILL I GRANT TO SIT WITH ME IN MY THRONE, (AMEN), EVEN AS
       I ALSO OVERCOME, AND AM SET DOWN WITH MY FATHER IN HIS THRONE. He
       
       69
       that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. 157 THERE’S A REWARD
       FOR OVERCOMERS. Press on, lily. If it’s in you, lay aside the mud and everything else, and
       press towards the top. Yes, sir. “To sit with Me on My throne.” 158 You know, one time, the
       mother of James and John…We won’t have time to read it. The mother of James and John came
       and asked for this place. You know that? Remember that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.]
       “Lord, let my son set on one side, and my other son set on the other.” There’s a mother’s desire
       for her son. But watch. But, “That place,” Jesus said, “was predestinated.” This position was
       not in existence at that time. Why? Notice. “It will be granted to them who it is meant for.”
       What? The one to set at the right hand, and the other closest to Him, was yet an overcomer. See?
       It was still…He said, “I—I don’t grant this. I can’t grant this, but it will be given after the trial
       comes.” Amen. See? “I can’t give this. But after the trial comes, they’ll set on the right hand
       and on the left. There’s a predestinated seed waiting out yonder for that. It will be given to the
       ones that it’s promised to. It’ll be given there, but the test hasn’t come yet; that, he hasn’t
       overcome yet.” See? 159 The person that was to take this place on one side, and another one to
       take it on the other side, next to Him in the Kingdom, it wasn’t yet given, see, hadn’t been
       overcome. THE TEST HADN’T FELL YET. “IT WILL FALL IN THE FUTURE.” “If we
       suffer for Christ and His Word, we will reign with Him, for He is the Word.” Remember, “If
       we suffer for Him and His Word, we’ll reign with Him, in His Word.” 160 Notice. He, our
       Example, overcome, and then ascended up, after He conquered death, hell, sickness, grave.
       Everything, He conquered. “Then He ascended up, and led captivity captive, give gifts unto
       men.” That was the Old Testament, with the Old Testament saints that had overcome. They
       looked for such a Person, and they died before It got there. But when this Person come, “It
       didn’t prevent them which were asleep.” Amen. Can’t lose, any way. Live or die, what difference
       does it make? “Won’t prevent.” See? They looked for that. 161 Even Job back there, he looked
       for it. He said, “I know my Redeemer liveth, and at the last days He’ll stand upon the earth.”
       There was a just man, a perfect man. He offered sacrifice. He done everything that God told
       him to do. He did it with reverence and respect. He was a prophet. And then Satan come
       around, to tempt him. (Just like he comes to tempt you.) What did he do? HE KEPT
       STANDING THERE.
        Don’t you realize why Jesus walked on the water? Because He came to undo everything
       Adam done. Adam, the perfect Son of God, was over all birds, over the water, over the fishes, he
       was over the camels, over the sheep, over the goats, he was over everything. Why? Because he
       was born correctly. Now don’t you know that if we’re born again that we’re born right then?
       Then if we’re born right, then it takes us back where Adam was.

       Who was the pastors that went to that one that Paul got converted? 58 It wasn’t that. It’s here.
       Those so-called meetings today, and they are great meetings, but it only works on the
       intellectual part of man. A man gets under the spell of a revival, and he says, “Yes, I accept
       Christ,” and he does it intellectually because he’s in a great crowd. He does it because there’s
       
       70
       great ministers before him, but it’s only an intellectual conception. That man can never go on.
       HE’S GOT TO COME FROM HIS MIND, TO HIS HEART, AND BE BORN AGAIN, OR
       HE’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO STAND THE TEST. 59 Intellectual conception is all right, but
       when…Remember, when the eye looks upon it, the devil uses your eye. In the garden of Eden, it
       proved that the devil chose the head of man, to work in, but God chooses his heart. The devil
       shows him, with his eyes, something that he can see, and he says, “Seeing is believing.” 60
       BUT WHEN GOD COMES TO A MAN, HE COMES TO HIS HEART. AND HE LETS HIM
       BELIEVE THINGS BY HIS HEART, THROUGH FAITH, THAT HIS EYES DOES NOT
       SEE. FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, THAT, “THE FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE OF
       THINGS HOPED FOR, THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS NOT SEEN.” 61 God working here;
       Satan working here. So what good does these big schools and seminaries do anyhow? It
       sometimes, not always, but too many times, it pulls from here, up to here; when it ought to be
       taken from here, down to here in the man’s heart. 62 You know, the Scripture says, “As a man

       he’s—he don’t know his ABC’s. Half the apostles didn’t know it, that’s right, but they knowed
       Christ. They never taken heed to Peter and John, knowing that they had been out of some
       seminary. They said, “They taken heed and noticed that they had been with Christ,” when they
       healed the lame man, see, at the gate. They knowed they—they had been with Christ. 240 THE
       NEW BIRTH IS CHRIST, IS A REVELATION. GOD HAS REVEALED TO YOU THIS
       GREAT MYSTERY, AND THAT’S A NEW BIRTH. Now what are you going to do when you

       Branham, but that—that ain’t…” Oh, yes, it is, too. It is the Truth. 242 Did you notice? Paul
       never knew Jesus, physically. Paul never knew Him. The only way that Paul knew Him was by
       a revelation, by a vision. Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Paul only knew
       Jesus by the revelation, just like Peter did. 243 Peter had seen Him in flesh, but he didn’t know
       Him by flesh, ’cause Jesus said so. “Flesh and blood didn’t reveal it to you. Even My Own life
       didn’t reveal it to you. But My Father which is in Heaven has revealed the thing to you,” that
       He is the Word of God, “and upon this rock I’ll build My Church.” Peter didn’t know Him by
       flesh. Man walked, and handled Him, and everything else.

       with the Bible: see if that old temper, and selfishness, ungodliness, love of the world, television,
       and things at night; and leaving the church set empty, and the pews set empty. When, you ought
       to be out there like Jesus, you got His Spirit in you, trying to get everybody in the country to
       come to your church, to receive Christ. AND WE CALL OURSELVES THEN THE BRIDE
       OF CHRIST? OH, WHAT A PITY, FRIEND! 216 The hour has come. “His Bride has made
       Herself ready.” Oh! “Made Herself ready.” She laid aside all of these things. Remember,
       ESTHER WAS CHOSEN, AND THE OTHERS WAS REJECTED. AND ONLY THOSE
       THAT’S BORN AGAIN, THAT’S GOT THE SPIRIT OF GOD, WILL BE THE CHOSEN
       THAT DAY, THAT THE CROWN OF GLORY WILL BE SET UPON HER HEAD. AND
       THE OTHERS WILL BE REJECTED.
        Now, Jesus Christ comes to undo everything that Adam ever done. He come to undo
       everything that Adam ever done. Don’t you see friend, Jesus isn’t coming to die. HE’S
       COMING TO CONQUER NOW! AND GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THAT WAS TOOK
       AWAY FROM ADAM AND PENTECOST TOO. Oh, God help us to see who we are! Oh!
       we’re living in the most tremendous hour that’s ever been. It’s not for Brother Branham, or just
       for me, or just that brother here, or that brother there, that’s for every little child of God that
       comes into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Yes sir! Oh, if we could only realize it friend! The
       devil does not want us to realize it, because he knows brother if we see this Revelation, we’ll go
       after him brother with a sword and just cut him. When we realize who we are and what God’s
       done. See!
        Look at all those angels! Now we see what they had. How many see what they had at
       Pentecost now? (Yes) Now where’s that at today? You can’t find it today! All we got is, well
       brother ‘I’ve got a tape recorder that’s the best I can do. Now, I want to tell you about a man.”
       Well, that’s wonderful! But now that wasn’t what he left the apostles! That wasn’t what he left
       the apostles! “Oh, now I want to tell you about when Jesus took us out there in that boat boy. He
       was out on the mountain praying and we went in the boat and was supposed to meet him on the
       other side. Boy, I want to tell you how he come walking on the water.” That would of never done
       it! That would of never done it!
        As much as I love the tapes and as much as I love the Spoken Word books, that’s not the great
       commission. The great commission would have to read like this, “Now, after Brother Branham
       comes, go ye into all the world and take as many tapes as you can get as many as you can afford
       to get through customs and on the planes. Go ye into all the world with these tapes and then play
       them.” (No! congregation says) And the signs won’t follow the believers anymore because it was
       all in Brother Branham.

        Right up here In Angola, New York is a people up there that don’t believe in preachers. But
       they believe that you don’t have to read the Bible no more. All the Spoken Word books is their
       Bible. You don’t have to pray no more, it was all in Brother Branham.
        And a little brother came down here to give me that doctrine. I said very kindly and sweetly to
       it, I said, “Now Brother, I can see that you come down to help us to see this, that’s nice.” I said
       now, “What you’re saying is that Brother Branham was both Eliezer and Rebecca too?”
        He was Eliezer and Rebecca too. NO! He was Eliezer! He was the friend of the Bridegroom.
       He was the friend of Abraham that went AFTER A BRIDE FOR ISAAC! He wasn’t the Bride
       too!! How many say Amen!! (Amen) But he said, “I SWEAR I’LL GO GET YOU A BRIDE!”
       And Brother Branham said, I SWEAR TO YOU LORD, I’LL GO GET YOU A BRIDE, EVEN
       IF I DON’T HAVE A FRIEND LEFT! How many believe he’s gonna get one! How many wants

       3 And I said, “Surely, there is something in this Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, that
       some character in there that You dealt with, would be on the same basis that would be my
       question. If somebody done something, and—and You got after him about it, then let me turn to
       that place in the Bible. And if somebody, whatever they done, it’ll lean my way. Where I’ve done
       wrong, or something You want me to do, or haven’t done, let me see some character in the Bible
       like that.” 94 AND I CLOSED MY EYES, JUST LET THE BIBLE FALL OPEN, PUT MY
       FINGER ON A SCRIPTURE, GENESIS 24:7. ELIEZER, ABRAHAM’S FAITHFUL
       SERVANT, THE MODEL SERVANT OF THE BIBLE, BEING SENT TO HUNT THE
       BRIDE FOR ISAAC. CHILLS RUN OVER ME. SURE, THAT’S MY…THAT’S RIGHT
       WITH THE REST OF MY MESSAGE, PULLING OUT THE BRIDE. 95 He said, “Sware
       that you’ll not take a bride out of these, but go to my own people.” He said, “What if the woman
       won’t come with me?” 96 Said, “Then you’re free of this oath.” He said, “And the God of
       Heaven will send His Angel before you, to direct you.” He went right straight out and begin
       praying, and he met the beautiful Rebekah that become the bride of Isaac. 97 JUST A
       PERFECT MESSAGE, BACK TO THE WORD, “GO GET THAT BRIDE!” THAT’S A
       
       73
       DUTY. THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR. THAT’S WHAT I’M TRYING TO DO, IS CALL
       OUT A BRIDE. 98 Remember in California there, that interview of the Bride, preview, I had it
       here. How that Bride come up first, and seen Her go by. Then here come Miss America, Miss
       Asia, and all, oh, the awfulest looking thing! And then the same Bride passed by again. One of
       them got out of step, and I was getting Her back in step; two of them, it was. AND THAT’S
       WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, KEEP THAT BRIDE IN STEP, HUNT THAT MAN. 99 I
       said, “God, I’m going back home, renew my vows again, and start out anew.” So that’s what
       we’re planning on doing, THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR.

       READY, THE BRIDE READY FOR THE BRIDEGROOM. THAT WILL BE HIS
       MESSAGE. Now you want to learn ABC’s so you can study algebra later? When these other
       seals on the back is opened they’ll only be revealed to them.
       That’s right. Learn ABC first. What is ABC? “Always Believe Christ,” (not your creed), Christ.

       63 That’s, where, the spiritual builders today. AND THAT’S WHY THE BRIDE BUILDING,
       OF CHRIST, IS NOT READY FOR THE BRIDEGROOM, IS BECAUSE THAT THE
       BUILDERS HAS REJECTED THE CHIEF CORNERSTONE that was laid on the Day of
       Pentecost, which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. See? It’s been odd. People act funny. And
       they—they don’t come into the order of our—of our psychology, of our educational, our
       learning, our creeds. It don’t fit in there. And they kicked It out, because It was too odd, too
       peculiar, too disagreeable with the—the plans that we as men had, ideas of what the Church
       ought to be.

       Oh… Jesus said, just before the coming of the Bridegroom there would be a wise virgin with oil
       in her lamp, and one unwise. And the unwise virgin would wake up one day and find out that she
       didn’t have any oil in her lamp, when it become to the place, “BEHOLD THE BRIDEGROOM
       COMETH.” THAT’S WHAT THE SHOUT IS NOW. “CHRIST IS COMING.
       
       
       
       74
        And he said, the works that he did she’s gonna do them also. Said, in THAT DAY… see, in
       THAT DAY, see! When the prophet of God comes, you’ll know that I’m in the father and the
       father in me and I in you and you in me. You’ll remember back how I spoke up out of Brother
       Branham and said, “Your name is Mary Brown, you’re this, you’re that, thus saith the Lord, your
       healed.” You’ll know in that day when that same God comes in you like that and speaks up out
       of you! How many want to see that day? (Amen) God, grant it real soon!
        Alright notice here! we see how we’re coming down to today. Now I got something good I’m
       gonna say. Now, notice here, we’re coming right up here today. All right now, look back in
       history, you don’t see no, any appearance of angels, you go right on through history.
        Now you come up to a man called William Branham. The presence of God begins to deal
       with a man called William Branham; a little ignoramus nobody.
        And there he was up in a cabin one night crying because he loved the Lord. “Lord they tell
       me this is the devil. God take these things away from me! I love you Lord Jesus, Oh Lord! Oh
       God!” And he begin to cry and all at once he seen a light come in. He thought it was a flashlight.
       Brother what, brother it never opened the door, it just came right through. And just paralyzed
       him scared him to death. He looked at that light there and out comes two bare feet. Those two
       feet come right down there. His heart just a pounding, scared to death. Come down in a gown on,
       and come up to his waist and there stood a man with his hands folded. He said, “Brother Braham,
       I’m sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you things that you need to know. And what
       happened? The angel of the Lord ministered gifts to Brother Branham. Watch here see, are we
       not heirs, are not all these Angels spirits sent to minister to these little heirs of the kingdom? He
       said, Brother Branham I’m sent from the presence of almighty God.” He said, “I’m gonna give
       you two signs.” Said, “Now I’m gonna be with you, Brother Branham, all the time. I’ll never
       leave you; I’ll be with you.” And he said, “There’ll be no sickness be able to stand before you.
       Be no sickness stand before you not even cancer.” And there the angel of Lord talked to Brother
       Branham and immediately it went worldwide. Before that, it stayed right in Jeffersonville,
       (Indiana), just as normal as could be.
        Now, I don’t say this to pick at people, honey, BUT I’M TRYING TO TELL YOU THE
       TRUTH FROM MY HEART. THAT’S WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH THE BRIDE TODAY!
       UNTIL WE GO AND GET WHAT PETER GOT, WE’LL NEVER HAVE THESE GREAT
       GLORIOUS THINGS. We got to go back there and get the same thing that fell on the day of
       Pentecost.
        And they say, Brother Bob Lambert thinks there’s gonna be another Pentecostal message. No.
       No, I mean the same Christ that come in and sealed them. There’s more of the message today,
       more Revelation today. But the same power, and greater power then what fell on the day of
       Pentecost I’m looking for! We got to have it.
        Now notice here how this angel went from Brother Branham. And listened! When Brother
       Branham listened to man and this angel forsook him, he was helpless and powerless for five
       years. And your gonna stay helpless and powerless for another five years until you get the out
       pouring of the Holy Ghost in your life. I’m also speakin of me!
        But what it is? I’m trying to tell you, honestly from my heart, I never have got up here and
       claimed to be a great somebody. I know people have went out of this assembly and said, I was
       this and I was that, but nowhere have I said that to you. How many say, Amen to that? (Amen)
       Have I not tried to get the great Holy Ghost in your life? (Amen) That’s all my life, all my
       thinking, THAT’S ALL MY EVERYTHING! I know I’m misunderstood and everything, but
       
       75
       we’ll never be able to demonstrate the love of the Lord Jesus Christ… That’s why. Brother
       Frank, remember that, that’s why I left the field years ago after the Lord Jesus Christ personally
       appeared to me and I was …my spirit was a razor’s honing edge and I was almost a totally
       insane person. People don’t understand a spiritual man, you’ll never understand me! I don’t
       understand myself. AND IF YOU GET SPIRITUAL LIKE YOU OUGHT TO BE, NOBODY
       WILL UNDERSTAND YOU, EITHER. See! BUT I KNEW THIS HAD TO COME! God told
       me it had to come! I knew Brother Branham…Brother Frank knows that I told him those things,
       and here they’re coming to pass. Not one word has ever failed! This thing, GOD WANTS TO
       GIVE IT TO YOU! And we’ll never these great things… we’ll just stay just as powerless and
       we'll go on with more… And I’ll say this, if God don’t come right soon and do this thing, then
       there’ll be another denomination. I dare say it just like it is! That the people…I’m not saying all
       of us. But following this message is the spirit of organization and denomination, all kinds of cults
       and isms.
        Just like that poor little boy (Brother Rideout) that left here, I loved those people. That bled
       my heart. You know I almost died! Those in my congregation knows I almost died of a heart
       attack. These people sitting here went totally insane. That man was just went insane as can be,
       and said things that you’d have to be a donkey to believe. He was talking about, “little birds with
       helmets on.” It won’t fit in the Word of God nowhere. “Little birds with helmets on appeared to
       him.” He come in here, and contradicted things Brother Branham said. Let me tell you
       something! LET HEAVENS AND EARTH PASS AWAY but what Brother Branham said won’t
       pass away! You can’t make yourself a great prophet like Brother Branham. He went out and said,
       “He was a prophet to the Bride and I was… “Oh God, it just made me sick. I was trying to get
       something real to the people, where we can really demonstrate Jesus Christ. We’ll never be able
       to prove Jesus Christ rose from the dead, by trying to make up something, trying to help God out.
       And then they went out and said, “They had a revival.” Where are they now? They’re lost, gone
       and confused. Didn’t I say right here in this pulpit...? The congregation knows! Then they said
       that, “I persecuted them and run them off.” I did no such thing! They right out lied and done
       everything. Where they at now? Went out and tried to make up something! And oh, it just…
        GOD, WE NEED TO LABOR WORK AND STRIVE AND FAST AND PRAY TO GET A
       REAL GENUINE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY GHOST. Then devil just tears everything
       up! Oh, But I’m so glad that He predestinated a Bride brother that will get a real genuine out
       pouring of the Holy Ghost.
        And then they’ll say, “Well, we had a revival but it was so humble nobody could see it.”
       That’s right! It sure was humble boy!
        Let me tell you something, that every revival: revival signifies a move of God in power in the
       individuals. INDIVIDUALS FILLED WITH THE POWER OF GOD shaking the world. Brother
       Branham said, “If I had ten men filled with the Holy Ghost,” said I’d shake the world with them.
       I’d say, as dead as it is now, if we had two filled with it, we’d shake it! Well, I’d bring it on
       down to one.

       William Marrion Branham
       172 We’re not building an organization. I’m not here this morning to build an organization.
       CHRIST NEVER SENT ME TO BUILD ORGANIZATION. CHRIST SENT ME TO BUILD
       INDIVIDUALS TO THE STATURE OF JESUS CHRIST, THAT THEY MIGHT BE THE
       POWERHOUSE AND THE DWELLING PLACE OF THE SPIRIT, BY HIS WORD. BY HIS
       WORD, see, build up the individual to that place. Not build an organization to a greater
       denomination, but build the individual to sons and daughters of God. That’s the idea. See? Add
       to your faith, virtue; to your virtue, add knowledge. Well, now you’re coming to a place. 173
       Now when they begin to say, “Well, we don’t have to accept that today…” You do have to. It
       must be.
       
        I BELIEVE IF I HAD WHAT PETER HAD, I’D SHAKE IT! THAT’S THE REASON I’M
       STAYING HERE AND WAITING FOR POWER FOR SERVICE! You got to be honest in your
       heart. Jesus said, “Blessed are you when you admit that!” Jesus said, “Blessed are you when you
       hunger and thirst after a real filling.” And he said, “Don’t worry about them people persecuting
       you, because you’re going after that.” SEE, IF PEOPLE JUST REALIZE WHERE THEY’RE
       AT IN THE WORD OF GOD. It said, “FEAR NOT LITTLE FLOCK, IT’S YOUR FATHERS
       GOOD PLEASURE TO GIVE YOU THE GREATEST OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY
       GHOST THE WORLD’S EVER SEEN!” Why, we’ll see it in just a minute
       Luke 8:15-Reference quote:
       15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the
       word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
       Matthew 5:8-Reference quote:
       8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
       Matthew 5:6-Reference quote:
       6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
       
       77
       Matthew 5:11-Reference quote:
       11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of
       evil against you falsely, for my sake.
        But fear not little flock, it’s your father’s good pleasure to give you the greatest out pouring of
       the Holy Ghost that the worlds never seen!
       Luke 12:32-Reference quote:
       32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
        What we need today is people that are honest hearted and scripturally trained to the Promise
       of the hour, that’s willing to wait till Jesus Christ comes and does it, because without Him you
       can do nothing.
       John 15:5-Reference quote:
       5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth
       forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
        Oh, you can go out and imitate, imitate and go out and tell a tale. It’s funny, somebody that
       don’t have the real thing… everything that God does for them is always back behind the barn. “I
       back behind the barn praying, and I seen a great light and an angel come.”
        You know, I thank God what Jesus does, He don’t do it behind the barn! Brother, He does it
       out there where everybody can see it! Hallelujah! Jesus said, does man light a candle and put it
       under a bushel? No, he said, he lights it and put it on top where it can give light! AND
       BROTHER, WHEN JESUS CHRIST LIGHTS UP THIS BRIDE WITH THE SAME POWER
       THAT FELL ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, IT’LL LIGHT UP THE WORLD! Glory to
       God! Jesus said, I’m the light of the world, and a city that sits on hill and cannot be hid. Brother
       He’s gonna sit that New Jerusalem on top of that mountain! He said, “Ye are the light of the
       world.”
       Matthew 5:14-16-Reference quote:
       14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
       15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth
       light unto all that are in the house.
       16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
       Father which is in heaven.
        Now, it’s “The Lord did this out back behind the barn.” God have mercy! If He ain’t great
       enough to do it right here in front of us, he ain’t God! Brother, they put cameras on Brother
       Branham when he done it! They put cameras and everything else and the angel of God was not
       ashamed of Brother Branham but He come and stood right beside of him and let them take His
       picture!
        Then you say, “Oh we had a revival but it was so humble you didn’t see it.” That’s right, and
       you didn’t either! Oh, they say, “Well Brother Bob is looking for something that already passed.
       
       78
       He missed it!” I ain’t missed it! Brother, if I missed it, you missed it! If I missed it you missed it!
       And you ain’t going nowhere!
        Brother we better take inventory in our lives and take inventory and see what’s.... Don’t you
       see God’s carrying this thing, to let every interpretation fall to the ground. YOU ALL HERE
       HAD YOUR INTERPRETATION, AND IT FAILED AND IT FAILED AND IT FAILED AND
       IT’LL CONTINUALLY FAIL, UNTIL GOD IN HIS SOVEREIGN GRACE TELLS THE
       TRUTH! And He pours out the Holy spirit like He promised. Oh, if we could just unify our
       hearts together in Christian love and get every fault, everything under the blood of Jesus Christ,
       and say, “Oh Lord God, do this thing that thou hast promised!” Then we’d see the glory of God,
       we’d see the glory of God.
        Brother Branham’s ministry wouldn’t have made an impact without that angel. But soon as
       that angel come, it struck the world. An angel has appeared to a man name called William
       Branham. Canada said, “come Brother Branham!” Africa said, “Come Brother Branham!” India
       said, “Come Brother Branham! Come, Come, Come five hundred, five hundred thousand, fifteen
       hundred, there’s twenty-five hundred, there’s three thousand, there’s sixteen hundred. Calls all
       night long, fifty, sixty, eighty, ninety calls.
        Why? Is Because an angel had come to a man. Before that, nobody wanted him to come. And
       let me tell you something, you let this little insignificant assembly here that’s persecuted all over
       United States… This is the most talked about assembly and the most lousiest preacher in the
       world here. But as bad as it’s talked about, God’s gonna to do it anyhow! You let God in
       sovereign grace pour out His spirit here, and brother you’d have to sit right in your seat to keep a
       seat for the night service. Why? Is because people are so dry and dead and no spirit moving
       nowhere. When she’s poured out brother… Can you imagine being in the desert for about six
       years seven and had not a bit of water, and all at once right up there about a thousand miles or
       five hundred miles and you hear there’s a great gusher pouring up out of the ground. Shoot you’d
       be sand boy I tell you! You talk about makin traction, how many would go? (Amen) How many
       right now if you heard there was an out pouring of the Holy Ghost like fell on the day of
       Pentecost and people are being filled with the Holy Ghost, angels appearing, arms and legs we’re
       created back on people and the greatest revival that the world has ever seen in Africa. Would you
       go? Let me see your hands? My God, I’d go if I didn’t have no money. I’d find me an old log,
       and I’d pass, Brother Frank. You’d say, “Wait on us, Brother Bob.” I’d say, “Just paddle faster,
       I’m gone!” I’d get there! A man say, “Brother that ole boat is leaking and dry rotted.” I’d go
       anyway, brother! “That motor is smoking its burning oil, it’ll never make it.” “Bless God, I’m
       going anyway, I’m gone!”

       has no…Here is the man or woman, just got a part missing. And that’s complete animal, in

        Why? Because you’re hungering and thirsting for it. Now, if you’re hungering and thirsting,
       Brother is not Jesus Christ gonna fill you?
        What happen? When Brother Branham went to India, what did he do? He went to India in the
       name of the Lord. Do you know any minister in this message can go across to Trinidad or South
       America, to Germany or Africa and say I come in the name of the Lord and if I don’t do the
       works of Jesus Christ run me off of this nation? But if I do, do the works of Jesus Christ, then I
       call you to repent! There’s not a man that can do it! THEN IT SHOWS YOU THAT WE DON’T
       HAVE WHAT THEY HAD ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST! Ya but they say, “Oh you’re
       wrong, but we do!” Your sins is gonna find you out!
        Don’t tell me, men that’s right on tape and preach this message and pastor’s a church and run
       around with women that’s not even their wife and committing adultery claim to be born again
       and filled with the Holy Ghost! And I say in the name of the Lord not a holy scripture, that man
       was never born of the Word of God! If it is, then the dirty devil triumphed over the church of
       Christ! Goes to show you brother that people’s gonna come up in this end-time and find out they
       missed it! Oh, we’d better be honest with ourselves and the Word of God. You claim to have that
       great Seal of God and you don’t demonstrate that, and you see down in your heart there’s
       darkness and you don’t have that perfect love, and you don’t have all them great things the Holy
       Spirit is, then you say you got that, then you make God an unclean thing. And He’ll turn His
       hand and make sure your sins will find you out. That’s what the matter with people around the
       country. Oh, you wait until the Holy Spirit falls, and that church comes into position and those
       things will be brought right out in the open. You’re gonna be surprised to find out what people
       are doing. I say bring it on! If I’m doing something wrong, I want God to call it out, call it out
       bring it out in the open. One thing I’ll do brother, is make it right! It me, it’s my soul involved
       here.

       “There’s nothing wrong with you; you’re perfectly healthy.” Said, “You’re wrong.” I said, “No,
       I’m not.” He said, “Get that prayer card down there and look.” Said, “I got TB, cancer,” I don’t
       know what all he had wrote… I said, “I don’t care what you got on that prayer card,” I said,
       “there’s nothing wrong with you.” He said, “Well, I’ve got it on my prayer card.” 25 I said,
       “That don’t hurt…” I said, “I don’t care what you put on your prayer card, that doesn’t mean a
       thing. (See?) It’s what the Holy Spirit says.” And he said, “Well, it is…” I said, “Well, maybe
       you had faith enough to get healed ’fore you come in the meeting. I…” He said, “And that’s the
       way it is…” And I thought, “What’s going on here?” He looked like he was Christian man.
       Looked around, there I looked over on the wall, like towards this way, and there I seen it, moving
       out. And I turned around to him. Many setting here now was right in the meeting when it
       happened. And I—I said “Why, why would you let the devil put such a thing as that in your
       mind?” I said, “Now, you are a certain church,” I won’t call the name, “that don’t believe. The
       days of miracles is past. And you was at the meeting the other night and told me, and—and said,
       within yourself rather, that this was nothing but a mental telepathy.” And I said, “That man
       setting right yonder in the balcony with the red tie on and the gray suit, you was in his house the
       other night; you was setting at a table had a cloth pulled over it like this, and you made up in
       your mind that you was going to come down here and write that on your prayer card, and come
       in here.” And that man screamed out and said, “That is the living truth,” setting up in the
       platform like that. 26 And I said, “Because that you have said, and put that on your prayer card,
       now you have it.” And he died about six weeks afterwards. See, we’re not playing, church.
       We’re living in the Presence of the Holy Ghost.” Remember Ananias and Sapphira? You
       better be sincere and correct with God before you try that. Remember, “It’s a fearful thing to
       fall into the hands of the living God.” See? There it was. It come right upon him, and the
       diagnosis of the case and everything, showed he had both cancer and TB. He said it, he—and his
       words come to pass. That’s just exactly. He sealed his own doom, just exactly.

       62-0121M - And Thy Seed Shall Possess The Gate Of His Enemy
       William Marrion Branham
       240 But if our heart condemn us not; if we know that we’re walking in the commandments of
       God; we see our lives cleaned up; we see it; every Word that God commanded, we keep It; then
       the gates of every enemy is possessed. “Then ask what you will, it’ll be done for you.” “He
       shall possess the gate of his enemy.” Oh, brother, what a church that would be! 241 When I
       come back again to Phoenix, if the Lord permits me, I hope, when I walk into this tabernacle,
       that these pews will be lined, and every pew in the full Gospel movement in this city will be
       lined with saints of the living God: look like Christian; talk like Christian; act like Christians;
       with the Spirit of God moving among them, where, if one would sin, the Holy Spirit call it out
       right then. 242 It’ll do it. You seen it in the prayer line, as up here on the altar. Where, say,
       “You go back there and make that right with your husband. Go, tell your wife that you was
       out, night before last, with that woman, setting on a certain-certain place.” If It’ll do it here, by
       walking in the Word, listening to that still small Voice, It’ll do it in you. You’re Abraham’s Seed.
       
       81
       Then, no sin. 243 Preacher, wouldn’t you like to see that in your church? Walk in this church,
       and look down along through here, see both men and women, godly, saintly, setting there just
       charged with the power of God. Sin could not walk in. A man walk in and set down, the Spirit
       raise up and say, “John Jones, you come from so-and-so, a city, a certain-certain place. He’s
       here to find healing for his body. See? He did a certain thing at a certain place. He did this, and
       he take…has, take this back, make this right, then God will heal him of that cancer. THUS
       SAITH THE LORD.” My, my! 244 Give me a church, give me ten men, who, really jewels of
       God, the Royal Seed, put them men together, and watch what’ll take place. Give me this little
       houseful of people like that, and I’ll show you a Light that the world will run to it. That’s
       right. That’s what God wants us to be. “You’re a city setting on a hill.” You’re Royal Seed of
       Abraham. “It shall possess the gate of its enemy.” 245 Sickness, there’s a cause for sickness.
       There’s a cause for these things. And God, the Holy Spirit, is here to reveal that thing and tell
       you why you don’t get it. What’s the matter with us? We don’t have to wonder, “Will It do it.”
       It’s already doing it. What do you do? 246 Watch that prophet. He listened not to the rushing
       wind, “Glory to God! Hallelujah!”
        Look here now in closing, in just a few minutes.
        Brother Branham went over to Africa… I had to cut out a lot trying to fit it all.
       When Brother Branham went over to Africa, right! And when he went over to Africa preaching,
       and that angel of the Lord that was with him, twenty-five thousand miracles happen in one night.
       How could twenty-five thousand miracles happen in one night if there wasn’t an angel there
       touching the people. And one man said, “I don’t believe it, I believe that’s mental telepathy how
       he tells people the secrets of the heart.” And this ole man went out there praying saying, “Now
       Lord if this is you, now Lord Jesus if you are with Brother Branham” … and this preacher was
       just getting ready to tear the meeting up, this preacher. “Now Lord if this is you and it had to be
       you doing all these things, now Lord you just show me.” Well, he did! The Angel of God just put
       his hand on his back and burned his shirt. Burned his shirt, boy it scared him. He said, “A hot
       hand hit his back scared him and he jumped up right quick.” And he didn’t know what happen
       and when he went home, there was a burnt imprint of a man’s hand right on his white shirt,
       scorched it and burned it! It like to scared the man tee totally to death. Brother, he run… it made
       a believer out of him. Brother, let me tell you something there’s a lot of Thomas’s around, but
       there’s something on its way that’s gonna make a believer out of a lot of us. And he took that
       shirt up there just a cryin screaming and hollering, and Brother Branham said, “Bring that shirt to
       me!” And he brought the shirt up there and he held it up and said let’s see if this fits my hand!
       Brother that shut every preacher’s mouth.
        Let me tell you something, people can go on and say, “Oh they ain’t gonna get no revival.”
       “You ain’t gonna get no revival up there.” “God ain’t gonna pour out his spirit.” “That brother is
       all deceived.” “You know we all got the Token.” I know you ain’t! One person said… got all
       mad…not audible…. If I can’t just tear you up with the word of God and you sit there humble
       and cry when I tell ya…and you fluff all up whether its me or anybody else shows right there, if
       we’ll be honest, we need it. They said, “Well, I tell you one thing, there ain’t nobody gonna tell
       me I ain’t got that token!” I said, “I just told you!” If you had it you’d do the same works that
       Jesus Christ did.
       
       82
        Brother Branham said, “If the spirit of Beethoven was in you, you’d write music.” “And you
       say you got the token? “Ya” I’d say, “Play me a tune!” Oh well, I got the spirit of Beethoven, but
       you know I don’t like the piano.” I’d say, “Who’s spirit you got?” “John Dillinger.” “Oh, you got
       John Dillinger’s spirit.” I say, “You like guns?” “No, I’m afraid of them.” I say, “Did you ever
       rob a bank?” “Well, no, but I do read comic books.” You ain’t got John Dillinger’s spirit!

       63-1103 - Go, Wake Jesus
       William Marrion Branham
       89 So in the boat that we’re sailing in, let’s wake Jesus in our lives. Listen. I’ve often said. If I
       stood here on the platform and told you that the spirit of John Dillinger lived in me, why, I’d
       have guns and be an outlaw. Sure. If I told you that—that—that Shakespeare lived in me, I’d be a
       poet. If the Shakespeare lived in you, why, you, you’d know how to…You’d be the great
       composer of poets. Is that right? Sure. You could. Poems, you could make up poems, because
       Shakespeare, the—the great writer, would be in you, and you would be Shakespeare. Is that
       right? If Shakespeare lived in you, wouldn’t you be Shakespeare? [Congregation says,
       “Amen.”—Ed.] Certainly, you would be. 190 If Beethoven lived in you, wouldn’t you be a
       composer of songs, the great composer, Beethoven? Say, “Beethoven lives in me.” Then you’ll
       do the works of Beethoven. You’ll write his music, certainly, if it lived in you. You would
       certainly do that, because that the spirit of him lived in you. 191 Then, if Christ lives in me, if
       Christ lives in me, the works of Christ will be done through me. Certainly. If Beethoven lives in
       you, the works of Beethoven will make known. If Christ lived in you, the works of Christ will be
       made known, for He is the same. “Same,” He can’t change. Remember what I said? It’s
       Eternal. He can’t change. He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever.
        I’m making it ridiculous, but that’s what we’re sayin. “Oh, I got the Token, ya I’m filled, I’m
       filled with the Holy spirit.” “Do you do the works of Jesus Christ?” If you can’t even do the
       works of Jesus Christ, then how are you gonna do the greater? We haven’t even been able to do
       the works, let alone the greater.
        You say, “Brother Bob what is the greater works?” How many would like for me to tell you?
       (Amen) The prophet of God said, the greater works of Jesus Christ was, believers with the Holy
       Spirit, Seal of God imparting eternal life to the believers.

       60-0925 - That Day On Calvary
       William Marrion Branham
       129 Now notice. The “greater” works, was to have the Power in the Church, not only to heal
       the sick by prayer, cast out devils by prayer, but to impart Eternal Life to believers. The Holy
       Ghost was coming, and given into the hands of the Church, to impart Life. Oh! That’s what
       Calvary meant. It took stooped, degraded men and women, and lifted them into a place, to be
       sons and daughters of God, to heal the sick and to impart Eternal Life; by giving the Holy
       
       83
       Ghost to obedient believers, men who were once unbelievers, be made believers, and impart
       spiritual, Eternal Life. How much greater is it, to say…130 This sick woman laying here, I can
       pray a prayer of faith and she’ll be healed. That’s a great thing. That’s what He was doing then.
       131 “But,” said, “greater than this shall you do. I’m going to give you Power, not only to raise
       him up for a while, but to give him Eternal Life, which will be Eternal, forever.” Poor, blind,
       wretched people, how do you miss that? Don’t you see what the “greater” thing is? THAT’S
       THE GREATEST THING COULD EVER HAPPEN, WAS TO IMPART ETERNAL LIFE
       TO PEOPLE. WHAT IS ETERNAL LIFE? THE LIFE THAT HE LIVED, THE LIFE THAT
       WAS IN HIM, IMPART THAT TO OTHERs. Can a man do that? A son of God can. 132 Jesus
       said, “Whose soever sins you remit, to them they are remitted; whose soever sin you retain, to
       them they are retained.”

       80 Go right back to Genesis, to the original, what is it? Now the world and nature is groaning,
       crying, everything’s moving. What? For the manifestation of the sons of God, when true sons,
       born sons, filled sons speak and their word is backed. I believe we’re on the border of it right
       now. Yes, sir. Say to this mountain, let it be so. 81 “Brother, I—I desire so-and-so, a certain
       thing done. I’m a believer in Jesus Christ.” 82 “I give it to you in the Name of the Lord Jesus
       Christ.” Amen. There’s a manifestation. 83 “Oh, brother, my crops are burning up out yonder. I
       haven’t had any rain.” 84 “I’ll send you a raining, in the Name of the Lord.” There she’ll come.
       Oh, waiting, groaning, all nature waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God. God
       ordained it at the beginning. He gave man the domain. 85 He gave Jesus Christ, and Jesus
       gave it in His Name, with this assurance, “Ask the Father anything in My Name and I’ll do it.”
       Oh, Brother Palmer! WAITING FOR THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SONS OF GOD,
       THE POSITION, THE CHURCH! 86 As I said, the Book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua,
       and Joshua PLACING THE PEOPLE WHERE THEY BELONG. Now, if they wouldn’t stand
       still, and he put Ephraim here, and over on Manasseh’s land, and this one would come back
       fussing and stewing, how they ever going to get along? When one say, “I’m a Baptist, I’m a
       Methodist, I’m a Pentecostal, I’m Oneness, I’m Twoness, I’m So-and-so.” 87 How you going to
       do it? STAND STILL! GOD IS WANTING TO PLACE HIS CHURCH, THE SONS AND
       DAUGHTERS OF GOD. God, let me live to see it, is my prayer. So close till I can just feel it
       with my hands almost, look like. It’s right there. That’s what I’ve longed to see, waiting for the
       time when walk down the street; there lays a cripple laying there, from his mother’s womb,
       “Silver and gold have I none.” Oh, waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God, hallelujah,
       when God will make Hisself known, when they’ll stop sickness, they’ll stop cancer, they’ll stop
       diseases. 88 You think cancer’s something? The Bible said there’s coming a time when men will
       rot right in their flesh, and the buzzards will eat off of carcasses before they even die. Cancer’s a
       toothache to what’s coming. But, remember, that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to
       touch those who had the Seal of God. That’s what we’re striving for now, to get in and be
       positionally placed into the Kingdom of God before these horrible plagues strike. Oh, how good!
       The dispensation of time, fulness of time, the inheritance. In whom we
       also…obtained…inheritance, being predestinated… 89 How was our inheritance given to us,
       through what? Predestination. Predestination is foreknowledge. How did God know He could
       trust you to be a preacher? His foreknowledge. “Not he that willeth or he that runneth, or
       he…It’s God that sheweth mercy.” That’s right, predestination. HE KNEW WHAT WAS IN
       YOU. HE KNOWED WHAT WAS IN YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN COME ON THE EARTH.
       HE KNOWED WHAT WAS IN YOU BEFORE THERE WAS AN EARTH FOR YOU TO
       COME ON. That’s—that’s Him. That’s the infinite God, the infinite. We’re finite, we can only
       think finite. 90 It’s been so much to me, since that what happened to me. I don’t know. When I
       think there, when I stood there for those few joyful moments, and thought, “There’s no
       tomorrow.” There was no yesterday, there’s no sickness, there’s no sorrow. There’s no little bit
       of happiness, then a whole lot of happiness; it’s all happiness. Oh, my! Oh, when I stood there
       and I said, “What is this?” 91 That Voice said, “This is perfect love, and everything that you
       
       85
       ever loved and everything that ever loved you is here with you now.”
        Poor little people, ministers going out over... I wish I could tell you some of the things that
       Brother Bob (Gatlin) told me, men coming from United States over there had done. It just
       brought Bob… he just sat and cried, bled his heart. Oh, you can’t…A person that’s hungry,
       hungry for God you can’t… What a sin that is to go to a person that’s starving for the Lord Jesus
       and say, “Oh, brother you already got it, why you’re praying in vain, you already got it. Do you
       believe Brother Branham to be a prophet?” Oh yes, brother I believe it. Oh, I believe.” Well, you
       got it then.”
        What you do, just like Jesus said, “Woe unto you hypocrites, you false prophets. You stop up
       that out pouring Holy Ghost by yourself not going into it, and neither will you let the little
       hungry ones go into it.”
       Matthew 23:13-Reference quote:
       13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven
       against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
        Why? Because…Let me tell you something! I believe with all my heart men are trying to
       impart their personality to the people. We’re not…I’m not supposed TO GIVE YOU MY
       SPIRIT, I’M SUPPOSED TO PREACH THE WORD OF GOD so we can get His spirit in you.
       That’s what he did!
        But look a there how the Angel of the Lord touched that preacher’s back and burned his shirt.
       No one doubted that the angel of the Lord was with Brother Branham. And it’s the first time we
       had an appearing, such a mammoth visitation of an Angel of God, since the days of the apostles.
        Notice here, that Brother Branham was helpless until that angel come. He was helpless. Even
       on the film we showed the other night, he said, “Of course, you know that I’m waiting on
       something, I’m waiting on Him. He did not say, I take every spirit in here under my control yet,

       waiting on Him, and if He doesn’t come, I can’t minister. I can do nothing, not a thing. But
       when He’s here He can do all things, and He can do it through me if I can submit myself enough
       to Him. The only thing, it is yielding yourself to the Holy Spirit, just yielding knowing how to
       yield your life to Him. Now, I know that He will grant it, because He has promised He would do
       it. and if He promises anything, His Word is good. That’s why I’ve never feared at any time,
       because He’s always took care of me and He will now. That’s exactly. He’s here. In the Name
       of the Lord Jesus Christ I take every person, every spirit under my control for His glory.
       
        But don’t you see honey what I’m trying to tell ya? First, before you can get this, you have to
       be honest hearted, you got to be pure in heart. If you say that you got something and you don’t,
       you’re just a hypocrite. That’s what it was! What if I’d say, “Now congregation you don’t have
       it, but I got it.” Now, Oh, God curse me! I got to be honest hearted, and how can I ever get it if
       I’m not honest hearted.
        I go to the Lord crying, “God send me here Lord, I love your sheep what can I do Lord?
       GIVE ME SOMETHING THAT I CAN HELP YOUR PEOPLE WITH, something real!” They
       seen something real in Brother Branham, don’t give me anything less, than what he got.
        We got more unbelief more power of the devil since Brother Branham’s gone. False anointed
       ones never come on the scene till the seals were opened. We got…And the spirit was loosed at
       the river Euphrates on the Bride. WE GOT TO HAVE POWER!
        But Brother Branham was helpless without that angel. He said, “You know that I’m waiting
       on something, I’m waiting on Him, that angel.” Then you watch him, and then all at once he’ll
       say, “I take every spirit… He’s here!” He said, “He’s here! I take every spirit here under my
       control.” Why? That was easy to do with an angel standing right there beside of him. How many
       could say that too, if He was standing beside you to?
        Then what happened? That angel…When the subject come up to be prayed for, that angel
       moved right in front of him, and that angel just anointed Brother Branham. He just yielded
       himself. He had the Word in him and the Word spoke out of him and would say, “Your name is
       Mary Brown and you’re suffering with cancer, that’s thus saith the Lord.” And then the Angel
       moved back and Brother Branham would say, “Now I don’t know what He said but that wasn’t
       me, that was my voice, but whatever He said you do that, that’s Him.” He said, “Is that true what
       He told you?” They said, “Yes, of course.” Now, that’s Him, that ain’t me.” Now if that was
       Brother Branham, he would of made a mistake sooner or later.
        Now don’t you see children, that’s the same thing that Peter and Paul had. Don’t you know
       what Jesus said, “When they deliver you up to the Council of Churches and the Synagogue, don’t
       
       87
       meditate what your gonna say.” Said, “That there’ll be a Word given you in that hour” and it’s
       not you that’s speakin, but it’s that Capstone, Token, speakin out of you.
       Matthew 10:19-20-Reference quote:
       19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be
       given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
       20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.
        How many want the real thing? (Amen) All he’s doin… what if it come this morning! All
       He’s doin is waiting somewhere, for honest hearts to get right with God. So, I go on record…
       I’m ain’t no prophet in this hour but just seeing the scriptures… I tell you in the name of the
       Lord… I’ll tell you in the name of the Lord, that it’s gonna happen. Sure! You say, “Would you
       tell all the world?” Brother, if I was on a hook up, I’d broadcast it all over the world and put my
       name under it! Sure, it’s gonna happen, nothing short of it!
        Now watch here real close. See how helpless Brother Branham was without that?
        Now I’m gonna come to something, I hope you go home and just meditate upon it for days. If
       you do, it’ll open up a great thing to you.
        Now I want to read from a “Sir’s is this the Time?” in just a minute. You write this down and
       read it when you get home. Page forty-nine. That’s why I believe the Holy spirit was here so
       wonderful this morning, He wants you to know this. Now watch here Page forty-nine. Now
       listen, I’m gonna talk about ten or fifteen minutes on the third pull. Page forty-nine, “Sir’s is this
       the Time?”

       62-0601 - Taking Sides With Jesus
       William Marrion Branham
       62 There’s three things could happen to me. It’s either the end of my road, and LET THIS
       OTHER ONE COME ON; I’ve opened up the road for him to take over, ’cause,
       REMEMBER, THE ONE THAT COMES TO PREACH, WILL BE ON THE WORD,
       “Restoring the Faith of the children back to the fathers.” It could be the end of my road. It
       could be that He’s changing my ministry back into evangelism, for overseas. Or, it could be that
       He’s not going to call me anymore for an evangelist, and He’s taking me into the wilderness
       somewhere, to anoint me, to send me forth like the promised one is to come, I think. It could be
       any of those things. 63 I cannot go on the way I been going. Because I’m…The people has
       believed me. I—I have to say this. I say it before men. The people, many times, regard me as
       being a prophet. I do not regard myself that. No, sir. I do not. I have…I don’t say that to be
       humble. I say that to be truthful. I do not regard myself to be a prophet of the Lord. I—I haven’t
       that honor. 64 I BELIEVE THAT THE LORD HAS USED ME, IN LITTLE SPECIAL
       THINGS, TO HELP MAYBE LAY A FOUNDATION FOR A PROPHET THAT WILL
       COME. But a prophet doesn’t operate the way I operate. Now, you know that. A prophet isn’t
       an evangelist, and an evangelist isn’t a prophet. A pastor isn’t an evangelist, and an evangelist
       isn’t a pastor. “But God has set in the Church, first apostles, then prophets, then teachers, then
       pastors,” and so forth. God set them in the Church, and God gave them an office. 65 But, the
       morning when I laid that cornerstone! Because, now, if you’re spiritual, you get it. Because of
       the cry of the people! If you could break that out, or take the book and read it, it said, “Do the
       work of an evangelist.” Didn’t call me to be an evangelist, but said, “Do the work of an
       evangelist, for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine, but will heap
       themselves together, teachers, having itching ears, and shall turn from Truth to fables.”
        I believe that other is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bridegroom, the Bridegroom, the Voice of
       the Bridegroom, the turtle dove calling to the beloved Bride. It’s the one you love. You fell in
       love with Him when you seen Him with Brother Branham. But now He promised He’d marry
       you. But now the Bridegroom Himself is coming to marry you. How many understand that? It’s
       all scriptural. I could preach for hours on that.

       Harvest Time #2 7/30/72 Am.
       Robert Lee Lambert
        “But notice, after his ministry, then came another ministry on the scene that did have the
       rainbow over his head, showing you that was the Third Pull, White Eagle, White Horse Rider
       coming to none other than the predestinated rainbow trout to hook them into the body of Christ.
       
       89
        Notice here, the Rainbow Covenant is only to the predestinated Bride of the Bridegroom.
       This Angel with the Rainbow Covenant is Christ the Bridegroom, coming to engage the Bride and
       give her a covenant of marriage. He cries out His message and say’s, Time Is All Over! The space
       of time allotted to the church ages is now over and it’s no more, it’s run out. No more can men
       and women be saved under any denominational creed or dogma. No more will God forgive you of
       your sins and spare your soul in any of them churches. The mercy has left that age!
        No way for anybody to be saved in anyway form or fashion today, outside that they come to the
       ministry and message of that Mighty Angel of Revelation 10:1. He, and he alone, who has that
       ministry to the Bride of Christ, has the authority to enter you into that divine Rainbow Covenant
       of Christ Jesus our Lord.
        Do you realize how great that covenant is? When He enters in with you into that covenant, he
       swears and takes an oath by God Himself. Takes an oath, He swears, to you that if you enter into
       that Covenant with Him, and if you’ll eat His flesh and drink His blood, He swears that He will
       give you the Token!
        And then Anything… when He gives you that Token…Anything that you’ll ask in His name,
       He’ll do it. What so ever you desire, and what so ever, you desire when you pray, He will give it
       to you. Just ask anything in His name, when you get that.
        Just ask anything in His name, and you will get it. Lord, I want my Boy! You got it! Lord, my
       wife. You got it! Lord my wife here, her eyes are gone, her sockets are dropped out! I give her two
       new eyes! My little girl, Lord, she has no legs! I give her new legs! I don’t care…
        (The power of almighty God hits Brother Lambert and takes his breath away)
       Oh God have mercy! I just can’t hardly preach, it’s just so great it’s eating me up! Oh, praise him
       saints!
        Oh, Oh, little Bride, don’t you realize that Bridegroom is speaking to you and telling you
       these things this morning? It’s not your brother, it’s the Voice of the Bridegroom. He loves
       you!! He’s going to give you all the desires of your heart! What so ever you desire, it shall be
       done! He’s entering into a divine, sworn, bloody covenant.
        He died and gave His blood and swore by an oath that He loved you, and that He was coming
       to marry you and give you all that you desire!
        What once saved people underneath those Seven Church Ages, will no longer… Oh, hear me,
       beloved! Whatever you had over in that day, you cannot bring over here in this day, because it
       was only an imitation, it was only a substitute. It was only allotted by the grace of God to you,
       because… God would not hold you responsible for it because there was no way that He could tell
       you about it because the time was not right. The time of redemption had not drawn nigh. But He
       said little eagle lift up your head, for your redemption draws nigh. The hour will come when I will
       draw nigh and I will come down with that mighty Angel, Christ, with that great Rainbow Covenant.
       The hour will come when I’ll come down on Him with that covenant and if you’ll believe what
       He tells you, and if you’ll eat His flesh and drink His blood, I swear that I’ll give you the Token.
       And then, whatever you ask. it’ll be done!”
        Now notice here, it said, “There’s a great ministry laying ahead.” Now we just got to come
       right down to it, it’s kinda sticky to see it that way. I didn’t want to think of it that way either.
       But now we got to face it, Brother Branham’s been gone six years. And if some individual raises
       Brother Branham up… He cannot raise until somebody calls him up. And then we got two
       
       90
       ministries on the scene. And there’s no scripture in the Bible for it. The only thing you can do is
       go out on a limb and interpret a vision that he had. And we can’t do that, and be scriptural. Just
       prove it three months, three years, six years. And remember, I can say for sure, you don’t have to
       call Jeffersonville to see if he has come up from the grave. I’ll tell you that he hasn’t. they say
       he’s comin up… see that just hurts the Bride, hurts the church. It’s all over Pennsylvania and
       everywhere that he’s gonna raise up and anoint Joseph Branham. Let me tell you something,
       Joseph Branham is a sinner, and unless he repents, that boy will perish. That boy…I don’t
       believe he’ll perish. But I believe Joseph will repent and get saved. The boy is not saved, he’s a
       sinner. And people tryin to follow a little boy that’s ain’t saved. Goes to show you what a
       wretched condition we’re in.
        Now there’s a great ministry layin ahead, right? That’s got to be the ministry of the
       Bridegroom. How many believe that? Alright now let’s watch here, I’ll prove it to you right here
       in the Word. See, I’m gonna tie it in with these Angels.
        I quote Brother Branham;
        “Watch the third pull, let’s stop on that a minute. In the vision, the first flight was little
       messenger birds, that was when we first started, it grew from” … Watch that now! It grew, in
       more power. It grew from just taking the person by the hand and do you remember what He told
       me, if you would be sincere it will come to pass that you will know the very secrets of their
       heart. How many remembers that here and across the nation? Did it happen exactly? He told
       Brother Branham not to fear, I will be with you, it shall go on, get greater. Now the first pull was
       little bitty birds, little bitty birds; them flights. They went on to meet the time, to meet the
       coming of the Lord. Are you listening? They went on to meet the time, of the coming of the
       Lord, the first message. The second time, it is the secrets of the heart. From taking a person by
       the hand, and just standing there and saying what they had. The next time, it revealed their sins
       and told them what to do and make it right. Then that came to pass, perfectly: just as God said it.
       And when I said, I saw an angel” and then he goes on… I’ll skip that. “Notice, the first little
       flight; in the hand. The second was greater, white, doves;” Watch that! Holy Spirit revealing the
       secrets of the heart. And the Third Pull, the third flight was angels (not birds). angels. And that is
       the end time, that is all of it.”

       398 If this is the Third Pull, then there is a great ministry lying ahead. I don’t know. I can’t
       say. I—I don’t know. 399 Watch. Third Pull, let’s stop on that, a minute. In the vision, the first
       flight was little messenger birds; that was when we first started. It growed, from just taking a
       person by the hand. 400 And you remember what He told me? “If you’ll be sincere, it’ll come to
       pass that you know the very secret of their heart.” How many remembers that announced from
       here, and across the nations? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] And did it happen?
       [“Amen.”] Exactly. Then said, “Don’t fear. I’ll be with you.” See? And it shall go on. 401 Now,
       the First Pull was little, bitty birds; them flights. They went on to meet the time, meet the Coming
       of the Lord; the first Message. 402 The Second time, the secrets of the heart. From taking a
       person by the hand, and just standing there and saying what they had; the next time, it revealed
       
       91
       their sins and told them what to do. And ma-…Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.]
       Then, that come to pass, perfectly, just as God said it. And you are witnesses, and so is the
       world, so is the church. 403 When I said, “I saw an Angel, and It was an emerald Fire,
       burning,” people laughed and said, “Billy, get next to yourself.” The magic scientific eye of the
       camera took It. I wasn’t lying. I was telling the Truth: God vindicate. 404 I said, “Darkness
       overshadows; it’s death, black. And This is white. One is Life, the other one is death.” And there
       It is, on the picture back there. At the… 405 As George J. Lacy—Lacy said, “The mechanical eye
       of this camera won’t take psychology.” Are you following me? [Congregations says, “Amen.”—
       Ed.] 406 Notice, the first little flight; hand. The second was greater, whiter, doves; Holy Spirit
       revealing the secrets of the heart. And the third flight was Angels (not birds), Angels; and that’s
       the end time, that’s all of it. Will this be the time, brother? Is this the time?
       
        Now watch here, now notice the sign in the hand, went out to meet the unbelief of the devil in
       that hour, and it overcome it, Right? Now notice the second flight was doves. What was the
       dove? It was getting more like the Lord Jesus, dove, the Holy Spirit. Now notice, that the first
       flight went out to meet the opposition of the hour, went out to meet challenge of the hour, the
       devil. Right? You understand that, don’t you? But it was going on meeting the challenge of the
       devil until the coming of the Lord. That was meeting the devil, until the coming of the Lord.
       Now the coming of the Lord… now.

       He sent a prophet, anointed with a Pillar of Fire, and HE CALLED THE PEOPLE OUT.
       THAT WAS HIS FIRST EXODUS. 263 AND WHEN ISRAEL’S TIME WAS UP, HE SENT
       AGAIN, A GOD-PROPHET, with a Pillar of Fire. JOHN SAW IT DESCENDING FROM

       28 Notice. Then when John saw Jesus coming, just an ordinary man, not any different in stature
       perhaps than the average man. He walked right through the crowds and nobody knowed Him,
       went right through the pool of Bethesda and all around. Sometimes they’d get to fussing with
       Him, the Pharisees; He’d just walk right out of the crowd. And they couldn’t tell Him from
       anybody else; they all wore beards and robes; so they all looked alike, no different. BUT JOHN,
       WHEN HE WAS STANDING PREACHING, BEING THE FORERUNNER… As a little
       
       92
       history of it, maybe true, maybe not, I can’t say. But said he was preaching on that day about
       eleven o’clock and debating with the priest across the river. Anyhow, we know he was at the
       river baptizing. And he turned and looked, and here come Jesus walking down the hill, coming to
       the bank of the Jordan. AND WHEN JOHN LOOKED, QUICKLY HE KNEW HIM. HE
       SAID, “BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD, THAT TAKE AWAY THE SINS OF THE
       WORLD.” DO YOU GET IT? “BEHOLD” MEANS “TO LOOK UP TO.” “BEHOLD THE
       LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD.” Over in the book of
       John he said, “I knew Him not (He was like any other man.), but He that told me in the
       wilderness to go baptize with water, said upon WHOM THOU SHALL SEE THE SPIRIT
       DESCENDING AND REMAINING ON, THE SAME SHALL BAPTIZE WITH THE HOLY
       GHOST AND FIRE.” Amen. 29 Get it? “Upon whom thou shall see,” revelation. John. Didn’t
       say the audience. John bare record, seeing the Spirit of God. John was anointed; JOHN WAS
       GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE HIM. JOHN WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT
       KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. For it was given to John alone. And HE BARE RECORD,
       SAID, “I SAW THE SPIRIT OF GOD DESCENDING LIKE A DOVE. AND IT WENT
       UPON HIM, AND A VOICE SPEAKING FROM THIS DOVE, SAYING, ‘THIS IS MY
       BELOVED SON, IN WHOM I’M WELL PLEASED; HEAR YE HIM.’” OH, MY, THERE
       YOU ARE: SPIRITUAL REVEALED TRUTH. Nobody else saw it. Or the Scripture doesn’t
       declare it if they did. But John bare record. It was revealed to John, as it was revealed to Abel,
       as it was revealed to Peter, as it is revealed to every believer here tonight. Something that you
       can’t, you can’t explain it. John couldn’t go on all the diagnosis, and say, “This is the way it
       was, and this is the way it was.” He said, “I saw the Spirit of God. That settles it. And God told
       me in the wilderness upon Whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining, the
       same is He that’ll baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire, so I know it’s Him.” Amen. That it
       settles it.
       
        God help you see that! He comes from heaven first with a Shout, and then the Bridegroom
       comes himself as the Voice. That’s the coming of the Lord, the Voice! But that isn’t the rapture,
       the rapture! The rapture is the trumpet when the dead in Christ shall rise. There’s a ministry of
       the Voice of the Archangel. Where does the Voice of the Bridegroom come from? Comes

       19 Now, I have had many things to happen in my life, but I never had anything like that. I went
       into a trance. I don’t know the interpretation. I’ve never had anything like it in my life. But,
       before me, it seemingly that I realized that it was a vision, and I was in the vision. But I was
       talking to my son, Joseph. Which, he was not in the room at the time. But somehow, just as it
       struck me, I was talking to Joseph. 20 And I—I looked up. And kind of in the shape of a pyramid,
       standing before me, was little, small birds, something like a half-inch long. And they were, up at
       the top, on the limbs, there was a…may say, three or four. Then, next, next limb had maybe eight
       or ten. And down at the bottom, had fifteen or twenty. 21 And they were little warriors, because
       their feathers was beaten, and looked like they were trying to talk to me, saying something. And
       I was in the West, seemingly around Tucson, Arizona. And the birds were looking East. And I
       was listening close. Was trying to say, looked like they were trying to tell me something. And
       they had little feathers, was all been beat up, and things. They were pretty well battle-scarred.
       Then, all of a sudden, one bird begin to take the other one’s place, jumping like that. And they,
       the little birds swiftly left, FLYING EASTWARD. 22 And when they did, from that came a
       larger bird, more like doves, with a pointed wings. And—and—and they come in a swarm, and
       swiftly, more swift than what the little birds was, flew eastward. 23 And I still in my…the two
       consciences together, I knowed I was standing here, and I knowed I was somewhere else. See?
       And I thought, “Now, this is vision, and I must learn what this means.” 24 And no more than the
       second group of birds come by, I looked to the West. And looked like in the form of a pyramid,
       like two on each side, with one in the top, came five of the mightiest Angels I ever seen in my
       life. Such a terrific speed, I never seen. Their heads back, and Their pointed wings, just sailing
       quickly! And the power of Almighty God struck me, in such a way, till It lifted me plumb from
       the ground, all the way from the ground, up. I could hear Joseph still speaking. 25 And sound
       like the sound barrier breaking, that—that a great roar went off, way in the distance, to the
       South. And when I was lifted up…And there was such a terrific speed of the Angels! And I—I
       can just see Them right now, see, as—as They were coming, in that shape like that, just sweeping
       right into me. 26 Now, not dreaming, now. No. I was right there, wide awake as I am now. See?
       27 But here It come. And They were so terrifically fast, till I thought, when It lifted up…I heard
       that explosion, like, or like a blast that went out, like a sound barrier. And when it did, I thought,
       “Well, this must mean that I’m fixing to be killed, see, in a blast of some sort.” And—and I
       just…While I thought on those things, I thought, “No, it wouldn’t be that. Because, if it was a
       blast, it would have got Joseph, too. Cause, there he is, still talking, thinking I’m there. I can
       hear him. It wasn’t that.” 28 Now, this is all still in the vision. It wasn’t…See? It was in the
       vision. 29 And then, all at once, as I realized that I had been…They were around me. I couldn’t
       see Them, but I had been brought into this constellation of a pyramid of Them, inside this
       constellation of—of Angels, of five. And I thought, “Now, death Angel would will be one. Five
       would be grace.” I was thinking that. I thought, “Oh! It’s—It’s coming with my Message.
       That’s my second climax. They’re coming to bring me the Message from the Lord.” And I
       screamed out with all my might, as loud as I could, “O Jesus, what would You have me do?”
       And when I did, It just—just went away from me. 30 I—I—I haven’t felt just right, since. See? I
       was, all day yesterday, I had to stay in the house, almost feeling beside myself. I can’t make my
       
       95
       mind get clear. And the glory and power of the Lord! I was numb all over, when It left me. I was
       trying to rub my hands. And I thought, “I can’t catch my breath.” And I walked around, and
       through the floor, and back and forth. I thought, “What does it mean, Lord? What does it
       mean?” Then, I stopped. I said, “Lord God, Your servant is…I—I just cannot understand. Why?
       What was that? Make it known, Lord.” Well, when the… 31 I can’t tell you about, when I say,
       “Power of the Lord.” There’s no way to explain that. It isn’t what you feel here, in the blessings.
       That’s the blessings of the Lord. This is a sacred! Oh, my! It’s—it’s beyond anything that a
       mortal could even imagine. See? And it—and it was bothering me, real bad. It don’t…It isn’t a
       blessing. It’s a bother. You’re troubled. See? That it is. If you could only… 32 If I could only get
       some way that I could tell the people what that was, or what it…what the feeling of it was! It, it
       isn’t just like sitting here, want to rejoice. It’s—it’s something that every nerve in you just…It’s
       beyond scare. It’s beyond frightened. It’s a holy reverence. Of…I…There’s no way to explain it.
       Even, till, my entire back, up-and-down my spine, through my fingers, up-and-down on my feet
       and toes, my whole being was just numbed, see, just like you had—you had went out of the world,
       somewhere. And—and it was leaving me, gradually, and I said to the—to the Lord, “Will You
       just let me know, O God?” 33 I guess, that, the closest that ever come of being that strong again,
       was when I was in Zurich, Switzerland, that time when He show me that German Eagle watching
       that English horse-rider come down through Africa. And He said, “All have sinned and come
       short of the glory.” 34 And I was crying out to the Lord, to help me. And I—I want Him to give
       me the interpretation, because I wondered if it meant—if it meant that I was going to go away, I
       was going to be killed. And if it was, I wasn’t going to say nothing to the family about it. It’s my
       time to go Home, why, I’ll just go Home, that’s all of it. But if—if that’s what it meant, I didn’t
       want to tell the family, didn’t want them to know nothing about it. Just let it be done, and that—
       that would be all of it. 35 I said, “Lord, help me. I don’t want to tell the family, if—if
       You’re…This, it’s my call Home, well, I’ll—I’ll be going.” You see. I said…And, you know,
       you’re… 36 You say, “Well, why didn’t you think about what you said in the vision, what the
       vision said?” 37 But you can’t think of things like that then. You…I can’t, anyhow. And I
       thought…I was just troubled, upset. You don’t know how to think. You can’t think. 38 And I said,
       “Heavenly Father, if that meant that—that an explosion was going to take me, well, let me know
       now, so I’ll say nothing about it. Let Your glory and power come upon me again, and lift me up
       again. Or, let Your glory come upon me, and then I’ll—I’ll know then that it meant—it meant
       that, and so I can keep it to myself.” And nothing happened. 39 So then I said, “Then, Lord, if it
       meant that You’re going to send Your Messengers for my commission, then let Thy power come
       again.” It like took me out of the room! 40 Though, I—I’ve come to myself, with my Bible in my
       hand, then, see, and asking God to help me. And when I did, He—He showed me something in
       the Scripture, pertained right to it, right there. And I thought, “Could that actually be that? How
       did I do that?” And, oh, I—I can’t explain these things, folks. It’s beyond anything I know about.
       See? 41 My wife is a very odd woman; one of the best in the world. But, a little while, I didn’t
       say nothing about it. I went ahead. She knew there was something happened. So when I told her,
       she said, “You know, Bill, I see you and hear you, in many of those things.” Said, “You know I
       believe you with all my heart,” she said. She said, “But that really had something.” 42 It just
       seemingly, just shakes me, that blasting and that swift coming of those Angels like that, five of
       them together, in a—a constellation of Them. Like, kind of like—like I had that pyramid drawed
       here, see. They looked to be, at first, They looked like, kind of a…in the distance, They looked
       kind of like that color of doves. And they were in—in coming from this way. And they were, look
       
       96
       like, one, two; three, four; and then one right at the top, see, making five. And they come with
       such a speed! There is nothing, no jets, no nothing else can compare with that. 43 And I can
       just see Them, and Their heads kind of turned side-ways. Those wings tipped back, fullarmored, and here They come, so “Whew!” Like that. Just come right down, and just took me
       right into this pyramid of the constellation of Them. I seen I was off, up off the ground. I
       thought maybe…I heard, way in the distance, that roar, “Whoom!” Like a—a—a plane when it
       crosses the sound barrier, you’ve heard it happen like that, just like a distant roar. 44 I thought,
       “This may mean now, when now this vision leaves me, that I’m going to be killed by an explosion
       or something.” I thought, “Here I am. I’m lifted up. I’m…They, They’re here somewhere. I’m—
       I’m in this, this pyramid of Angels here. But, I—I don’t know. Maybe the Lord is coming to take
       me Home.” Then I heard Joseph down there, saying, “Daddy?” Thought, “No, if that’s it, it
       would have took him, too.” 45 Then Something said, “You…” REMEMBER, I’M WAITING,
       WATCHING FOR A MESSAGE THAT I ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO,
       SOMETHING. 46 And the vision, the other day, you know, as I had here not long ago, telling
       me about what was going to happen; how I was preaching in, from the sun, into this place.
       And—and then He said, “NOW REMEMBER, THE SECOND CLIMAX IS YET TO COME.”
       I THOUGHT, “THERE WILL BE A MESSAGE.” 47 Remember my Message here? THE
       OPENING OF THAT CAPSTONE, WHERE, THOSE SEVEN VOICES AND SEALS
       THAT’S NOT EVEN WROTE IN THE WORD OF GOD. Remember? And it took me into that
       pyramid.
        Now hold this! The Kingdom of Heaven has been coming from the negative to the positive all
       the time. Now the Kingdom of Heaven is the Capstone. The true baptism the true Seal of God is
       the Kingdom of Heaven. Christ in you is the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus said, if I cast out devils
       by the finger of God, then the Kingdom of Heaven is come near you. Is that right? The Kingdom

        Now notice here, they beat down the little birds, beat them down. God raised up a greater
       ministry by a dove. Now do you notice that the doves was discerning the secrets of the heart
       which was the Second Pull?
        See, that’s why I couldn’t believe that poor little brother (Brother Rideout) that said here,
       seven birds appeared to him. See, he thought them birds flew back eastward coming to him. See,
       I…Now how many…how could I go on with God and believe that? See! God don’t go
       backwards and do something backwards. God don’t go backwards. He goes forward. How would
       he bring back the little birds when they were beat down and had to leave? The devil beat them
       down, their feathers was beat out. How many say, Amen to that! Amen!

       211 I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and started praying. I heard
       a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, “What are you leaning against, over your
       heart?” And I raised back like this, my bare shoulders; naked from my waist up, hot. I looked
       back. And there was wrote in the quartz, in the stone, “WHITE EAGLE”; JUST EXACTLY
       WHAT THE VISION SAID THAT THE NEXT MESSAGE WOULD COME FORTH BY. 212
       I was so excited, I run home; got a camera and come back the next day, and took the picture of
       it. It was still there, wrote in the rock: “White Eagle.” (DOVE LEADING EAGLE.)
        And he had to raise up something greater to meet the power of the devil. And he raised up
       them great beautiful white doves. But remember, the seventh dove never came. How many say
       amen! Now notice, what happened? Brother Branham at the close of his ministry in 1965 said,
       that little dove fell into camp with its wing blown off. Come on! If its wing was blown off, and it
       was shot through but the message got through!! Showing you that the power of the devil beat
       that ministry to death! Beat it to death! But Jesus said, not by might, not by power, but by my
       Spirit saith the Lord! I’ll raise up a standard against that devil! They beat him to death. The devil
       beat him to death. But brother what happened? Brother, the Third Pull is not little birds with their
       feathers beat out, it’s not little doves fallen into camp with their wings blown off and shot
       through, BUT IT’S THE MIGHTY ANGELS FROM HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH!! GLORY TO

       205 And the next day Something said, “Go back to the mountain.” 206 And that day instead of
       going one way, I was led to go another way. And I was standing there; and looking, setting in the
       front of me, and THERE SET THAT SEVENTH LITTLE, WHITE DOVE, looking right at me.
       I rubbed my eyes, I said, “Surely, it’s a vision; surely, it is.” I looked, and I said, “Little dove,
       where do you come from?” Just as pretty and white, could’ve been a pigeon; whatever it was,
       away in that wilderness. 207 God Almighty, Who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, Whose
       servant I am, and His Word laying here, open before me, know that I tell the truth and lie not.
       208 There set the dove, setting there looking at me. I walked around, I thought, “Surely, it’s a
       vision.” I turned my head, I looked back, and there he set there; them little, white wings, just as
       snowy as he could be; his little, yellow feet; and little, yellow beak; setting there looking at me.
       He was watching right straight westward. I walked around him like that, I wouldn’t touch him
       for nothing. I walked on up the trail; looked back, and there he still set watching me. 209
       Brother, as a son of Abraham, I consider not what the doctor told me, I’m going to be well,
       anyhow! 210 The third day I went back, I was climbing up high. And many of you know the
       vision about the Indian chief riding that little wall to the west. Something attracted me off to a
       big rock, about noontime, said, “Lay your hands against that and pray.” God in Heaven
       knows this is true. 211 I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and
       started praying. I heard a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, “What are you

       113 Now, I want you to watch. They said that “He went to the land of Nod.” Now, Cain was in
       Eden. And Eden, the garden of Eden, laid east of Eden. Is that right? The garden of Eden was
       east in Eden, the east side of Eden. And the Cherubims was placed, AND THE TREE OF
       LIFE WAS AT THE EAST GATE OF THE GARDEN, and there’s where I think Cain and
       Abel made their sacrifice. And there’s where the Cherubim WITH THE FLAMING SWORD
       wouldn’t let them come in anymore, EAST OF THE GATE! 114 DID YOU NOTICE, JESUS
       WILL COME FROM THE EAST. THE LIGHT RISES FROM THE EAST. EVERYTHING
       COMING…Civilization started in the east and traveling west, until it revolves around and
       catches itself again. We are the Western Hemisphere. That’s the Eastern, the Eastern is the
       oldest civilization. China’s the oldest civilization known of, by historians, in the world today.

       guards the eastern gate. AND CHRIST IS “THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDA.” HE
       SHALL DESCEND FROM THE EASTERN SKIES, ENTER IN BY THE WAY OF THE
       GATE. HE COMES FROM THE EASTERN GATE FROM THE TRIBE OF JUDA. AND

       42 Listen, God bless you. I want to tell you just one thing. I know I’m holding long, but I just
       want this one little thing. I know, and I want you to remember. There’s something fixing to
       happen. Remember, I told you that. There’s a step up coming in the Church now. See? These
       things that you’re now seeing, are going to be just little things after while. Something’s a
       moving. And I say this by the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ, whom I… Every one in
       our doctrine, in our baptism, we’ve come to a place, BUT THERE’S SOME KEY THAT’LL
       UNLOCK SOMETHING HERE. NOW, HE SAW THE BOOK SEALED ON SEVEN SEALS.
       AND WHEN THE… DANIEL SAW THE SAME, AND WHEN THE THUNDERS
       
       102
       UTTERED THEIR VOICES HE SAID, “DON’T WRITE,” WHAT THAT WAS IN THE
       SCRIPTURE, BUT IT’D BE REVEALED IN THE LAST DAYS. WE’RE AT THE TIME.
       We’re at Kadesh right now. 43 Here a few nights ago, I went into Brother Vibbert’s, over from—
       over at Paducah, Kentucky, crossed over into Evansville. Oh, Brother Bosworth was with me.
       And I said, that day I said… It just kept burning on my heart a message, that I knowed that
       something God had promised on the opening up of the power, yet I’m waiting now for Him,
       which I believe will appear to me visibly. I say it with reverence; I’ve seen Him twice. ’Course it
       was vision. He was standing in the air. One night I stood, and I even broke a straw off the field,
       put it in my mouth and chewed it. Looked again, I said, “Surely this is not vision.” I stood there
       in the broom sedge a looking. I’d been praying all night. AND I LOOKED AGAIN; I
       SEEN HIM WITH HIS FOOT LIKE THAT AND HIS HANDS FOLDED, LOOKING
       TOWARDS THE EAST. 44 And I walked around this way and cleared my throat. And when He
       looked around at me, raised out His arms, I fainted and didn’t come to till the next morning. And
       I have an idea what He looks like. And I’ve been feeling for the last few months that I’ll see Him
       again. Here in… pretty soon that He will reveal again His… something that’s fixing to come
       forth. Oh, brother, if I have it right, God forgive me if I’m wrong, but seeing it in the Scripture,
       seeing that WHEN HE ROSE AND ASCENDED UP, HE RECEIVED A NEW
       MAN… NAME THAT NO ONE KNOWED ABOUT. THEN I SEE HIM COMING IN HIS
       POWER. I went over, and I said, “Don’t no one bother me today. Let me stay alone.”
        The devil, the unbelief, beat the little birds to death. Can I give you one more thing? Well,
       let’s just tell the devil… let’s just stay here all day. How many just like me to preach all day?
       That’ll get the pressure of the devil away from me. All right now, I got all day!
        All right now watch here, Even in 1937 flood in Jeffersonville… Now there’s nobody that
       loves the Branham Tabernacle more than I do, but I just tell the truth. A lot of times I get up and
       confess things about myself that I don’t like, but I go up and confess it anyway. It hurts, sure it
       hurts, I’ve made restitution for things that bled my heart to do it, but I did it. I had to do it to go
       on with God. The truth’s the truth!
        Now what happen in the 1937 (Ohio River) flood? (in Jeffersonville, Indiana) When Brother
       Branham said, there’s gonna be twenty some, thirty some feet of water over Spring Street, or
       whatever it was. They said, even Brother Branham’s congregation made fun of him and laughed
       at him. And what happened? He rowed over to the Branham Tabernacle in a boat and when the
       water resided and he come into the tabernacle and the pulpit went to the ceiling and come back
       down and the scripture was open to Genesis 6, Noah and the flood.
        Hold this! I feel something there. Hold this now. The Bible, the flood… when the flood
       resided and the Bible come down on the pulpit and it was opened to Noah and the flood, Genesis
       6. But the pews come down cross one another. Showing you that the Revelation that was in the
       Word of God was perfect. But the congregation was in confusion. And the piece out of the Bible,
       was to the Branham Tabernacle, not to the world. For the time will come when the Branham
       Tabernacle people would not endure sound doctrine on the teaching on the Seal of God the
       Capstone. And God said to Brother Branham, I’ll send you west. And when he looked it turned
       into darkness and Brother Branham seen a vision where John the Baptist had been baptizing and
       they had turned it into a hog lot and the hogs were eating their own after afterbirth.

       62-0908 - Present Stage Of My Ministry
       William Marrion Branham
       2 And now this is to the many peoples and friends of mine around the world. I wish to state
       tonight, here in the tabernacle…If you, any of you were present and could see, they’re real warm
       in the tabernacle tonight. People are packed in and all around, stand indoors, and outside in
       their cars and things, and it’s very hot, and it’d be difficult for the people and for myself also. 3
       But I have come to this place that I want to explain what stage of time we’re living in according
       to the ministry that the Lord give me. And I wanted to record it from the tabernacle. It came on
       my heart last spring, but I waited till I got back here so I could get a—a recording of it, to send it
       to you peoples of the world. 4 It’s been about thirty-two years ago, that when the Lord Jesus,
       within a hundred and fifty yards of where I’m present standing now, here in Jeffersonville at
       Eighth and Penn Street, the morning when I laid the cornerstone on this tabernacle, just being
       then merely a swamp. And I lived just across the way to my left here. It was before I was
       married. I was living with my father and mother. That the Lord Jesus woke me up the morning
       that the cornerstone was to be laid, about early, about six o’clock. And I had been lying in bed
       for some time, with my heart full of joy, thinking of this great time that the Lord God was going
       to give me a tabernacle to preach in. I was merely a young boy then. And that day I…the girl that
       I was going with, which was soon to be my wife the following year, was to be with us the day we
       was to lay the cornerstone. 5 And I remember that morning when I had wakened up, and
       laying in the room, the upstairs right here on Seventh Street. Something said, “Rise up to your
       feet.” And I got up. And I saw, as it was, a great place, and it was like a—a—a place where
       they would…a river run in the valley. And I got down there to the river and I understood it
       was a place where John the Baptist had been baptizing the people, and they had turned it into
       a hog lot. And I was very critical of it, just saying that it should not be done. 6 And while I was
       there, there was a—a Voice spoke to me and took me up, and I noticed this tabernacle in just
       about the state it’s in right now. But there were so many people till they were just packed all in,
       in the tabernacle, in this condition, about the state it’s at now. And I—I was happy, standing
       behind the pulpit, saying, “God, how good You are to give me a tabernacle.” 7 And, at that time,
       the Angel of the Lord spake to me, and said, “But this is not your tabernacle.” And I said,
       “Then, Lord, where is my tabernacle?”
       
        Do you think I believe that God would move in the tabernacle in Jeffersonville this morning?
       Impossible! He can only move where there’s righteousness and holiness and unity and love. God
       ‘s no respecter of person. How many say, Amen to that? No sir!
        What did they do? They beat down the little birds. And what did Brother Branham preach
       there in Shreveport? Remember that great message he preached on the wings of a snow-white
       dove and how he cried. And that little dove he was talking about was him. The seventh dove was
       the seventh messenger angel. Showing you that it wouldn’t be there for a long time, but in the
       end-time he saw the dove. Showing you, he come into the ministry of Elijah. What did they do?
       They beat the birds down, beat the feathers out of him and tore him all to pieces and finally the
       little dove broke into camp, but it brought the message. It was shot through and broken up, but it
       brought the message. Right?
       
       104
        But what happened, the Third Pull was not little birds and not doves, but mighty Angels. Let
       me say this, THERE’S NO DEVIL GONNA BEAT THEM DOWN. THEY’RE COMING TO
       CONQUER. HALLELUJAH!
        Alright now, watch here, but I’m gonna quote some things. I didn’t get my (Nugget) Book,
       but I’m just taking my time. I’ll quote them the best I can. Your posted, you know it’s so.
        Brother Branham said, on the message, The Spoken Word is the Original Seed. He said, I
       believe my ministry is to forerun the coming Word.

       Now the seals opening in 1963 WAS TO LOOSE A MINISTRY OF THE FULL-BODIED
       WORD. That's why the fullness of power will come into the fullness of His body Word. It is to
       LOOSE A MINISTRY OF THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH, THE FULL WORD OF
       GOD.
       The last sign in the zodiac is Leo the Lion and Leo is Word -- prophetic Word. We are living in
       the days of prophets. That is the only way that God can reveal Himself, is through the prophetic
       Word of God, the prophetic anointing of God.

        Now can Jesus come with just part of the word? (No) He’s got to be the full body Word. Now
       how can Jesus be the full body word until the seals we’re opened? Now what does God do to
       raise a standard against the enemy? He raises the standard against the devil and his demons and
       unbelief, by the Revealed Word of God and by Angels to back the Word of God up with. Right!

       262 Notice, the very day when this messenger…Not when he starts on, but when he begins to
       declare his Message. See? The First Pull, healing; Second Pull, prophesying; Third Pull, the
       opening of the Word, the mysteries revealed. No more, there is no more higher order to reveal
       the Word, than prophets. But the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the Word. And,
       remember, the Third Pull was the opening of them Seven Seals, to reveal the hidden Truth that’s
       been sealed in the Word. Do you see it?
       
       
        Now I got something real good that the Lord give me I never seen before, it’s just wonderful
       to see how the scriptures… One brother said, boy I believe the day comin the word gonna come
       to life. Honey, the Bible, has been revealed for several years now, and people don’t know it.
       That’s right!
        You say, well why isn’t it goin worldwide? Search the Bible and see. It happened one place in
       Jerusalem, didn’t it? Now God will not move where everybody thinks they got it figured out.
       God will move some place where nobody knows about it. And He’ll move with a little
       ignoramus bunch that nobody knows about. He’s always done it and always do it.
        Now here’s what I believe. I believe that those third pull Angels is the coming of the
       ministering angels, which is the Kingdom of Heaven, the Capstone, the Seal of God. Is, coming
       ministering angels are coming to the believers that are gonna receive their inheritance and be
       heirs of Christ.
        Now remember… where we just come down through here now. Now watch here! Real
       quickly now. I’ll go over the vision of Paradox. (Brother’s Branham’s) Listen to the tape
       “Paradox” when you get home and see if I’m not tellin you the truth. Remember Brother
       Branham had the vision on Paradox. I’ll speak as quick as I can and get it out.
        Brother Branham said he had a vision about three am this morning. I thought he was walking
       on the map of Palestine coming down to the Jordan. He says, as I come down to the Jordan, I
       heard a little sweet voice, singing, like a sister from the Klap Tabernacle. Oh, I want to see Jesus
       or something like that. He said, I was coming down through there walking on the map of
       Palestine and come to the river Jordan. And he said, when I got to the river Jorden I looked back
       and I had come two thirds of the way, the first and the second pull. One more third to go, right?
       That’s the First Pull and the Second Pull, two thirds of the way, one more third to go right! And
       that was the Third Pull. And he looked back he said, I come two thirds of the way and I have one
       more third of the way to go. And he said, that one third of the way will put us over across the
       Jordan in the promise land, where all the great, great promises of God lays across the Jordan.
       
       107
       And he said when I ended up on that narrow highway, I noticed when I entered upon the narrow
       highway that people were real scared and the people were afraid. That’s the hour were living in
       right now, scared, spooky, afraid. You don’t know who’s the truth, who’s this, who’s the
       anointed one who this…you know. An what is everybody scared of?
        And the Voice of an angel said, it’s troublesome times Brother Branham, fearful times.
       Brother Branham said to the Voice, what’s fearful? He said, there’s a hideous snake here, and its
       bite is deadly. Brother Branham said, about that time I looked and this snake came upon the
       narrow highway and took after a little brother. And that little brother was jumping and trying to
       get out of the way of the snake. And I fell to my knees and said, Oh Lord, if that snake bites him
       it’ll kill him. He said, it was a mamba snake and its bite is deadly, and your dead in two seconds.
        And a Voice spoke out of heaven and said, Brother Branham you’ve been given power to
       bind that devil, but you’ll have to be more sincere than you are now.
        Hold that!
        Brother after all he fasted, prayed and he cried, and passed around the world six or seven
       times, and after all the great things he done for God, giving his body as a living sacrifice, and the
       Lord said you ain’t sincere enough?
        Where does that put you this morning, and some who claim to have it all He said, Lord God
       forgive me for my insincerity and give me sincerity. And Brother Branham said that a great
       power came down over him. He said, when I looked at that mamba snake, as it was running
       toward me. He said, I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ. Blue smoke poured out of the snake
       and it made circles like a pitcher handle. Right! Now he said, you’ve been given power to unbind
       that snake, he said, that I might know, I unbind you serpent in the name of Jesus Christ. And the
       serpent came back to a snake again. True?
        Now notice that Brother Branham went to prayer and fasting after that to purge his soul, to be
       more sincere. He said, he always wanted power to bind that unbelief.
        Oh, children, God help you to see what I’m talking about see. It’s not me! That’s the
       Revelation of God for this hour. It’s not my interpretation, it’s what God said.
        Now notice here, two thirds of the way the First Pull and the Second Pull only took the church
       up to crossing in to the promise land, the holy spirit.
        Did not the devil beat down the First Pull and the Second Pull?
        All right now, the Third pull was to take us over into the Promise Land. Right? Now who was
       it that took the church from Moses? God said, now Moses you gone far enough, Joshua the holy
       spirit will take over now. The Holy Spirit took Joshua and Caleb, a new generation, a new
       generation. Watch out you believers that claim, “I’ve followed Brother Branham for fifteen
       years.” Yes, and your carcass may die in the tribulation too. Joshua, the Holy Spirit, took a new
       generation over into the Promise Land. Right?
        Now notice here, that this Mamba snake was the most deadly of all the snakes of unbelief!
       And it was up on the narrow highway. What narrow highway? Narrow is the way that leadeth to
       the Token- Seal of God and few there be that find it. Why? Because that snakes up there. Notice
       the snake come out of the weeds and slipped upon the highway and took after the believers.
       Snake means unbelief, right?
        But God said that you’ve been given power to bind that unbelief. Now he bound that unbelief,
       and then he loosed it. Notice where did the deadly snake enter the picture at? The First Pull? At
       the Second Pull? No! But when the Third Pull comes? Why? Is because the devil don’t want this
       Bride entering into that great revival of the Holy Ghost. He knows if they ever get the Seal of
       
       108
       God with that Word that’s in them, that them people will destroy him. So where does the devil
       send his biggest snake, his most powerful demon, devils, up on that narrow highway at the Third
       Pull? Brother Branham said the false anointed ones could not have come till the seals we’re
       open. What is it? People falsely anointed trying to tell you that there’s no revival for you, you
       already got it, just sit down and wait till the rapture takes place. And get ripe by an infraray
       television sets and you’ll be alright. How many say amen!
        But notice the Third Pull bound the devil, and Brother Branham said, the angels Voice said,
       the third pull was the Revealed Word, the Sword of the King.
        What does God destroy the serpent with is the Revealed Word of God. Right?
        Now notice that the Third Pull was to place the believers over into their Promise Land where
       they could take all the great grapes of the promises. Every promise that God promised in his
       Bible, is laying in that true Seal of God, that baptism of the Holy Ghost!
        And the reason why we’re not eating those promises this morning is because we’re not in that
       Promise Land yet. But we’re in the most dangerous period of all ages. We’re right up there
       where we’re getting ready to cross over the river and the snake, the devils are trying to keep us
       from going over. Do you believe?
        Notice the Third Pull is the Revealed Word by the Holy Spirit taking the believers over into
       the Promise Land where all the ministering angels are getting ready to minister. Like Joshua,
       said, I’ll take that mountain, right! That’s mine! Caleb said, I’ll take this mountain over here.
       One of the other brothers said, I’ll take this fertile valley over here. Another said, I want that
       piece over there by that stream of water. Another said, I want this piece of land over here where
       all these banana trees and orange trees. Every one of them that went into the promise land got
       their inheritance, now if you’ll be honest in your heart this morning before the Lord Jesus Christ,
       you know that Jesus Christ has never appeared to you and give you your inheritance. Truly from
       your heart you can’t say maybe, you really don’t know your position in Christ! But it has to be
       given to you by the Holy Ghost and then you demonstrate that. You say, look at my land here
       this is my promise, this is my banana tree, this is my orange tree, this is my stream here. This is
       mine! And everybody comes on your land and partakes of everything you got. Right?
        Now the Third pull, the Revealed Word of God takes you over and distributes your
       inheritance to you. Now here is where, the ministering angels come in. The Third Pull is angels,
       and those angels are to minister to the heirs that receive their inheritance from the Seal of God
       the Holy Spirit.
        Now watch this here, it’s the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. Now did I not read to you
       from the Spoken Word Book, The Seed is not Heir with the Shuck? It said, that this was the
       challenge of the hour - for us to repent and come into the kingdom and this is where those angels
       are at, in the Kingdom of Heaven.
        Now notice here, the angel of the Lord, the Voice, spoke to Brother Branham. In his heart, I
       always wanted the power to loose and bind.
        Children, don’t you realize honey, can’t you see by the scriptures and by a Revelation that is
       the authority of apostolic church coming back. Did not Jesus say to Peter, blessed art thou Simon
       Peter, flesh and blood has not revealed to you this but my father which is in heaven and because
       you got this Revelation on the Word of God, I give unto you the keys to the kingdom? And
       whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose on earth
       shall be loosed in heaven. DON’T YOU SEE THAT’S THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH COMING
       
       109
       BACK? THE THIRD PULL IS THE APOSTOLIC POWER coming to the church of Jesus
       Christ. How many believe that?
        God, don’t you realize that this morning he may open the gates to the Promise Land. What if
       he would? I don’t know. Six years have gone by, nine years have gone by since the seals we’re
       open.
        Look here, the Third Pull, Brother Branham said, is coming forth a greater ministry, a greater
       anointing, It’s the full body Revealed Word. It’s the coming of Christ, the coming of the
       Bridegroom, the Voice of God.
        Notice that Brother Branham… now the angels come. The Third Pull was angels, right? Now
       notice here that the angels instructed Brother Branham to come back to the Branham Tabernacle,
       and that they we’re gonna loose the mysteries of the Bible, to tell the people how to enter into the
       Promise Land. What was it? It was the King coming after His subjects. He’s got a kingdom, but
       he’s got to have subjects to come into His kingdom. And what is a kingdom? It is people who
       rule and reign in that domain.
        GOD HELP US to see what God called us for in this hour! We’re not called to sit around and
       listen to me preach another year! YOU’RE TO RULE AND REIGN WITH CHRIST AND
       DESTROY THE DEVIL AND ALL THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL! Sure, you are! God, this
       church needs to raise up and go after the promise. Go after your inheritance. Don’t be willing to
       sit around like this forever, see. I’m speakin to me, too!
        Now notice this here that Brother Branham said, when preaching at the tabernacle on the seals
       he said, in this building right now are angels descending and ascending. Everybody looked
       around, couldn’t see nothing.
        I want to quote from Page 50 in, Sirs is This the Time? Brother Branham said, will these
       angels loose a great Revelation that will give the church, rapturing faith who has been slopping
       around, just slopping around and can’t understand rapturing faith? That was 1963. Brother
       Branham said the people we’re slopping around and didn’t understand nothing he was talking
       about. That’s a pretty tough rebuke, ain’t it brother?

       62-1230E - Is This The Sign Of The End, Sir?
       William Marrion Branham
       406 Notice, the first little flight; hand. The second was greater, whiter, doves; Holy Spirit
       revealing the secrets of the heart. And the third flight was Angels (not birds), Angels; and that’s
       the end time, that’s all of it. Will this be the time, brother? Is this the time? 407 Now listen real
       close, and don’t misinterpret this. I want to ask you something. 408 Let’s go back just a minute.
       The church knows it’s the truth. The scientific world knows it’s the truth. And people are sitting
       in here, tonight, and many still living, that were standing here on the river when that Voice
       spoke that out, and said, “As John was sent forth with a message of the first coming, so is this
       the second Message, of the second Coming.” Remember? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.]
       409 And if It’s finished, what did John do? John was the one who said, “Behold, there’s the
       Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. That’s Him.” Is the hour, has it arrived, my
       brethren? I don’t say it has. I don’t know. But, I’m asking you. I want you to think. Or, will this
       be the time when it will be again, “Behold the Lamb of God”? 410 Or, the time of Malachi 4,
       
       110
       “To return the hearts of the children back to the Faith of our fathers”? Will it be such a blast
       that will—that will do such mighty things, until it will set the Church, that’s been sloping and
       cannot understand the mysteries of God, and so forth? When they see that mighty blast sweep
       forth, will it turn their hearts back to the Father, as the Bible said it would do? Or, was this the
       Message, already past, that should have done it? I don’t know. 411 This is the sign of the end
       time, sirs. Or, is this the sign that it’s over? It looks very Scriptural, to me. I don’t know. There
       was them Angels. There was a blast, like a thunder, that shook the whole earth. God knows I tell
       the truth. 412 Just remember, something is fixing to happen. I don’t know what it is. But could
       it be this? The reason I say this, prepare yourselves! Let us pray, (pray how?) take our position
       in the army of His believers, and prepare ourselves, for it may be later than we’re thinking. 413
       You know me, and I have never told you a lie, yet, as I know of. And as Samuel said to them,
       “Have I ever told you anything, in the Name of the Lord, but what come to pass?” Now, I’m
       telling you now. I don’t know what this is. I can’t say what this is. I don’t know. But, I’m going to
       tell you Truth. I’m scared. As your brother, I been scared since last Saturday. 414 It may be the
       end time. It may be time for the rainbows to sweep across the sky, and an announcement from
       the heavens, saying, “Time is no more.” If it is, let’s prepare ourselves, friends, to meet our
       God. There’s been plenty of Food laid in now. Let’s make use of It. Let’s make use of It now. And
       with me, from this platform, I cry to God, “Lord Jesus, be merciful to me!” I’ve tried to live the
       best I knowed how. I’ve tried to bring the Messages the best way that I could, from the Word of
       God. God knows my heart. 415 But, when that constellation of Angels swept that ground, I was
       paralyzed. I couldn’t even feel, for a long time. Even felt like, a long time later, trying to walk
       through the room, even from my spinal cord, and up-and-down my neck, was perfectly paralyzed,
       like, and no feelings. I couldn’t feel, in my hands. I was in a daze, all day long. I—I just went in
       the room and sat down. 416 Sunday, I come down here to speak, and I—I tried to s
        All right! Let’s see if I missed something here. I don’t want to miss nothing.
        Now notice here, the gates of hell cannot prevail against this Third Pull, the Revealed Word,
       which is to take you into your Promise Land where ministering angels will be ministering to you.
       Brother, to me this is the greatest thing, to think my little heart could see this! You say, “Is it
       really gonna happen that way, Brother Bob?” If the Bible is the Bible and Jesus Christ rose from
       the dead, it’s gonna be that way.
        Now, if you’ll just give me a few minutes and let’s turn to Genesis 28. And I think I got
       something wonderful here. It just blessed my soul so good! Now just find Genesis 28 and hold it
       there.
        Now watch here, when you find it I want you to look up here at me. I want to talk to you a
       little bit about Jacob. Now, we know that Jacob was the man who was after the birthright. And
       our birthright is our inheritance, right? And the angels of God are to minister to the heirs. Right!
       Now, I’m going to tie it together here. Now Jacob is a type of the Bride today, see. Jacob is the
       type of the believer today.
        We’re a shyster in ourselves, we ain’t no good. But the one thing that’s good about us that
       God loves, and that is that we are hungering and thirsting after Him, we’re after His promise.
       And Esau was a better man than Jacob and daddy loved Esau better than Jacob. Right? But Jacob
       was hanging around his mama trying to figure out some way that he could get that Token, that
       
       111
       Seal of God. He didn’t have time to hunt or nothing. All he wanted brother… he didn’t care
       about a fishing pole, hunting with a bow and arrow, or nothing else. All he wanted was that
       promise. Hungering and thirsting after that promise.
        Now, I’m kinda scratching a little hard, how many don’t care what I say at all? Esau thought
       he already had it. He said he was already born and he already had it. He didn’t worry about it no
       more. He was just slopping around, went hunting every day, wasn’t crying for more of God.
        Not Jacob - Oh mama, figure out some way. Oh mama, I got to have that birthright. Honey,
       just keep cryin. That’s what God wants, just keep hungering and crying. But you know what?
       Jacob wanted it so bad brother, he was willing to go to any means to get it. So, he stole it, he
       stole it. That’s the only kind of stealing God will recognize. He wanted that birthright and he
       stole it. He tricked his ole daddy. His blind daddy was getting old now, and his ministry’s about
       over, and Jacob tricked him. He got an old sheep skin on that smelled like his brother Esau; you
       know. And he slipped up there to his daddy and his daddy thought, well son your voice don’t
       sound like Esau, come here a little closer and he used his… a whole like a lot of us, you know,
       he smelled. A lot of times we will smell and see if it’s right. And then he felt, he said, it feels
       like Esau his hair it feels like him. But his feelings failed him and his smelling failed him to.
       BROTHER, DON’T YOU GO ON SMELLING, AND DON’T YOU GO ON FEELING, YOU
       BETTER GET A REVELATION OF THIS THING! All your senses will fail you when it comes
       to the Word of God. He smelled and felt and he went ahead and gave him the birthright.
        Now notice, he didn’t receive the birthright right then, but he got the promise of it. Because
       his daddy wasn’t dead yet. He couldn’t inherit all his cattle all his sheep, all his land, all the
       oxen, and all his goats and all his tents, and everything he owned till his daddy died.
        Now if I die my first-born son, Mark, if back under the law he would receive my trust and
       whatever I got, my house and this and that and all the change whatever it is, he’d get it, wouldn’t
       he? But now he wouldn’t get it till I die. But anyway, Jacob received the birthright right there.
        Now that’s the believer right there. Now notice Esau what happen when he seen that Jacob
       was gonna get that birthright, he hated him. Notice he didn’t care nothing about it before.
        And I have to say this, that is the spirit that is prevailing following this message. Who’s cryin
       agonizing fasting praying? Where is the all- night prayer meetings? Where is the cryin and
       travailing? There’s no place I know where they pray all night prayer meeting people fasting and
       cryin all the time. I can’t find nowhere. Down at Brother Dons, everybody’s already got it. Just
       relax, I got it. Praise the Lord, I got it.
        Notice here when Jacob got the promise of the birthright… now how many sees the picture?
       Now what’s our birthright today Brother Branham said, is the Seal of God, the coming Capstone
       Baptism of the Holy Ghost. They say, “Oh brother Lambert, I received that when I believed.”
       Nowhere in the Bible does it say that. The Bible said, “After you believed the message you,
       we’re sealed with the Token, receive your inheritance. Right?
       Ephesians 1:13-14-Reference quote:
       13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in
       whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
       14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession,
       unto the praise of his glory.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 4 - The Smyrnaean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       There it is. Paul asked, “Have you received SINCE, NOT WHEN you believed.” And there is a
       great difference there, for it is AFTER we believe that we receive. Ephesians 1:13 is an exact
       word repeat of what happened in Ephesus according to Acts 19, “In Whom ye also trusted,
       AFTER that ye heard the Word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation: in Whom also AFTER
       that ye believed (not when ye believed), ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.” Now
       here is my point. Too many of our modernists and even our fundamentalists (so-called) believe
       unto salvation at a certain specific time which in many cases is called “making a decision,” and
       that has been called receiving Christ or being born again. Now to receive Christ is to receive
       His Spirit. To receive His Spirit is to be born again. To receive His Spirit is to be baptized with
       the Holy Ghost. Amen. These folks believe. That is wonderful. But they stop there. You receive
       the Holy Ghost AFTER you believe.
        Now notice here. Now we have Jacob running, because he loves this birthright, and it gets
       him in trouble, and gets him persecuted. And who is it persecuting him? His brother! His brother
       that claims to believe the message, starts persecuting him. And he runs, because he’s humble and
       got a timid spirit he starts off running. And in his running, and he stopped at a place to rest, and
       its evening time. It’s evening time and darkness has set in. And now, Jacob the believer that is
       after the Token, the Promise, the revival, out pouring of the Holy Ghost, the Seal of God, his
       inheritance. Hungering and thirsty for God, Right? He don’t care for nothing else brother. He
       picked him out a stone and laid his head upon it, and there he begins to rest.
        And what’s he do? He has a dream. Oh glory, I just love this! He has a dream of the Third
       Pull, the Third Pull. Third pull way over in Genesis 28, ya, way over there! He lays his head
       upon a Revelation on the ground, a Revelation. And in this revelation, he has a dream. Do you
       got a dream? He has a dream laying on this rock resting. Now he does not realize where he’s at.
       He really don’t realize where he’s standing yet, see. But he’s after the birthright. He’s got a
       Promise of the Token. He’s got a Promise of the Seal of God, he’s hungering and thirsting. But
       in that, he’s got to run from his brother.
        If that ain’t going on right today. I have never went through such a battle as I’ve gone through
       in the last few years, to hang onto this what I’m hanging on to. How many of you left husbands,
       you’ve left wives, husbands kicked you right out, and wouldn’t have nothing to do with you.
       Some of you have left wives and children, because they wanted to watch television and be a part
       of the things of the world. And you’re hungry and crying for God. This congregation is full of
       suffering people here this morning, because they’re hungering and thirsting for God. Just like
       Jacob had to leave home and had to leave everything.
        And there he was, just like he was forsaken, but down in his heart he wanted that birthright.
       And that’s just like a true believer, they don’t care about the world, all they want is the fullness
       of Jesus Christ in their lives. There he laid his head upon this rock of Revelation. Here’s the
       believer now! And there he lays and he dreams a dream.
        And he dreams right where he is, and right where he’s lying, he looks up there. He remembers
       his birthright now. He looks up there… now remember this Third Pull now. He looks up there
       
       113
       and there is a ladder running from where he’s lying right up into heaven. Heavens has opened up
       and he looks up there and here comes angels down, angels coming down the ladder to Jacob.
       While thousand of them are coming down, millions of maybe, I don’t know, numerous numbers
       coming down the ladder to him. While they are coming down, others are going up. And if that
       ain’t all of it, at the top of the ladder…at the top of the ladder Jacobs said, was the Voice of the
       Lord God speaking.
        RAISE UP YOUR HANDS AND PRAISE HIM SAINTS, GLORY TO GOD!! I BELIEVE
       HE’S HERE RIGHT NOW! Do you believe He’s here? Do you believe I’m telling you the truth?
       (Yes) (Congregation is really loudly praising the Lord)
        Why can’t we receive the Holy Ghost this morning like they did on the day of Pentecost?
       Why can’t we do it?
        Watch here now! Here he is and this ladder. Here he’s is laying on a rock of faith, he’s got
       faith in the Promise of God. He’s got the birthright now, he’s got faith in it, and here he lays
       down and here he sees these angels descending and ascending and heavens opened up to Jacob.
        Don’t you realize that when you have a Revelation of what God’s gonna do in this hour, that
       all the blessings and the power of God is opened up to you as a believer? Heavens opened up to
       him, angels of God descending and ascending.
        And if that ain’t enough the Voice of the Lord God himself SPEAKIN AT THE TOP OF
       THE LADDER!! That’s none other than the pyramid message today! Jacob was lying right here,
       he looked up and he seen angels descending giving him Revelation on the Word, and on top of
       that, the Voice of the Lord God was speakin at the top of the mountain. Now listen what the Lord
       says to him. The 13th verse;
       Genesis 28:13,15,16 Ad Lib
       13 “And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father,
       and the God of Isaac: the land” [Now its spiritual to us see land, our spiritual land is what
       happen on the day of Pentecost]“whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
       15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will
       bring thee again into this land; [Restoration! Restoration children! He’s going to restore us to
       that thing. Now look here.] for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to
       thee of. [Look here, 16.]
       16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it
       not.
       Sure, the Lords in this place here. How many believe he’s in here this morning? SURE, THE
       LORD GODS IN HERE!
       Genesis 28:17-19 Scripture Reading
       17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! [here] this is none other but the
       house of God, [Oh, here it comes!] and this is the gate of heaven.
        Listen now! This is a dreadful thing here. These angels are dreadful. Said this place where I
       am here this ain’t nothing but the gates of heaven. And Peter like Jacob had a revelation to
       unlock the gate of heaven to a multitude of three thousand at the day of Pentecost. You say is
       
       114
       that all of it? Not yet! And what did he do, this is a dreadful place here. Why all heaven is open
       to me here. This is a terrible place, there’s angels thousands of them descending and ascending
       here. And on top of that I heard the voice of the God at the top of the ladder. He said, man I
       didn’t know he was in a place like that! And he said, I’m gonna name it Bethel and Bethel means
       the house of God. And the house of God is God’s bread. Where children are born in the house of
       God. Is that right!
       Genesis 28:18,19
       18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows,
       and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
       19 And he called the name of that place Beth–el: but the name of that city was called Luz at the
       first.
        Now notice here, the Third Pull was angels. And before the seals were opened, Brother
       Branham said that church was slopping around with no Revelation. Now notice when the seals
       we’re opened, was the Third Pull, which was angels, and Brother Branham said, “Angels are in
       this building while the seals were being opened.”

       20 Now, here, now here is a post, and, that’s, we’ll call that a listening post, see. And in it’s,
       got radio, see, and there is warnings and things can be done. Like a sword in your hand, see, it
       can pick from the evil or pick from only as its…it gets its message, see. 21 Now, but now, for
       instance, to the ordinary man, there has been so much cults and clans rise up, over little
       outpourings of the Spirit, until people gets all worked up in a bunch of stuff, go out and start
       another little move, and, you know, and—and thing. See? You don’t want to do that now. See?
       Now, just remember, just stay the way you are. 22 And you say, “Well, the Lord show…” No.
       Now just be careful, see. 23 Look here. Let me show you something, see. Did you know there is
       ten thousands of voices in this room right now? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Literally,
       voices of people that’s coming through the electronic waves of radio! Why don’t you hear them?
       They’re voices. That right? [“Amen.”] They’re waving right through here now. Well, there is
       peoples forms and bodies moving right through this room now. Is that right? [“Amen.”] Well,
       why don’t you see them? See? They’re here, actual voices like my voice. Well, why don’t you
       hear it? See? It’s got to strike something first, to reveal it. See? Now you understand?
       [“Amen.”] 24 Now just don’t interpret nothing. If God wants you know anything, He’ll send it
       to you. See? So just be real, real solid now. Hold still, something has happened. And now just be
       real…You understand what I mean, don’t you? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] And just
       be…Don’t try to make yourself odd, to be a Christian, because you—you take yourself away
       from God. And you—you—you… 25 If you can understand it, THIS IS THAT THIRD PULL.
       See? You—you should have caught that, the other day. See? So then, just remember, there’ll be
       no impersonation like there was of the other two. See? So, that’s as far as you—you should know
       now. Just—just remember that… 26 You see, now, there is something taking place in this room,
       and there is Something here. There is—there is, actual, in this room, Angels, Voice of God. See?

       But how do you…You can’t…If you can’t hear the natural voice, without something to send it
       out, how you going to hear the spiritual Voice? 27 Now you might make-believe that somebody is
       singing this certain song. They might not even be there, see. But when it actually strikes the
       crystal that it’s supposed to strike, then it gives a true interpretation, and show, vindicates it by
       showing the picture. See what I mean? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] 28 Now, the Spirit
       of God, when It speaks through the true Word, It vindicates Itself, to show Itself, that It’s
       right. You understand now?

       64-1221 - Why It Had To Be Shepherd
       William Marrion Branham
       7 Now, that same thing was here when Adam was here. Television was here when—when Elijah
       set on Mount Carmel. It was here when Martin Luther, that young priest, throwed the
       communion on the floor and said, “It’s kosher! And the just shall live by faith.” It was here then,
       but we are just now finding it. And it’s also so, that in our presence tonight is God, Angels,
       supernatural beings that’s unseen to our natural sense of sight. But someday it’ll be a reality
       just as television is now, and just as common. Now, that is why I believe the Word.
        So, it was the Revelation from the opening off the seals, by the angels of God establishes the
       church of Jesus Christ, which is the house of God. So, help me that’s the truth. Is that right?
       Think about it children.
        Bethel mean the house of God. And the only place that those ministering angels are going to
       be is in the church of the living God, which is the house of God. Oh, here it comes. Oh God!
        Notice here that Jacob did not have his name changed yet. But it was after this visitation from
       those angels that Jacob returned back in desperation, and he grabbed a hold of the same one that
       spoke at the top of the ladder and wrestled with him till day light.
        HE IS HERE SAINTS, THE SAME ONE I’M SPEAKIN OF IS RIGHT HERE!!!! GIVE
       HIM PRAISE GLORY TO GOD! Amen!
        Notice here, that Jacob is scared of his brothers that don’t care nothing about revival, they
       don’t care nothing about God moving, they don’t care nothing about the birthright, but they’re
       after Jacob! But Jacob here receives a great Revelation from God by the visitation of these
       angels. And the house of God is established there by these angels. Right?
        Oh, here it is now! Now God put his name in His house. My house, you come over to my
       house, the name of that house is Lambert. And everybody in that house goes by the name of
       Lambert. I’m getting ready to say something.
        Now notice, Jacob knew he would have to come and face Esau over this birthright. And his
       spirit is so timid, he’s afraid of Him. And in his desperation, he’s got to find him in His power.
       And he comes back…come back and receive that Promise, go back in the Promise Land, see.
       And when he comes back, he meets angels again. He meets theses angels again and there he
       wrestled with an angel all night long. Is that right? And he grabbed ahold of him and he grab him
       right around the neck and won’t let him go.
       
       116
        Hold on just a minute. The angel said, let me go, it’s coming day light! He said, I ain’t gonna
       let you go, till you give me power for service. No, let me go, Jacob said, No. I ain’t gonna let you
       go. You got to get desperate saints! Get ahold of Him, wrestle with Him! I ain’t gonna let you go
       till you bless me! And he touched him and He blessed him! And He said, I changed your name,
       I’m gonna give you a new name. Your name will no more be Jacob but shall be Israel, for thou
       hast prevailed over God, and thou hast power with God and with man, and thou art a prince
       among the people. And I give you a new name! And Jacob said, thank you Lord! Hold it now,
       listen! He said, now you tell me your name? Oh, Lord, children. Showing you, that the elected
       predestinated believer, that’s after the fullness of God, the promise of the hour, gets the change
       of name, and also finds out the Revelation of Jehovah’s name!!! Do you believe! Oh Lord!
       Children it ain’t nothing but the grace of God to come on us.
        Alright, you say is that scriptural? Yes, it’s right in the Bible, I’ve proved it by the scripture.
       Let’s prove it by the prophet. Brother Branham said that at the opening of the seals. Why do you
       think you shout and scream and holler and don’t get nothing? It will be revealed in the Thunders!
       And it’s that Voice of that mighty angel, in Revelation 10:1 that had the covenant over his head,
       that’s the covenant, the Seal of God coming to the believer.

       ascended on High, He received a new Name. That’s the reason you holler the way they do, and

       32 And in this stone was “a name,” a name that no one knowed but the one who received it
       himself. He knew it, but no one else could know it but him. So when you hear these guy’s flatter
       you, telling theirs; they’re “John,” they’re “Paul,” they’re “Mary,” they’re “this,” “that,” or
       the “other.” Don’t you believe it, ’cause if it was, he’d never say nothing about it. See? That’s
       right. He has to keep it to hisself. He knowed. No one knowed but he himself, but he knowed
       because every perfect overcomer receives a new name in that—that—that way. 33 Did you notice
       Abraham was called Abram, but when God went to use him, He changed his name to
       “Abraham.” S-a-r-r-a was Sarra, but when God was going to use her, He changed her name to
       S-a-r-r-a-h: Sarah, “princess.” Do you know that Jacob…? Jacob was “supplanter.” Esau
       means “red,” hairy and red; red-headed, and red all over, is Esau. Now, and Jacob was
       “supplanter.” And supplanter is a “deceiver.” Didn’t Esau say, “Isn’t his name called Jacob,
       ‘supplanter’?” But when he wrestled with the Lord all night long, and overcome, and was
       blessed, God changed his name; Jacob to Israel, “a prince with God.” Paul was called Saul
       until he met the Holy Spirit in the form of a Light that shined down upon him, his name was
       changed from Saul to “Paul.” Simon, when he met Jesus, He changed his name to “Peter.”
       That… 34 And when Jesus overcome, His Name was changed. And He would reveal that
       Name, “He that would be with Him, overcome as He has, he received a new name; and I’ll
       reveal My new Name to him.” See? And every overcomer, I mean, among such as that: them
       leaders and so forth. Now, all the children of Israel didn’t get their name changed, of course.
       That’s right. But those high leaders, when they overcome, they had received a new name. See
       how it dovetails in? Just perfectly. 35 And now we find out that he also got “hidden manna.”
       Now, hidden manna is typed to the shewbread. The shewbread was for priests alone. That is
       right. Shewbread was just for the priest. And they…It was a special thing made for the priest,
       that is, the leaders; and this man overcome. The whole congregation got manna, but he got a
       hidden (special) manna, OR A “SPECIAL REVELATION,” OH, OF WHO JESUS WAS, and
       what about Him, all about Him. See, he got that revelation if he had overcome, to the angel.
       “Hold fast, for he that…” He had overcome.
        Children as sure as I stand here, this message come from the Lord Jesus! If this never come
       from God, then I’m lost as lost can be. If I don’t know the presence of God, and if that ain’t Him
       in here, then I’ve never been in His presence. Think of that! Here’s Bethel, the church of God
       established, and his name and everything is in it. It’s the gateway to heaven.
        Notice the opening of the seals brings all these things that I’m speaking to you of. How we
       ought to praise Him and thank him for these great things He’s doing. Now, how many knows…
       now just ten minutes, and I’ll close this out.
       
       118
        Notice that God can only reveal himself in three names. What are they? He revealed himself
       through the seven church ages as what? Son of God, he reveals himself in the millennium as the
       Son of David and there’s only one other name left and that is the Son of Man. Is that so?
        Now notice in the end-time as it was as the days of Noah the Son of Man will be revealed.
       That’s not one man, but that’s God tabernacled in a human being. How many say amen to that?
       (Amen)
        Now notice that we’re livin in the day of the eagle. Those four powers went out and the last
       power was the eagle power and that is a prophetic anointing, where God comes down in an
       individual and talks out. We’re not gonna see the Lord Jesus’s body when He comes. We don’t
       see that, till we see Him in the air. But you’ll have to recognize who He’s, in, and where His
       Voice is at, by the Revealed Word. Because you can’t separate the Revealed Word from the
       Bridegroom. Brother Branham said that He comes in a ministry of the full body Revealed
       Revelation. And that is the carcass, and the carcass is the body, and where ever the carcass is,
       there you will find eagles gathered eagles. Now hold it!

        Now notice, these angels descending and ascending, and this is the gateway to heaven where
       all the Revelation is, and the supernatural blessings of God flow.
        Oh friend, I got something here that’s tremendous.
        Now open up to John. Just let me quote it to you. Listen here now! Listen to Jesus speakin to
       His disciples. Oh, just turn over to it, and look at it right in the Word. John 1:51.
       I never …the Lord revealed this sitting there this morning. All I know he was right in the room, I
       never seen this before in my life! Now let’s read a starting at 48. John 1:48 you got it?
       John 1:48-49-Scripture Reading;
       48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him,
       Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. [Now there’s
       Jesus’s second pull say amen. Discerning the secrets of the heart Brother Branham said was the
       second pull. Right?]
       49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, [When he saw this second pull] Rabbi, thou art the
       Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
       50 Jesus answered and said unto him, [Now who was Jesus? He was the revealed word wasn’t
       he?] Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater
       things than these.
       51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and
       the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
       
        Children think about it! DO YOU REALIZE WHAT’S HAPPENING? It’s got to be! Now
       notice here, the Second Pull was discerning the secrets of the heart. Jesus said, why Nathanael do
       you marvel at this Second Pull? He said, you’ll see greater than this second pull Pull. Said, here
       after… IN OTHER WORDS COMING AFTER THE SECOND PULL, WILL COME THE
       THIRD PULL, WHICH IS ANGELS DESCENDING AND ASCENDING AND HEAVEN
       OPENING COMING UP OUT THE SON OF MAN. AND THE VOICE OF THE
       BRIDEGROOM IS THE SON OF MAN.
        Do you want another one? Do you believe? Now listen, here it comes it’s a good one. Listen
       to this scripture. We haven’t come to Mount Sinai we’ve come to another mountain. Look here
       children, this is mount Zion here. (Brother Lambert pointing to stature of a perfect man.)
       Hebrews 12:22-Scripture Reading;
       22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
       Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
        GLORY TO GOD! YOU’RE COMING INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD WHERE THE
       REVELATION IS, AND ANGELS DESCENDING AND ASCENDING UPON A MAN
       GIVING HIM THE REVELATION OF GOD’S WORD.
        I can’t help it, I got to say it. God gives witness to it that I told you the truth! I TELL YOU
       THERE IS SOMETHING COMING THAT’S GONNA SHAKE THIS WORLD!!
        We ain’t playing church no more children. Something supernatural is going on, and people
       don’t know that. Alright if you got any doubt? I can stand here all day, it’s not me but I say by
       the grace of God I can stand here in my tracks four days and dove tail the whole Bible in there.
       
       120
       How many say, Amen! Not one time has it ever failed, not one time, It’s God. WE’RE LIVING

       GONNA FALL.
        Jesus Second Pull discerning the secrets of the heart, but the devil beat that to death. Then
       come angels. And there’s only one-way, Brother Branham said, that God can move today and
       that is the Son of Man.
        First, he appears in the Son of Man, Malachi 4:5, in the Shout. He goes away and is taken off
       the scene. And then He lowers himself down with more power with them angels. No more birds,
       no more doves, but angels. And they are descending and ascending all the time bringing the
       Revelation from God from them Seals to the believers.

       Well, see, there’s where I do wrong. One time should settle it forever (See?) With every
       congregation. It can be really proven of God and from the Scripture, and God does it one time,
       that should settle it. 4 Every time Moses… Could you imagine meet—meeting someone, say,
       “Now, wait a minute; I want to show you the Lord sent me. See, my hand’s leprosy now. Now it’s
       clean. See this stick? It’s a snake. Now it’s a stick.” Wait and get to the next Hebrew and say,
       “Now here, here’s my hand; it’s leprosy.” Oh, no. He did it one time, and that’s it. See? They all
       believed it. But the Lord never sent me to do all this; I do it upon my own accord. And that’s the
       reason it bothers me so bad. SOON, THERE’S SOMETHING GREATER THAN THIS
       COMING; IT’LL SOON BE HERE. IT’LL BE MARVELOUS THEN, if the Lord willing.
       How many ever read my last vision that’s been wrote up in the magazine? WAIT TILL YOU

       FORWARD TO GREAT THINGS TO HAPPEN. 5 How many read the sermon, “When
       Omnipotence Speaks, Miracles Happen”? Did you? You believe that? Certainly. Omnipotent
       spoke at ever junction. And when the Church cooled off, and, then Omnipotence spoke; miracles
       takes place. And this is the junction of all junctions; this is the end time. The end of the whole
       history of the world is right now at hand. SO YOU CAN EXPECT OMNIPOTENCE TO
       SPEAK, AND YOU CAN EXPECT THE GREATEST AND MIGHTIEST MIRACLES
       THAT’S EVER HAPPENED ON THE EARTH will happen in the next few years to come, if
       Jesus tarries. It will be.
        AND THIS IS MOUNT ZION, THIS IS THE HOUSE OF GOD, spiritual food in due season.
       People that are after the birthright, people that are persecuted, talked about, run down. Oh God!
       And to the general assembly and to the church of the first born, did not Brother Branham say that
       the seed will not heir with the shuck? The shuck is the church, see Haggar. But the heirs are the

       Brother, that just ain’t talkin about the new city coming down on a new earth. That’s the Bride
       who has their names written on the Lambs Book of Life. They come into a place where there is
       an accompany of enumerable angels bringing them into Revelation of God and for the hour and
       to their inheritance. Watch I’ll show it! And to the God, where angels descending and ascending
       and the Lord God right at the top of there. To the God the judge of all and to the spirit of justified
       men. That couldn’t be over in the millennium. To the spirits of men that are justified by a
       Revelation, they are being made perfect. Oh God!! By the descending and ascending of the
       angels of the revealed Word of God.
       Hebrews 12:23-Scripture Reading;
       23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God
       the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
        WE’RE NOT PERFECT THIS MORNING! BUT WE’RE BEING MADE PERFECT BY
       THE REVEALING OF BLEEDING WORD OF GOD. WE’RE BEING WASHED BY THE
       REVELATION OF GOD THAT’S BEING RELEASED BY THESE ANGELS!
        Friends do we realize, what’s taken place in our midst! All right here’s something, let’s go on
       and finish it up! Verse 25.
       Hebrews 12:25-Scripture Reading:
       25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake
       on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
        “See that you refuse not him that speaketh.” Watch out, showing you that it’s not a man
       speakin! Hold it now! Did not the prophet of God… did I not read to you over five places where
       he said, when he left the earth there’d be a ministry of the full body revealed word, that could
       only be the Lord Jesus Himself the Bridegroom? And Brother Branham said, the only way
       people could recognize the Bridegroom is to be constantly in the Word of God and prayer
       because He will be the Revealed Word, and the Revealed Word is the Third Pull and the Third
       Pull is angels, and the Third Pull IS THE SON OF MAN. Truth! Somebody is gonna find that!
       And then where you find that those angels, you may not see them but they’re there, you can feel
       their presence, revealing the Word by the Son of Man. What is it? God hidden in somebody.

       111 Enoch and them built it, years ago, and it stands for a symbol. Just the same as the sun rises
       and sets; just the same as the tree drops its—its leaf, and comes back again; as a fish, and the
       cattle, and everything else symbolizes it. That pyramid stands as a symbol. 112 Go into the
       prophet’s chamber and watch them seven steps. Where did the—where did the guard meet the
       challenge to bring the comer into the presence of the king? At the top of the steps; was in the
       seventh step. There shows that we’ve got to come again with that same Spirit that was on John;
       
       122
       he introduced the Messiah. He was greater than all the prophets; he introduced It. And we’ve
       got to come to a place, again, to something that’s going to introduce the Messiah. 113 AND
       HOW WILL THE MESSIAH…THE PEOPLE THAT’S BELIEVING HIM KNOW IT
       UNLESS THEY’RE CONSTANTLY IN THE WORD, TO KNOW WHAT HE IS! Daniel said,
       “The wise shall know; but the foolish, the unwise, wouldn’t know. They shall know their God.”
       NOW, NOW, HOW HE SHALL APPEAR IN THE LAST DAYS, IS TO BRING THE
       PEOPLE BACK TO THE WORD, SO THAT THE BRIDE WILL KNOW HER HUSBAND,
       KNOW HER MATE, THE REVEALED WORD. THAT’S WHY THIS HAS TO HAPPEN.
        Brother Branham said, the Bridegroom, the Voice, will make the Word of God so plain to the
       people that it will unite the believers to the Bridegroom. And we’re being united to the headstone
       coming by His Revelation. If we walk in the light as He’s in the light, we’ll have fellowship with
       one another. By this revelation and the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the bleeding revealed
       word of God cleansing us from all sin. He that is born of this Revelation, like Jacob, cannot sin
       because the seed of faith remain in him. He cannot doubt that Word. He says, amen, amen! Even
       so do it.
       1 John 1:7-Reference Scripture:
       7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the

       miserable self, could let my little heart see that, see.
       Hebrews 12:25-Scripture Reading:
       25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake
       on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
       
        See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. Watch here now! For if they escaped not who
       refused him that spake on earth… Oh Brother, if you refuse him, Malachi 4:5 (William
       Branham), that spoke on earth, whatcha you gonna do about the Voice that’s speakin from
       heaven?
        Remember Brother Branham said, that the angel in Revelation 10:7 was him, but the angel in
       Revelation 10:1 was Christ, the mighty angel was Christ. And Christ is the anointed Revealed
       Word. And the Revealed Word has got that covenant the Rainbow. He’s bringing you into the
       unadulterated Bride covenant, hidden from the foundation of the world!! My Lord! See that you
       refuse not him that spoke on earth much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that
       speaketh from heaven.
        Hold it right there! Brother Branham said, the Lord Jesus Christ shall be revealed from
       heaven right after the days of my ministry. How many say, Amen. (Amen) He said it!

       He said, “Oh, yes, you did laugh.” That was the Angel bringing the last message before fire fell
       from heaven. Jesus said, “As it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, so will it be in the
       days that the Son of man is revealed from heaven.” You see the message? “When the Son of
       man is revealed from heaven…” 20 Now, when this Angel went to Sodom and begin to speak
       His message through a man, they mocked at Him and laughed at Him. And they would not
       receive the message. Neither do they do it today. It’s the very same thing, and they won’t
       believe it. There’s only one thing left; that’s judgment.

       William Marrion Branham
       So He had to be identified to the world; and that day down on the river, when He walked down to
       prove Hisself God’s Masterpiece (that I talked about this morning)…When He was obedient to
       walk into the water… 100 Now, if you notice there, there’s a great lesson. John was the greatest
       man on earth, at the time. Jesus said, “There never was a man borned of a woman as great as
       he,” to that time. And he was a prophet. You believe that? Now, remember, if the Word of God
       will come to anything in the land, it’ll be a prophet. That’s always God’s way. Do you believe
       that Jesus was the Word manifested in flesh? So there’s only one way He can come to be
       introduced; not by the priests. 101 He didn’t go up and say, “Caiaphas, will you introduce Me?”
       If He did, He made the same mistake that David did in our lesson the other day; see, if He went
       up to the church, and said, “Will you introduce Me?” 102 Just notice when He was borned,
       even. When He was borned, He was borned in the shadow of the church. And they was probably
       rang the bells and everything, but it was shepherds that recognized Him, and Magi. See? 103
       And here He is now, on…ready for His ministry. And if He is the Word… 104 According to
       God’s great plan, the Word can only…“The Lord God does nothing until He first reveals It to
       His servants the prophets.” That’s always His pattern, has to be; when the Seals were opened,
       when anything else. Any major event taking place in the earth, God reveals it to His prophets.
       105 And John was the prophet, for he was prophesying “He’d come.” 106 Then down off the
       side of a hill one day…when a discussion was going on, a bunch of priests standing around. And
       they said, “Do you mean to tell me that you call yourself a ‘prophet,’ and stand over there in
       
       124
       that mud?” (not in a church, because they wouldn’t have him) “Stand over that mud, and tell me
       that the hour’s coming when the great Jehovah Who ordained these sacrifices, when great
       Jehovah Who built this temple, Who came into it as a Pillar of Fire, ‘the day will come when that
       daily sacrifice will be taken away’?” 107 HE SAID, “THERE WILL COME A MAN, AND
       HE’S AMONG YOU NOW (SOMEWHERE OUT THERE), AND HE WILL TAKE AWAY
       THE SIN.” The priest was discussing it with him. 108 John looked up! Now, what is he? The
       prophet! AND HERE IS THE WORD, THERE COMES THE WORD COMING RIGHT
       STRAIGHT TO THE PROPHET, RIGHT TO THE WATER. JOHN SAID, “BEHOLD, THE
       LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. There He is, that’s
       Him.” Jesus never spoke a word, walked right out into the water. And I can see there, standing
       in that water (think of a drama), two of the greatest that ever struck the earth: God the Word,
       and His prophet. 109 NOTICE, THE WORD COME TO THE PROPHET IN THIS
       DISPENSATION OF GRACE, IN THE WATER (UH-HUH). I THOUGHT YOU’D CATCH
       IT (UH-HUH). IN THE WATER! THE FIRST REVELATION OF THE WORD WAS IN
       THE WATER. NOW YOU SEE WHERE THE BRIDE STARTED, THE EVENING-LIGHT
       MESSAGE? IN THE WATER! THE WORD, TRUE WORD not mixed up with creeds, but
       come to the prophet in the water, by the water. 110 Notice! Could you imagine the eyes of the
       Word and the eyes of the prophet meeting in the water? Oh, that’s too much for me. There stood
       the prophet, there stood the Word, looking in each others’ eyes. And the prophet said, “I have
       need to be baptized of Thee, why comest Thou unto me?” 111 And the Word said…It has to be
       true. Now let me give a drama here: 112 “John, you’re a prophet, you know the Word.” See?
       “You recognize Me, you know Who I am.” 113 “I have need to be baptized of Thee,” John said.
       114 Jesus said, “Suffer that to be so. That’s exactly right, you do have need to be baptized of Me.
       But remember, John, being a prophet, it is behooving to us, or becoming to us (as the Word and
       the prophet), that we fulfill every Word. Uh-huh. For, John,” (here’s the revelation now) “John,
       you know Who I am, I am the Sacrifice. AND ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD, THE
       SACRIFICE HAD TO BE WASHED BEFORE IT WAS PRESENTED FOR SACRIFICE.”
       IS THAT RIGHT? THE WORD…“THE LAMB WAS WASHED AND THEN PRESENTED
       FOR SACRIFICE, AND I AM THAT LAMB. AND I MUST BE WASHED BEFORE I CAN
       BE PRESENTED TO THE WORLD FOR A SACRIFICE. SUFFER IT TO BE SO, JOHN,
       FOR THUS IT IS BECOMING TO US AS THE WORD AND THE PROPHET
       TOGETHER.”
        Alright now watch here!

        “Whose Voice” Here’s the Voice of the Bridegroom. “Whose Voice then shook the earth.”
       But now, did not Brother Branham’s ministry shake the earth? He said it did. Was he not the
       third angel of Revelation 14? And was not the Revelation 14 the highlight of his whole
       preaching, the main message was to receive the Seal of God, or take the mark of the beast.

       This morning, the message this morning was, to me, the highlights Message of my entire

       how it come about. And I know that everything has worked for months and months and months,
       up to that one Message, moving up to come to that place. That was the capping-off time of it, you
       see. And it’s a… 10 Now I’m sure, or hope, that you got what the Token meant. See? The
       Token is the sign that the Blood has been applied. That, the price that’s been asked, required
       of God, Jesus paid that price by shedding His Own Blood. He did that. Then, from His life
       came the Holy Spirit. And when the Blood is applied to you, the Holy Spirit is a Token that
       your price is paid; God has received you, and that’s the Token. Remember, that is the Token.
       Now, there is many people who doesn’t, they—they don’t know what that Token is, see. And you
       have to make it like that nobody knows it, see, so that all of them will get it.
       
        It said, see that you refuse him not that spoke on earth. But after that, there’s gonna be a
       greater Voice speak from Heaven. And the Voice from heaven vindicates the Voice that was on
       earth. That’s why Brother Branham said, he will come after the opening of these seals and prove
       that they come from God, or I’m a false Prophet. He knew that the Lord Jesus was Revelation
       10:1. His Voice then shook the earth, but now he comes saying… Yet once more I shake not the
       earth only, but also heaven. Watch here, let see if the Word of God lies. “And this word, yet once
       more,” that’s a prophecy! “Signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things
       that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.” There’s your Bride, that’s
       the only one that can’t be shaken! Gates of hell can’t prevail against the Revelation.

       50 Same Holy Spirit that saved the Lutherans; that sanctified the Methodists; that baptized the
       Pentecostals; is now setting in order the Coming of the Lord Jesus. When, it’ll be so powerful,
       that Body, will come into this Group, a Church, that’ll draw the rest of them from the grave.
       There’ll be a resurrection. That’s what the Holy Ghost is for. What is the Holy Ghost? “Without
       us they cannot be made perfect.” They lived in one day, under that. We live in another day.
       “When the enemy comes in like a flood, I’ll…the Spirit of God will raise a standard against it.”
       See? We’re in a day now…
       
        Let’s bow our heads. Oh children! As our sisters come to the piano and organ.
        Now, children it’s a fearful thing, search your hearts real good. I’ve told you the truth. You
       know that’s the Bible and the Word of God. We’re standing in a terrible place. Without this great
       
       127
       inheritance, without coming into that great capstone, baptism Seal of God, we cannot go in the
       rapture, we don’t have nothing to rapture us. This is the hour to overcome, lay aside every weight
       every sin that so easily besets you. Love the Lord Jesus with all your heart and stay in the Word
       of God and prayer until we can become the Word.
        While our sisters play the song, I Love Him.
        I know I took a long time, but I know this come from God! I know it come from God! And
       the Lord give this to me because I love him. And my whole heart’s desire is to see every child of
       God be filled with the Holy Ghost. That’s all the desire that I have, is to see the Lord Jesus
       glorified. I love Him with all my heart.
        Now with our heads bowed and every eye closed, let’s seriously take stock. How many say
       Brother Bob, I know that come from the Lord, and I want with all of my heart, I want to be in
       that great body of Christ? Whatever part he’s got, I want it. And say, pray for me with an up
       lifted hand.
        God bless all those hands, God bless you. God see’s your hands. Is that all you want out of
       our lives today is to be in that place to sit in heavenly places with angels and miracles and signs
       and wonders and so filled with the living God with the living water that you’ll never thirst again?
       Think of it children, when you receive God like that, you’ll never thirst, you’ll never hunger. It’ll
       just be in you a river of living water flowing out all the time.
        Brother Lambert gives the closing prayer:
        Now Father, we’ve spoke of you this morning. God we’ve lifted up your Word, exalted thy
       Revelation and the name of Jesus. And Lord we want to see you come and bring down every
       high and lofty spirit. Everything that exalts itself, bring it down low, Lord. And Lord we pray
       that you’ll exalt your humble little children. Lord, bring the mountains down and those that are in
       the valley, lift them up high! God help us to be sincere and humble, Lord.
        Lord, we look for that perfect love. God, we see all kinds of faults and blemishes in us. Lord,
       how we pray that you’ll give us grace and power to overcome all these things. And Lord, that the
       bleeding Word of God, of divine Revelation, may wash us and cleanse us.
        And Lord, may the gates open wide this morning or tonight, soon Lord, that we may enter
       into that great Kingdom of Heaven. And Lord, there would raise up a Bride that would prove that
       your alive, that would go into all the world and shake the nation, shake this old dead church
       world, prove that William Branham was your prophet, God. Take your little Bride home Lord.
        Now Father, we pray that before you do Lord, there may be people in this assembly, God that
       will rise up and take their inheritance and shake the kingdoms, Lord. For you said, that every
       kingdom will be shaken, that only the Kingdom of Heaven will remain.
        Now Father God, we pray that you’ll bless this message poorly preached Lord, but I’m a poor
       little ole ignorant, disciple. Lord, I feel I’m not even worthy to even call myself your servant, but
       Lord how I love you! Oh, God, how I love your Revelation.
        Lord, how I pray that you’ll triumph over all the unbelief, to bring your people that are called
       by your name, and names that are in the book, may you bring them unto perfection and into the
       unity of your Revelation. In Jesus name we ask it, Amen.
        Let’s stand to our feet. (Congregation sings, I Love Him.)
       Now let’s bow our heads again. I’d worship the Lord a little longer but I know I just wore you
       out. May you come back tonight and if he don’t do this thing before we get out, then I’ll be
       
       128
       looking for it tonight. I’ll be looking for it tonight. How many be looking for it tonight? You
       want that? It’s a promise! Has He ever failed one promise? If you’re hungry and thirsty, He’s
       duty bound to do it!
        Let’s reverently and humbly. We ask our Brother Frank Paste to demises us in a word of
       prayer.
        God bless you and remember the service tonight. I think Brother Don will minister for us

        blessed with those special songs. I certainly do appreciate God blessing His wonderful brothers
        and sisters singing for the Lord. That certainly was a blessing. How many say, Amen?
         I just don’t know any assembly that God has blessed any more with God given talent as we
        have here. And I certainly love to come in and see people worshipping the Lord. I believe if you
        love the Lord Jesus you can’t just help but just sing to Him, and make love to Him from your
        heart. To me that’s one of the signs of being in love with the Lord, is being able to worship the
        Lord in the spirit. You can’t hardly worship the Lord in the spirit if you really don’t love Him
        and you’re afraid of your neighbor’s looking at you or something. But if you just love Him you
        just got your mind so on Him and your heart, you just don’t know that anybody is around you.
        So that’s wonderful to be able to worship the Lord in the spirit and in the truth. Now I’m glad it’s
        that way: in the spirit and in the truth. A lot of people think they are worshipping the Lord
        tonight, but they’re not worshipping Him in the truth. He won’t receive that kind of worship;
        He’ll only receive a worship that’s a God-given Revelation in your heart and you worship Him
        by that truth. And then if you worship Him in that truth, then you’re worshipping Him in the
        spirit. How many say, Amen? How you worship the Lord, in the spirit of the Revelation in the
        truth because no man can call Jesus his Lord only by the Holy Ghost. So that’s the way that we
        worship the Lord is by a Revelation of God in our heart.

         And we’re just thrilled and excited… how many… Shirley was talking this afternoon in the
        room and she said, “Sunday is so hard, after Sunday morning service so much is said and I try to
        get it all my in my head and it hurts. I just have to lay down and rest or I just can’t make it
        Sunday night.”
         You know, truly sometimes I go home and my head hurts and I think of all these things that’s
        been said and then I realize I have to give an account for them, see. It makes me runner back
        down through there on a plum line and see my life and go back to whence it came from, and how
        I got here and who was it that appeared there, and watching it run. Then I think Lord… many
        times I’m alone with the Lord, and I say Lord I love those people so much, I love your people so
        much, I said, wouldn’t it be terrible Lord if I told them wrong! Lord what if I told them a lie. Oh,
        I said, I’d rather die of an infectious cancer, let a train run over me, kill me in any way that you
        can, but don’t never let me tell one of your children something wrong.
        
        2
         So, then I know that if the Word… and I lay right on my… prayer and the Word of God day
        after day, year in and year out, staying in the room alone with the Lord. And then I know that
        great presence that’s coming and revealing that great Word and I see it right there running right
        in the Word of God and running right along just a plum line, and then I know that’s Him. Then
        my little heart clearly rejoices that God has given me bread for the children. And that makes me
        feel good. Then, no matter how great the things are said and you see God’s sheep eating God’s
        bread, the carcass for this hour, the body the revealed Word. And then you think Lord could that
        be us now, my… and then well it has to be somebody. And just to think, Lord I’m just so
        thankful that you let my little heart see that.
         It’s like the great prophet, Brother Branham said, since the Seals were opened, the Bible

        that's been hid, is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10, He would do it. And we are
        the privileged people that God has chosen, of the earth, that we might see and understand these
        things; which is not some mythical, fleshly mind of a person trying to make it up. It's the Word of
        God made manifest, proven, that It's right. Proven, not by science; but by God, that It's right.
        God, as I have said before in a message, God doesn't need anyone to interpret His Word. He is
        His Own interpreter. He says it'll happen, and it happens. That's, He—He confirms it, that
        interprets it.

        “It became a new Book to me after I went to the east.”
         Now here we are six years later now and many things have happened, a great Revelation is
        coming forth in a little ole humble… Of course, anybody could say that, anybody can get up and
        say what you want to, but it’s another thing for it to be. And be waiting for the great out pouring
        of the Holy Ghost that’s been promised for this hour. Course we know, all over the country and
        around the world, they say all the Catholics are coming in, that the Pope will even be saved. He
        won’t! I assure you he won’t, and they won’t either. But there’ll be a little end time Bride that
        really receives Christ.
         How many love His Word more every day? Now your kinda gettin that out of you about how
        the coming of the Lord is gonna be, aren’t you?
        
        3
        We always had that seeded into us, how the coming of the Lord was, He just come down and
        appeared in the heavens with His resurrected body, and all of us left the earth. Well now, that’s
        part of it. His coming and the secret rapture, is two different things. Two different things
        altogether. How many caught that this morning? The coming of the Lord Jesus now, today, He
        comes in a… it’s really three parts. He comes descending from heaven with a Shout, that’s
        Malachi 4:5 bringing the message. Right! Then He comes as the Voice, that’s the Bridegroom.
        Now, both of those are the Word, the Shout is a prophet, Son of Man. The only way that God can
        reveal himself is Son of Man.

        130 THREE THINGS HAPPENS: A voice…A SHOUT, A VOICE, A TRUMPET, has to
        happen before Jesus appears. Now, a shout…Jesus does all three of them when He’s He’s—
        He’s—He’s descending.
        A shout, what is the shout? It’s the Message going forth, first, the living Bread of Life bringing
        forth the Bride.
         You know everybody in this congregation could get that just seeded in your heart by a
        Revelation, about the Son of Man. Don’t think about the man, but think about the Son of Man.
        That seems to be so hard for people. But what it is, see, you hear Brother Branham come out and
        announce all over, I got a message from the Lord God, and then he would get all excited and say
        I’m going to preach on the Mighty God revealed. And he was so thrilled about that, and that was
        a great message.
         Well, everybody was just talking about that message. Boy, that was all I heard. Oh, the
        ‘Mighty God Revealed’. Oh, let’s try to get to that... It was just a total hush all over the county
        about Brother Branham announcing that. And we went there…And to me when he preached it,
        and to me it was just so simple. I seen that years ago, you know. And then after he brought it,
        they still didn’t understand it. Well, that’s a marvel isn’t it! The mighty God revealed and still
        nobody knows the mighty God revealed. I used to go out and hold my head and cry and say,
        Lord is something wrong with me? I was always an odd duckling, you know. See you down at
        Jerry’s have a soda and a hamburger you know. And there’s the great message, the Mighty God
        Revealed, and they said, it’s all over you know.
         But the mighty God is gonna be revealed. He’s gonna be revealed in human flesh, the Son of
        Man. Now Son of Man… the whole body of Jesus Christ. We believe that the whole body of
        Jesus Christ…God is gonna come into a multimembered body and that will be called, the Bride.
        Now, of course out here we’ve said this is the Bride and that’s the Bride and the Methodist is the
        Bride and the Baptist is the Bride, and the Pentecostal their the Bride. And they ended up going
        into the World Council of Churches, just as hard as they can go. Which is the mark of the beast.
        But now there’s got to be a Bride. And that ministry of the Son of Man is the only way that He’s
        revealing Himself after the church ages.
         And that doesn’t make any difference who the man could be, that’s not an important thing at
        all. The important thing is the revealed Word and that revealed Word is the Bridegroom. That
        
        4
        revealed Word of God is Jehovah God and He’s hidden and to be revealed in human flesh. See!
        Now Jehovah God was hid. He was hid in the Shout, but He is to be revealed in the Voice.
         Now see, that come fresh there! See, just talking, and we see how that Revelation… how
        many just got that? I didn’t know see that just like that! I’ve seen it at different angles, but I’ve
        never seen it like that before. That was good, let’s go back over that again.
         Now see He comes; He comes with 1 Thessalonians 4. The Lord Himself shall descend from
        heaven with a Shout. Now that Shout, that Shout is God hidden in human flesh. But notice that
        the Voice that He is using of the man and you know who it was. The Voice, that He was using
        when He would be speaking. Now of course, see a lot of people can’t balance that. Now they
        think that’s Jehovah God walking around all the time speaking, see everything he says. No.
        When the anointing’s there, when that supernatural presence comes and anoints that vessel, he
        yields himself then he speaks out in first person. Now that’s the Shout!
        1 Thessalonians 4:16-Reference quote:
        16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with A SHOUT, WITH THE VOICE of the
        archangel, AND WITH THE TRUMP OF GOD: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
         Brother Branham would wait for the angel of the Lord, till that presence would come. Now,
        there is no way a man that can get into that anointing, it takes God to put you there. You can’t
        fast your way into it.
         When He walks up beside you, why then it’s just a little… now Brother Branham tried to
        explain all that. I’m not going to make the mistake he did, your just gonna have to believe it. But
        I know how it operates, see. But, I… believe me if I could, I’d push a button, yes sir boy I’d
        operate it right tonight. Brother Arthur Graybill, I’d be right here operating pushing the button all
        the time, as hungry to see it as I want it.
         But see, it is a great super, super, super, supernatural anointing of God that he no doubt…
        What I believe it is that angel of the Lord that come near Brother Branham, that anointing, and…
        I’ve seen that operate, and I’ve had that operate just like it was in Brother Branham, but it’s left
        it’s gone see. It just wasn’t the hour and of course I didn’t listen to the Lord and disobeyed him
        and got messed up with preachers. But anyway, it’ll be down the road in its own time. It’s all the
        will of God and will work out. But that supernatural presence of God comes near, that great
        super anointing… and it just… see your just made up in such a way... God made you and
        foreordained you in such a way that you just relax and yield yourself and then God is down in
        that man. God’s spirit, God’s spirit is down in that man, the Lord Jesus’s spirit, the one that you
        love and feel, is down in there in that man.
         He was down in that man in the Shout. And naturally, you walk around normally, well you
        walk around him, he’s just like anybody else. But now when it comes time for the ministry to
        operate and things operate the angel of the Lord comes near, it’s just a little special way, it’s just
        something between the man and the Lord knows about it. If I explained it you still wouldn’t
        understand it, but it’s just like that and there it is, that’s all. I tell you this, the exact way Brother
        Branham explained it and how he went into that…
         You know I wouldn’t lie to you. I hold my hand right here on the Bible. I told my wife
        exactly how that operated and it is word for word the way Brother Branham told it. I said,
        “Honey if I could just… it’s just like a little gear, like slip the cultch in fourth gear and there it is
        just as plain as day.” And so, help me, Brother Branham told it right back.
        
        5
         So, it is the Lord God descended with a Shout, that ministry was right in the Bible, in Malachi
        4:5, and Luke 17:30.
        Malachi 4:5-6-Reference quote:
        5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of
        the Lord:
        6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their
        fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
        Luke 17:30-Reference quote:
        30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
         The Lord God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the mighty God, comes inside that man by the real true
        Seal of God. He came down in that man and went across the earth and in that Second Pull it
        operated. When the presence of the Lord would come near, he’d wait there a little bit when the
        Lord would come near and just relax a little bit, and then he would see. And what it was, he
        would just yield himself, and he don’t think his thoughts, but that’s the mind of Christ, see.
        That’s the mind of Christ the Word, and that Word looks out there and says, your name is Mary
        Brown you got this and you’re suffering with that. Now he hears that voice speaking and he
        knows that they are his vocal cords speaking, but it is another mind operating it. See, my mind
        operates my voice now. You hear my voice? That’s my vocal cords, that’s what they sound like.
        But now when that supernatural anointing in the Son of Man comes… I hope I don’t get in
        trouble with the Lord, you understand what I’m saying. When that supernatural anointing strikes
        that man, then it’s God’s vocal cords, see. And then He articulates his vocal cords, but the mind
        is the mind of Christ. And that mind of Christ knows who you are, it knows the future, knows
        everything about you. That’s why it’s perfect.
         But notice in the Shout, it did not say who it was! It was hid. Now they thought that was
        Brother Branham saying that. They’d say Brother Branham could you tell me…? He would say,
        no, I couldn’t. I don’t know! I don’t know you, but the Lord knows you. That wasn’t me that was
        the Lord. They still never got it, did they? They never did get it!
         All right now, that was Jehovah God hidden, the mighty God, hidden in human flesh. Now
        notice, He’s hid in human flesh, now that ministry is rejected and put on the outside. Now what
        did they do? I’m trying to get your attention… they turned down their Messiah. The Gentiles
        turned down their Messiah. They have never had a prophet, Son of Man, but they got one in
        Malachi 4:5. Notice that they claim to have had the Lord Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy
        Ghost in them. And then when He come in a man in the form of the Shout, they put him on the
        outside of the churches. That’s right in Revelation the third chapter, Christ, the Shout, was put on
        the outside of the churches. He was knocking, trying to get back in.

        This person that was to come forth, this Message, rather, that was to come forth, was to be like
        Elijah. Elijah was to come three times. Now you say, that, “John the Baptist was that guy.” IF
        YOU NOTICE, JESUS SAID IT WAS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS THE MESSENGER OF
        
        6
        MALACHI 3, NOT MALACHI 4. “BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE MY
        FACE.” I think Matthew 11:6, right down along in there you’ll find it, Matthew the 11th
        chapter. 147 Now, but in this last days, there is to come a Spirit of Elijah amongst the people,
        and he is to do the same thing that they did back there. His nature would be the same thing,
        the nature of the Church. The nature of the—the person would be exactly the same thing.
        AND THAT MESSAGE GOING OUT, TRY…HE WOULD BE HATED, WITH THE
        PEOPLE. He would hate women, ornery ones, anyhow, bad ones. Love the wilderness; moody,
        upset guy all the time, like Elijah was, and like John was. And we’ve seen all this thing come to
        pass. If we have had the Message, we see Christ rejected. You have to belong to one of these
        organizations or you can’t get into them. So, He, He is throwed on the outside. See? CHRIST
        CAN’T WORK AMONG THEM. “What are you?” “A Christian.” “What denomination you
        belong to?” “I don’t belong to any.” “We can’t use you.” 148 See, He’s rejected. Right! See,
        rejected! So was Elijah rejected, and so was John rejected. But, what, did it hurt them? Did it
        hurt their message? They said, “Oh, you stiffnecks.” They poured it on them. They didn’t pull
        any punches. They went right ahead. AND GOD’S MESSAGE WILL MOVE RIGHT ON,
        REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANYBODY SAID, see, till the consummation, and when the…that
        which is determined shall be poured out. And we’re at the end.
         See, they claim to have Him down on the inside. They claimed to have Him tabernacled down
        on the inside by the true Baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of God. And there the Pentecostal
        age here this church put Christ on the outside, which was their Messiah. Now they don’t realize
        that was their Messiah and that was their Shout. Now, notice that they turned down the invitation
        to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb through the Shout.
         Now the next ministry comes on the scene is the Bridegroom himself. Now the Bridegroom is
        coming to bring His Bride to Himself. Now it’s not hid any more, it’s not hid any more. Now the
        Bridegroom is revealed. Now He can reveal himself, because they’ve already turned him down.
        So now He can come forth and reveal Himself by the Bridegroom, the Voice. Ain’t that just as
        simple? Should nobody misunderstand, that’s just as plain as day. Now when those that have
        turned him down, have turned the Shout down and put him on the outside of the churches, then
        when that ministry crosses the earth they’ll run out and sit down right out under that too.
        They’ll sit… now let me show you something. They’ll come and sit right down under that too,
        and then they won’t know it, see. It will be just another man. It’ll be some little ole feller you
        know, but there he’ll be doing great supernatural miracles that’s never been done on the earth.
        See, Gods great vindication. And of course, when that comes, they’ll gravitate to it, everything
        will come to it, you know.

         And they’ll run up there and think they’re gonna be in on that too. But it’s gonna be a
        different picture this time now. They done turned it down, now it’s gonna be wrath on them. It’s
        gonna be wrath and judgement on them. They’ll see those mighty angels being revealed,
        bringing wrath and judgement to them that turned down the invitation to the Marriage Supper of
        the Lamb.
         Now notice here, watch here. Here they sit right in the presence of this great mighty God
        being revealed. Now notice, that it’s not, thus saith the Lord, no more then. You see it’s just
        handed out just like this, see. It’ll tell you… now remember when that comes, and you hear it,
        then you recognize it, and you remember back there what was told you, and you’ll know what
        that is. It won’t say, thus saith the Lord. But it will be the Lord Jesus speaking and He’ll just
        give you what; your heart’s desire. Now, He will identify Himself. He will identify Himself.
         Oh... if you could just see the great vastness of it. I tell ya, if you really get it by a Revelation,
        it’ll just take God to do it. You’ll never figure it out in your mind.
         Now notice here, that they turned down the Messiah and put him on the outside and here all
        these great evangelists, all these great men, friends of that man, see. Friends of that man that God
        used. He was hidden, see. They will now know that was the mighty God hidden and revealed in
        simplicity. And now He comes forth in great power. Great power to manifest Him as the mighty
        Jehovah God, the Messiah, that was turned down. He brings His message there; it all fits perfect

        He came as the Son of man. 69 Then after the Holy Spirit came, He was then the Son of God.
        God is a Spirit. He was the Holy Spirit, Son of God. HE LIVED THROUGH THE CHURCH
        AGES AS SON OF GOD. 70 Now, in the Millennium, He’ll be Son of David, sitting upon the

        PROPHET, FULFILLING THE REST OF IT. See? The Scriptures tie perfectly together. Son
        of man, Son of God, Son of David. What was it? It’s the same God all the time, just changing
        His form, en morphe. He just change it. It’s a great drama to Him. He is acting it out. 72 He
        came as Son of man, the Prophet. Done exactly. Even that little woman in all of her sin, there at

        Jesus said in the last days, or the Scripture speaks, that they’d be “heady, high-minded, lovers
        of pleasure more than lovers of God, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, and despisers
        of those that are good, having a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof. From such,
        turn away.” It was also spoke by our Lord, “These signs will follow them that believe. And to the
        end of the world, in My Name they shall cast out devils, speak with new tongues, and take up
        serpents, or if they drinking deadly things, it wouldn’t harm them. If they lay hands on the sick,
        they shall recover.” 27 Listen, there’s been many false impersonations of that. I’ll admit that.
        There’s been many fanatics went out, but it’s only the devil trying to put a blinder. There’s a
        real genuine Holy Spirit to perform signs and wonders, and it’s the day and the hour has
        arrived. It’s the devil’s business to put out those things. He did it in—before the coming of
        Jesus. Don’t you remember the great talk of Gamaliel, when there was one raised up named
        Justus or Jesus, that led four hundred people out into the wilderness and they all perished? But
        there was coming a real Jesus. AND THE REAL JESUS ARRIVED ON THE SCENE. NO
        MATTER HOW MANY FANATICS COME IN THE FIRST PLACE AND TRYING TO DO
        THIS AND DO THAT TO IMPERSONATE, IT ONLY WAS A SIGNPOST THAT THE
        REAL GENUINE JESUS WAS COMING. THEN WHEN HE COME, THEY RECOGNIZED
        HIM. MANY OF THEM WHO WERE WAITING, THEY RECOGNIZED HIM. And today,
        we’ve had a lot of fanaticism out under the name of this, that, and the other, BUT IT’S ONLY
        BEEN A SIGNPOST TO POINT THAT THE REAL LORD JESUS AND THE REAL HOLY
        GHOST REVIVAL WOULD BE HERE SOON. And we’ve lived in it. We’re in it now. You’re
        setting in it this afternoon. It’s all around you.
         That’s why…How many want to stay in the Word and prayer, so you’ll recognize when He
        comes. That’s why the denominations and all of them are clear out of the picture. It’ll take a
        really elected person that can see the revealed Word of God because He’ll be the revealed Word
        of God. Now, He’ll identify himself.

        Now, listen to me just a moment. Christ is in this building now. Christ is in you just now, you
        believers. Christ was in Joseph, did you see how it made him act? Christ was in Elijah. Christ
        was in David. Look at David, rejected, dethroned with his own people, rejected as king in
        Jerusalem, went up to the mount of Olives and looked back, weeping. Eight hundred years the
        Son of David set on the same mountain, rejected, and wept, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft
        would I have gathered you.” SEE, IT’S CHRIST. 52 NOW, IF IT’S CHRIST IN YOU,
        CHRIST WILL RECOGNIZE CHRIST. “My sheep know My voice; a stranger they will not
        follow.”
         Now, notice this. Now this is real good. Notice that the Shout had to have a Field Manager.
        Why is because it had politics in it. It had to go setup meetings. And then what did it do? He’d
        have to have testimonies. He had to have all kinds of testimonies and go back for years and years
        and years. Is that right? All kinds of testimonies, he had to give testimonies. He had to give all
        kinds of…
         Let me read that, I don’t know how I got on that. Let me look here in John. There’s something
        that’s kinda pressing me right here. And I’d like to…Well, ya. Let’s look here in John 5, and
        read this. That’ll help us understand these angels here it all fits together. Now, let’s read verse
        28. St John 5:28.
        John 5:28-29-Scripture Reading;
        28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear
        his voice,
        29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
        have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
         Now there’s two resurrections there.
        John 5:30-Scripture Reading;
        30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek
        not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.
        “30 I can of mine own self do nothing…”
         Now, who is this speaking? This is the Son of Man, the Bridegroom himself, speaking. Is that
        right? This was His first coming here on earth, when this was wrote down by the apostles. But
        now He’s speaking now of His second coming, which is the coming… not the rapture, but the
        second coming of the Son of Man, which will be the Bridegroom, to gather the Bride unto his
        side.
        
        11
        “… I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I
        seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.”
         Now that has got to come again just exactly like that. Now is He coming with His corporal
        body? No! He’s got to find another yielded body to get into to do that with. But these scriptures
        will be just exactly again in that body that he hides in. Now watch here.
        John 5:31-Scriture Reading;
        31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

        98 And then when Jesus left, He spoke of this dispensation of the Holy Spirit, the Life inside, a
        Witness of Him of the resurrection. I got lots of Scriptures here, but I just haven’t got time to
        get into them, I’ll just brief them over. All right. It’s always been a fact and a—A FIGHT,
        WHEN ONE DISPENSATION IS CHANGING FROM AN OLD DISPENSATION TO A
        PRESENT-TIME MESSAGE, IT’S ALWAYS BEEN A FIGHT WITH THE PEOPLE.
        They—they—they…It’s, although it’s been always Scriptural. But during the time that God gives
        them a dispensation and something to live by, or something to do. Now we find out that
        immediately after that dispensation is given, the men of the earth try to find something to
        counteract that, and something to make a man-made affair of it. 99 After Noah had the ark, and
        then immediately after that, Nimrod, that renegade, he built a tower, and said, “If the floods
        would come, we’ll just climb up and get above it.” And then God come along with the law that
        just…See, that dispensation had lived its time out. 100 And when Jesus came, also, after the
        law, the law spoke of Moses and…spoke of the coming of Christ. But when He came, they was so
        set in the traditions of the fathers, they had their creeds, they had their fashions, they had their
        churches, they were settled down, so it was so hard for Jesus to try to shake that kingdom (that
        church) from a creed, to believe Him. AND YET THE SCRIPTURES ESPECIALLY SPOKE
        OF THIS ONE ALL THE WAY FROM THE FIRST DISPENSATION OF EDEN, “HIS
        SEED SHALL BRUISE THE SERPENT’S HEAD.” Promised Jesus through each one of the
        dispensation, and, WHEN HE COME, THEY DIDN’T RECOGNIZE HIM, because they were
        so bound in their creed. But yet it was the Scriptural truth. Each messenger and its Message
        foretold the other one to follow, each time. Moses, the prophets foretold, Moses foretold of the
        coming of Jesus. Moses said, “The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet like unto me.”
        How many times have we been through that in our Messages around the world, THAT THE
        COMING MESSIAH WAS TO BE A PROPHET!

        71 And, remember, between the Son of God…In the Laodicea church age, they put Him out.
        And in Luke, He said He would be revealed again as Son of man, THE PROPHET,
        FULFILLING THE REST OF IT. SEE? THE SCRIPTURES TIE PERFECTLY
        
        12
        TOGETHER. Son of man, Son of God, Son of David. What was it? It’s the same God all the
        time, just changing His form, en morphe. He just change it. It’s a great drama to Him. He is
        acting it out. 72 He came as Son of man, the Prophet.
         Showing you that when it goes forth to the public that God will bear witness of it. Notice
        there’ll be no Field Manager, there’ll be no setting up, no meetings at all. See, you believe it or
        you don’t! It don’t make no difference to Him, see. God… That’s all over, that days done gone
        by. See, you either believe it or perish.
        John 5:32-Scriptrue Reading;
        32 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth
        of me is true.
         Now watch here!
        John 5:33-Scripture Reading;
        33 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
         “You sent unto John,” Now, “You sent unto John” to get a meeting. Come on now! You sent
        up to John and said, come for a week come here for a week, come over here and hold a meeting
        over here for a week. How many say amen? “You sent unto John,” “You sent unto John,” Right?
        Malachi 4:5. Is that John? Now when he came, he bore witness to the truth, he bore witness to it,
        Right?
        John 5:34-Scritpture Reading;
        34 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
        
         “But I don’t receive testimony from man! But these things I say, that ye might be saved.”
        Now he had… John had to have testimony of man, because they wouldn’t give him another
        meeting. How many say amen, to that? (Amen) He had to have testimony of man and pacify the
        preachers, pacify all that, see. So that he could have testimony of man. Brother Branham is a
        great man of God, we ought to have him in our cities.
         But the ministry of the Bridegroom when He went forth, He won’t have no Field Manager.
        And they didn’t send for Him, He just come. He just come and God bore witness of it and that
        was it. So, you see, we’re in for something different, aren’t we? Altogether different! There’ll be
        no evangelization in this. This is the Bridegroom Himself.
        John 5:34-Scritpture Reading;
        34 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
         He who? John the Baptist, Malachi 4:5, was a burning and shining light. Now he was a
        burning and shining light. He wasn’t the Light, but he was a burning and shining light.
        John 5:35-Scripture Reading;
        35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
        
        13
         Now they only done it for a season, because after that Brother Branham saw a vision that they
        we’re hungry for biscuits and walked away. First it was hundreds of thousands of letters coming
        in every day by the bags and the sacks full, and then you could carry them in, in a little tiny
        paper bag, down to twenty-five down to fifteen letters a day. How many say amen? They were
        willing for a season to rejoice in his light, then they got tired of it. Right?

        288 Now, one thing more. Will you permit it to be said? Day before yesterday morning…You’ll
        notice on the—the board out there, a vision. I had a vision. It was about five o’clock, as my wife
        back there knows, or six. I had woke up. We got up to get the children ready to go to school. 289
        I just have these, now and then. And you all know, every one of you here, that they never fail.
        They, they are absolutely perfect. See? They never fail. 290 And I thought that I was the happiest
        person I ever seen. I was standing in the sun, s-u-n, and was—and was preaching the Gospel to a
        large, mammoth congregation. 291 [Brother Branham pauses—Ed.] I just wanted to see if it was
        being taped. 292 A—a large, mammoth congregation, and they were setting in a forest. And
        streaks of the sun was shining down on them, just here and there, getting It, getting the Word.
        293 And I’m, as usual, always too long, too late, preach too long. And I preached so long, until
        the congregation become hungry for physical food. And they, some of them, got tired. So they
        just got up, went out to get them some food, started going out. I said, “Don’t. Don’t.” 294 I had
        two climaxes I wanted to meet, I wanted to meet, in my sermon. And the Lord had give it to me.
        And any preacher knows, when you really know it’s God has give it to you, you just burning to
        tell the people. 295 And I was just preaching, Charlie, just as hard as I could preach, just laying
        it on, you know, and say, “All these great things, this what God is doing. Look at this. He
        discerns the thoughts of the heart. What is It? The Word.” And go like that. And, oh, I wish I
        could remember what I would say and what my text was. I can’t think of it. See? But I was just
        preaching away. 296 And I was watching myself do it. And then when I was standing there,
        looking, and watching myself preach It. 297 And I was just preaching, to-who-wouldn’t-have-it.
        And after a bit, I raised up, you know, and I thought, “Glory to God!” I said, “Look at these
        wonderful things, and this, that!” 298 Directly, I noticed the people begin to get like they was
        physically hungry. And so they had enough spiritual, so they started walking away. And some of
        them…[Brother Branham yawns—Ed.] Started walking away. I thought, “What’s the matter with
        everybody?” 299 And—and I looked, and here some young couples going along, to my side. I
        thought…I said, “Just a minute, friend! Just a minute! You’ll be back again when the
        evening shadows fall.” See? I said, “You’ll be back again. But let me give you this first climax.
        Where does all these things come from, that I’ve showed you? Where are they from?” I said,
        “Here they are. They are in the Word of God. They are THUS SAITH THE LORD, His
        promise. Cause,” I said, “all of you bear me record, witness this, that my commission is, ‘Stay
        with the Word.’” I said, “What’s the matter with all of you? Can’t you understand the Word?
        You must understand It.” 300 And some of them said, “Man, I’d like to have some biscuits,”
        and so like that. 301 Well, I just thought, “Well, glory to God! If they want biscuits, let them go
        get them.” 302 So I—I turned around. I thought, “Oh, but, you know what? The shadows is
        going to fall, after while, right away.” I said, “Then, tonight, when that congregation gathers in
        
        14
        again, I’ll put the climax to them, and told them that the things that they have seen me do is
        found in the Word of God, not in some mythical book or some organization. It’s found in the
        Word. See? Every bit of it, in the Word, ’cause I’m commissioned to That.” 303 I thought,
        “You know, they’ll, every one, be back tonight, so here is what I’ll do. I’ll background, kind of
        background.” You know the way I do it on these church ages and things, say what I said before.
        “I’ll background it, on the Word, and then this great, marvelous climax.” I said, “What a time
        it’ll be! Praise be to God!” And I seen myself getting real little, and heard that, “Praise be to
        God.” I seen myself fading up like that. And here I was, standing there. 304 Now, here is the
        interpretation thereof. See? The first thing that I have done, the things that’s been done, has been
        mystical to the people, most of them. I don’t mean the Full Gospel and saints of God, but, I
        mean, in most the people. And you never want to look at the world, kosmos, as the Message of
        God. When you go and you say… 305 Like Boze said, “I’ve always…” Said, “I had a dream,
        years ago, that the—the God would send me to Chicago and shake Chicago for the glory of
        God.” I said, “Joseph, He has already done it.” “Why,” he said, “they haven’t been shaken
        since Moody.” 306 I said, “That? I’m talking about the Church. That’s cannon fodder out there.
        That’s just dust of the earth, that bunch cramming through the streets, painted Jezebels and
        everything.” I said, “That’s out there. Them big old lodges and things will crumble and fall into
        the streets there.” I said, “He is talking about the Church. The Church that seen the revelation
        of Jesus Christ made manifest, and they recognize It. They may not be fifteen out of Chicago.
        There may not be ten in this generation, out of the whole city of Chicago, come forth.” 307 Did
        you ever think of that? “As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the Coming of the Son of
        man, wherein eight souls were saved.” Uh-huh. How many come out of Sodom? See what I
        mean? I doubt being a handful. See? 308 But the Church Itself has received the shaking.
        They’ve recognized it. They knowed the Word. They seen the Word when It was being
        materialized, and they caught It. Now look at that for a minute, now. 309 And this first Message,
        when they’d see It, everybody rallied for It, said, “Oh, glory to God! Oh, if I could see this, that,
        and the other.” And they go right away, the same way they come in. See? 310 And now they
        think, “Well, I don’t know. Where would you join? If I don’t come to this, it’ll be this way. And
        I’ll be kicked out, over here, and I won’t have nothing to here.” Brethren set down and say,
        “Well, what would I do if I…?” See there? They won’t stop long enough to recognize It’s the
        Word that God promised, being manifested. See? And they walked away. 311 But, don’t worry,
        the shadows are close at hand, see, when I return to the field. 312 You remember, the other
        night, of the Message that He give me back there when I was laying the corner stone? Just
        exactly. Said, “Do the work…” Said, “When you come out of this vision, read Second Timothy
        4.” You know, it’s laying right there in the cornerstone, thirty-three years ago. 313 Said, “Do
        the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry. For the time will come when they
        will not endure sound Doctrine; but after their own lusts shall heap teachers, having itching
        ears; turn from fable…from Truth unto fables.” If that hasn’t been, just word by word! [Blank
        spot on tape—Ed.] 314 But, remember, then, the other night, when I never did read the rest of it.
        The thirty-something years that I’ve preached in this tabernacle, never one time did I ever go
        any farther than that, and I don’t know why. 315 I often wonder, till, one day, I seen where
        Jesus picked up the Scroll and begin to read, and read half of the prophecy, and stopped, and
        said, there in Capernaum, He said, “And this day, this prophecy is fulfilled.” Why didn’t He
        read the rest of it? It pertains to His second Coming. See?

        that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me TO FINISH.”
        He’s gonna finish up the thing and the rapture takes place and it’s all over. He will wind up
        everything that’s wrote in the Book to be fulfilled, will be fulfilled in the second coming of the
        Lord Jesus.… “which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness

        John 5:38-Scripture Reading;
        38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.

         If they would’ve got the Word from the Shout then they would’ve believed the Voice.
        Because the Shout, wrote and spoke of the Voice that was to follow him.

        21 Soon it shall be “time run out.” Millions will lose their lives. Millions will be, that now
        believe that they are saved, will be counted fodder for the atomic age. We are living at the last
        hour. By the grace of Almighty God, by His help to His people, that they might look forward to
        the soon appearing of Christ! “How long, Brother Branham?” Maybe twenty years; maybe in
        fifty years; maybe in a hundred years. I don’t know. And maybe in the morning; maybe yet
        tonight. I don’t know. And anybody says they do know, they’re wrong. See? They don’t know.
        God, only, knows. 322 Now notice. So help me, by God, I tell the Truth, that These are spiritually
        discerned to me, discerned by the Holy Spirit. And, by every one of Them, has identified Its place
        in the Bible. 323 Now, what this great secret is that lays beneath this Seal, I do not know. I
        don’t know it. I couldn’t make it out. I couldn’t tell It, just what It—just what It said, but I know
        that It was them Seven Thunders uttering themselves right close together, just banging seven
        different times. And It unfolded into something else that I seen. Then, when I seen That, I looked
        for the interpretation. It flew across there, and I couldn’t make It out. That’s exactly right. See?
        The hour isn’t quite yet for It. 324 But, It’s moving into that cycle, see. It’s coming up close. So,
        the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the Name of the Lord. Be prepared,
        for you don’t know what time something can happen. 325 Now, when that gets on tape, which
        It is, that’ll probably send ten thousand of my friends away from me. Cause, they’re going to say,
        that, “Brother Branham is trying to put himself, and make himself, a—a servant or a prophet, or
        something, before God.” Let me tell you, my brethren, that is an error. 326 I’m only telling you
        what I seen and what has been told to me. And now you—you do whatever you want to. I don’t
        know who is going to…what’s going to take place. I do not know. I just know that those Seven
        Thunders holds that mystery. The Heavens was quiet. Everybody understand? [Congregation
        says, “Amen.”—Ed.] IT MAY BE TIME, IT MAY BE THE HOUR NOW, THAT THIS
        GREAT PERSON THAT WE’RE EXPECTING TO RISE ON THE SCENE MAY ARISE ON
        THE SCENE. 327 Maybe this ministry, that I have tried to take people back to the Word, has
        laid a foundation; and if it has, I’ll be leaving you, for good. There won’t be two of us here the
        same time. See? If it is, he’ll increase; I’ll decrease. I don’t know. 328 But I have been
        privileged, by God, to look and see what It was, see, see unfold to that much. Now, that is the
        Truth.

        91 God sent His prophet, John, as His Word had said, promised in Malachi 3, "Behold, I send
        My messenger before My face, to prepare the way." John witnessed the same thing. And we
        find out also, in Isaiah 40:3, that Isaiah said, "There will be a voice of a prophet, one crying in
        the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord.'" See? All those prophecies! And—and look, notice
        quickly, the Scripture identified him. When they said, "Who are you? Are you the Messiah?" He
        said, "I am not." "Are you Jeremiah? The prophets, or one of them? 92 He said, "I am not. But I
        am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, as saith the prophet Isaiah." 93 You think they
        would believe that? No, sir. Why? He didn't come through their church. He wasn't of their… See,
        he went in the wilderness at the age of nine years old, and come out at thirty. His message was
        too great to go through a school of theology; he was the one to introduce the—the Messiah. And
        everybody would be pulling him this way and that way. And God sent him in the wilderness, after
        the death of his father, Zechariah. And he was a priest, but he never followed the line of his

        MY INTENTIONS AND DESIRE, TONIGHT, IS TO AWAKEN THAT CHURCH, AGAIN,
        TO THE COMING OF THE LORD JESUS AT HAND. I have to rebuke it. I have to rebuke sin
        in whatever manner it is. I don’t mean it to anybody’s denomination. I have a Message. 29 Now,
        it’s hard to get in a church for a sponsorship, just as it was with our Lord Jesus, ’cause it’s Him;
        it isn’t me. But as He preached at the first, and healed the sick, raised the dead, and cleansed
        the lepers, and cast out devils, everybody wanted Him. BUT THERE COME A TIME WHERE
        THERE’S A MESSAGE THAT ALWAYS FOLLOWS EVERY SIGN, BECAUSE THE SIGN
        HAS A VOICE.
         That’s why Jesus said, search the scriptures. Of course, today it would be… if He came today,
        He might say it like this… I don’t say that he will, but might say. I don’t say He would say that,
        but I’m just sayin what the Word says. It looks like the way He would say it. It would be a little
        different language cause were Americans you know and were living here and talk like we talk.
        He’ll say something like this: “Search the tapes, search the books in them you think you have the
        token, eternal life, and they are they that testify of me.”
        John 5:39-Reference quote:
        39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which
        testify of me.
         They would say something like this: “Well, we got Brother Branham and we follow Brother
        Branham”.
         The response would have been something like this: “If you were Brother Branham’s followers
        you would love me. For because I proceeded forth and came forth from his ministry. His ministry
        laid a foundation for this one. I know that you don’t love me, I know you’re not my disciples
        because His Word, my Word hath no place in you. And him whom God has sent you believe not.”
        
        21
        John 5:38-Reference quote:
        38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
         They would probably say, “Yea, but we are disciples of that prophet, William Branham.”
        He would say,” God is able to raise these stones to raise children to this revelation.”
        Matthew 3:9-Reference quote:
        9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you,
        that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
         Now watch, 39.
        John 5:39-Scripture Reading;
        39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which
        testify of me.
        Search the tapes search the books, search the Bible in them you think… “…ye have eternal life:
        and they are they which testify of me.”
        John 5:40-Scripture Reading;
        40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
         “40 And ye will not come to me…” The Bridegroom the Voice.“ that ye might have…”
        the baptism of the Holy Spirit, eternal Life the token. You won’t come to me that you may have
        life.
         Said, “I don’t receive honour of man.”
        John 5:41-45-Scripture Reading;
        41 I receive not honour from men.
        42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
        43 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own
        name, him ye will receive.
        44 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that
        cometh from God only?
        45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses,
        [the prophet] in whom ye trust.
        46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.
         Is that right? well, we could be forever on that!
         But now showing you that this shout the mighty God hidden and revealed in human flesh in
        this Shout. Later He is to be manifested in great power and great glory in the Voice.
         But then, by that time, the Pentecostal denomination has done turned down their Messiah, put
        him out on the outside. They don’t know that now. They’re not gonna know that until this Voice
        speaks across the earth, then they’ll know it. Now when this Voice crosses the earth, when this
        Voice ministry crosses the earth, they’ll…that group will have already turned down the Messiah
        and have blasphemed themselves away from eternal life. They won’t know that, see. They’ll
        
        22
        think they are saved and filled with the Holy spirit and think everything’s alright, until this
        ministry comes on the scene.
         Now notice here, over in John, in Matthew, in the gospels, it went on and said, in that day
        they’d say, when they come before the Voice the Bridegroom, the Son of Man, when they come
        before him see in his ministry there… Now that ain’t up in heaven, that’s down here on earth.
        And they come before this Son of Man, the Bridegroom, the Voice and then this Voice reaches
        out and brings judgement upon them. Judgement on them because they have turned down the
        ministry of the Shout, the Messiah. They have turned down the Messiah, now the Voice brings
        judgement upon them. “Why did you not believe my servant John? Whence cometh John was he
        of man or was he of denominations? Whence cometh him? Did he come out of the
        denominations? Did the denominations man send him, or did he come from God?”
        John 7:27-29-Reference quote:
        27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence
        he is.
        28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I
        am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
        29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
         Now all man know that William Branham was a prophet of God. Right? So, he’s gonna put
        that on them. “Well, if you believe he come from God, then why did you not believe his Word?”
        So, the Voice brings judgement and wrath upon them. Right!
         And now, they go to pieces. Because this revealed Word children, is gonna lick up everything
        that’s on the field. They’re not gonna be able to stay with the false churches and the
        denominations is gonna run out all together when this ministry crosses the earth. Because there’s
        gonna be such power! But didn’t it shake the earth when Brother Branham came? Now, when
        this comes, that’ll be the end of Jannes and Jambres, they’ll have no more place to stand. And, so
        will all the other great ministers and the great papers, their great books, and everything.
         Now I know what I’m talking about! I’m speaking on prophecy, this is prophecy. And then
        they’ll run up there in the presence of that man. Maybe he’ll have tent. I don’t know nothing
        about that. All I know is that it’ll be there. Now whether it’ll be in a tent, or how it’ll be, it could
        be, it could very well be out there because it won’t go into this little church and that little church
        because it’s gonna be a great thing. A very, very great thing!
         And so, they’ll run there. The supernatural is still the greatest drawing act of power. Right?
        So, when they come up there and run up there right in the face of this man… probably God will
        probably use a little ole fella, maybe it won’t be a great handsome guy, it’ll be some little
        insignificant fella that can’t… don’t sound much like a preacher, but he’ll be the revealed Word
        of God. And there they’ll run up there, they won’t think nothing, they won’t know, they’ll just
        think everything is just wonderful, and then they’ll run into something they’ve never run into
        before! They’ll run right into the face of a Lion. Not a lamb no more, but a Lion, mad and angry
        and ripping, and tearing.
         Friend, I believe a most fearful thing that’s ever strike the earth. And they’ll run right up there
        and run right into the wrath of God hidden behind a human being. And they’ll think that man is
        totally insane, but he’ll have such great power that they can’t get away from it. And when they
        run up there they will know they can’t get away from that power, because no man has ever done
        
        23
        such miracles, and has such authority. Create arms and legs and limbs and everything, speak the
        Word, that is the Voice.

        it’s real, real close. I may be building a platform for somebody else to step on. I may be taken
        before that time. I don’t know. And that time may be this coming week, that the Holy Spirit will

        don’t know when He will come. He doesn’t tell us that. 51 But I do believe, that we are so close,
        that I would never die with old age. Yet, at fifty-four years old, I’ll never die with old age, until
        He’s here. See? Unless I’m shot, killed, or something other, some way killed, just old age
        wouldn’t kill me, until He’s come. And I believe that. 52 And I want to say this. I’ve never said it

        before. But according to Scripture, according to what He said thirty years ago; thirty-three years
        ago on the river down there, in 1933, rather; what He said, everything has happened just
        exactly. I MAY NOT DO IT, BUT THIS MESSAGE WILL INTRODUCE JESUS CHRIST
        TO THE WORLD. FOR, “AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS SENT TO FORERUN THE
        FIRST COMING, SO IS THE MESSAGE TO FORERUN THE SECOND COMING.” AND
        JOHN SAID, “BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE
        WORLD.” SEE? SO, IT’S, IT PARALLELED IT IN EVERY WAY. And I know it will, the
        Message will go on.
         Now notice, it will be so great and so tremendous and the Word will be such a Revelation
        with such clarity, that it will make them realize that they have turned down their Messiah.
         So, watch this scripture come to life now! And then Jesus said in that day when the Son of
        Man comes again, and they’ll say, “But Lord!” There He is! “Lord! Lord! But Lord we have ate
        and drank in thy presence.”
        Matthew 7:22-23-Reference quote:
        22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
        name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
        23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
         When did they ever eat and drink in his presence? They must realize that the same ministry
        that Brother Branham had is the same ministry that broke out again and only greater. And they
        realize that they had sat in the presence, on the platform in the meetings where that angel was
        ministering with that prophet. And they recognize that Voice speaking up out of Him, God in
        human flesh. They will come to life then.
         Before He was hid but now He just speaks out. When He calls somebody, or something like
        that, judgement or whatever it is, and says “this is the Lord Christ speaking. This ain’t this man,
        this is the Lord Jesus speaking. You’re this, you done that, you committed adultery, you done
        this the other night. Deny it, and I’ll strike you dead right where you’re standing.” This brings
        great judgement and things like that, see. And they can’t run from that.
         And so, what do they do? They cry out for mercy. And the preacher cries out like this you
        know, “Now, look here, Lord, you know me, I’m T.L., or… I’m O.R.… Lord, I come out, I ate
        in your presence. I drank in your presence.”
         And then what does He say? “Depart from me you workers of iniquity, I NEVER DID
        KNOW YOU!”
         Now that ain’t at the White Throne Judgement, that ain’t up in heaven. That’s got to take
        place here on earth.
         “Now, oh Lord, wait a minute, Lord. I cast out devils, I healed the sick, Oh God, I had great
        meetings and I raised the dead Lord. Oh, please Lord don’t turn me away from this!” “Depart
        from me you workers of iniquity, I never did know you.” “But Lord you know me, my name is…
        Lord I had this great meeting, I got witnesses. I had thousands saved.” “Depart from me you
        worker of iniquity I never did know you”.
         And they’ll be cast out into the tribulation where there’s weeping and wailing and gnashing of
        teeth. Boy, it just trembles my heart to even talk about that. How many believe that with all your
        heart? (Amen)
        
        25
         Friend, I tell ya if it wasn’t for the grace of God, I’d just lose my mind, knowing and seeing
        all these things. And years ago, I thought all that was up in heaven back there. And here it is
        ready to take place, and here’s preachers going on preaching and don’t know it but they are ready
        to run right into the face of the Lord God Himself. That’s right. Talking about God’s prophet any
        way they want to, blaspheming him, talking about the message of God, running him dogging him
        crucifying him. But remember He’s got two hundred, three hundred and sixty some thousand
        converts in the assemblies of God alone. Hundreds of thousands in United Pentecostal, Baptist,
        Methodist, Presbyterian and thousands in independent churches and thousands of them all
        around the world. And that Third Pull, the Voice of the Bridegroom Himself, the Son of Man is
        going out there and bring them out of there.
         Now, we see the coming of the Lord with his mighty Angels. The Third Pull was Angels, not
        little birds but Angels. The Angels of heaven coming, bringing the Kingdom of Heaven to the
        elected Bride of Christ.
         Now let’s look over in Hebrews.
         Children one day when all them things will come to pass and you’ll look back and then you’ll
        really be able to comprehend it then. Is it scriptural? (Amen) It’s the promise of the hour. The
        Lord himself…
         I tell ya what, if the conditions are so bad and the devil is so powerful, and things are going so
        contrary, that I’m glad He said, “The Lord Himself, He’ll do it.” Because there is no man able to
        do this thing. I believe man… Shows you right there that man is clear out of the picture, clear out
        of the picture. Like the Angel of the Lord told Brother Branham, “If your sincere this will come
        to pass.”
         He told Brother Branham not to get his line tangled up in these kind of times. Shows you that
        man whoever God uses or where ever he’s at, that man will have to be alone. He’ll have to come
        to a place where he’s so yielded to the Lord Jesus, just so close to the Lord, he’ll just stay right in
        the Word till he becomes the Word. He’ll stay right in there till he becomes the Word.

        William M Branham
        122 And I was pulling the line, like this, and I was trying to straighten my line out. And He
        looked at me, said, “Now, don’t get your line tangled up, in these kind of times.”
         There’ll come an hour when that spirit will fall on him like it did on Jesus, and there’ll he’ll
        start his ministry. He was still the revealed Word when He was in the carpenter shop. He was
        still that revealed Word…
         Now hold it there, now wait just a minute! You see, now he never sent Jesus, He never sent
        Jesus, the first time out to meet the public until He became the full body revealed Word. Now
        notice, He don’t go forth with just half of the Word and then go home and rest for a while, and
        then learn some more. When His ministry started brother, He was the Bible manifested. And
        when this ministry goes forth today, it won’t go out there and learn a little bit and go home, and
        wait two or three months then study some more get some more word go back out on the field a
        little bit, then come back. No sir brother, when it starts it’ll be the total body full body revealed
        Word crossing the earth. How many believe that?
        
        26
         Now, I wanna look again… I got way off my subject this morning, but that was the Lord that
        done that. But we’ll try to bring out a few things that you can see. You already can see this Third
        Pull is Angels. You can see that much, don’t you? Who do I believe the captain of those angels
        is? It is Michael. Michael the great archangel coming leading the Angels from heaven to minister
        to the heirs, heirs of salvation. Those believers, that elected Bride, that’s gonna come into the
        body of Christ. Those angels are coming to minister to each one of them. Every one of them
        children will have an Angel. Ain’t that wonderful? Each one of you will have a ministering
        Angel. And whatever supernatural thing that God uses you for, it’ll be that Angel standing there
        doing it for you. Now you know you couldn’t do nothing, could you? It’ll have to be Him doing
        it for you, see. Ain’t that wonderful?
         Now, let’s read our scriptures over here, where we’ve been bringing out, what God has been
        giving us for about six months. About… How many love Mount Zion! Mount Zion is the
        spiritual Bride. Of course, we know that Zion, the new city new Jerusalem, comes down out of
        heaven from God at the end of the thousand years, after the thousand-year millennium. But
        Mount Zion is spiritual Zion today, and is the true first church, Bride church, the free born, and
        that’s the elected Bride. Now let’s look here just a minute on these angels.
        Hebrews 12:22-24-Scripture Reading;
        22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
        Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
        23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God
        the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
        24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh
        better things than that of Abel.
        Hebrews 12:22-24-Ad Lib;
        “22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God.” Spiritual city, see…
        “… the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels.” Now, here’s where
        you’ll find these innumerable company of angels.“23 To the general assembly and church of the
        firstborn, which are written in heaven,” There’s your elected Bride.
        “… and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of Justified men made mature men made…
        Mature. “perfect.” “24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant…”
         Showing you that here is the new Bride covenant coming into existence to the Bride. The
        church ages are over now, then you’re in a new day. How many say amen to that! You’re in a
        new day, you’re under a new covenant. Now the plan to the blood was lost during the church
        ages but it’s been restored again by the revealed Word of God, the plan to the Blood so we can
        enter into the new covenant. Isn’t it gonna be wonderful when you receive your covenant?

        61-0112 - Questions And Answers
        William Marrion Branham
        2 Now notice this, now, that star rose in the east. Is that right? It was a great star. All right. And
        who was the actual earthly star in the time of the coming of Jesus? Why, JOHN. He was the
        one who guided them to that perfect Light. Is that right? That was in the east at the first
        appearing of Jesus. And, now, there’s a lot of little stars that cross over the horizontal until it
        
        27
        comes over to the evening star. 403 And the evening star shines in the evening. The morning
        star shines in the morning. And they’re both the same size stars and the same kind of star.
        Now put two and two together and you got it, see. See, there you are. So it isn’t…The star isn’t
        Messiah, he’s just reflecting the Messiah. 404 Now, the star does not reflect its own light. The
        star reflects the light of the sun. Is that right? [A brother says, “No.”—Ed.] Huh? [“In a sense.
        The moon does; the stars reflect their own light.”] Yeah. Yeah, the moon, yeah, re-…I mean that
        the moon reflects this light. Yeah, Uh-hum. Now, if—if a star reflecting its light, then its light
        would have to come from the…from God, because it is a glacier of some sort. Isn’t it? [The
        brother says, “Sun.”] Huh? A sun of itself, off of the sun. [“The suns farther away than our
        sun.”] Yeah. And they…We’re told that those suns come from the big sun. The sun throwed these
        missiles off and they’re little burning missiles like the sun. So they’re amateur suns to us. Is that
        right? Amateur lights. [“Some are…most of them are bigger than our sun.”] I mean to us, to us,
        see. We’re talking about ourselves here. All right. 405 Now, if they are suns to us, or lightgivers, they are part of the main giver. See? The big sun gives us the big light, the perfect light.
        The little suns, or the little stars, which we can see in bodies, they may be far beyond the—the
        sun that shines, but what they reflect to us is a smaller light. But they’re only giving witness of a
        light. Is that right? Then when the big sun rises, the little suns go out. Is that right? They’re not
        the—the sun to us, they are a reflector like the sun. See what I mean? 406 Now, the biggest
        among them (in the morning) that heralds the coming of the sun, the setting of the sun and
        the coming of the sun, is the morning star and the evening star. Is that right? Two of the
        biggest stars, the eastern star and the western star. 407 Now, now you see where it’s at?
        ELIJAH WAS THE MESSENGER TO HAIL, HERALD THE COMING OF THE EASTERN
        STAR, and predicted to be the heralder of the—the western star, OR THE COMING AGAIN
        OF THE NEW DAY AFTER THIS DAY IS PAST. Now you see what it is? 408 The east, “It
        shall be light in the…” See, JUST BEFORE THE SUN WAS HERALDED TO THE EARTH,
        THE MORNING STAR GIVE WITNESS THAT “THE SUN’S COMING.” Is that right? See,
        that brings forth the morning star. Well, then the morning star and the evening star are the
        same type of stars, and there’s little stars all across. Don’t you see what I mean? THE
        MESSENGERS.
         Now, see it’s the law! God set it up by laws. Now if you want to get water you got to work to
        the laws of water. There is a certain way to get water, you got to work with that law. Now if you
        want electricity you got to work to the law of electricity in your house, right? You work to that
        law, God set certain laws.
         Now God has a law and He swore by His law. He sealed it by His blood, and He entered into
        a covenant with the elected Bride, His wife that He’s gonna marry, the Bride of Christ. He enters
        into a covenant with her. And when He gives her His covenant, His seal to His covenant, then
        she has a legal right to ask anything in his name and it’s done.
         That’s why she’ll get one hundred percent answers to prayer. That why she’ll get every
        heart’s desire she’s got; it will be given to her. Because anything she asks in His name… because
        she gets His name. Now if your spiritual you already… Before I preached that message, so you
        already ought to have got it right there.
         There’s where’s your new name’s layin at! How many here you don’t know the revelation of
        the name of Jesus? Let me see your hands. you don’t know it do you? Right? Anybody know the
        revelation of the name of Jesus? No! It’s not known. Nobody knows it. But now when you come
        
        28
        into the body your husband, don’t you take on your husband’s name? So, when you come into
        Christ you come into His name. Ya, I see some of you smiling, its dawning upon you. All right
        now, you take on your husband’s name and you lose your name don’t you, and you take on
        another name. I see some of you smiling, it’s dawning upon you.
         How many want to come into His side? Alright now, you take on your husband’s name and
        you lose your name, don’t you? And you take on another name. Alright, you enter into a
        covenant and this covenant spoken here. “Jesus is the mediator of the new covenant the new
        covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.”
        Hebrews 12:24-Scripture Reading;
        24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh
        better things than that of Abel.
         Now watch here!
        Hebrews 12:25-Scripture Reading; “25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake
        on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:”
         Now notice here, alright now here we have Mount Zion and in Mount Zion we have
        innumerable company of angels, and in Mount Zion we have a new covenant and in Mount Zion
        we have only an elected people who have their names written on the Lamb’s Book of Life slain
        before the foundation of the world.
         Now in Pentecost we used to say, oh glory to God he got saved tonight and got his name
        wrote down in the book of life. There’s no such thing. If your ever gonna be saved, you have to
        have your name on the Lambs Book of Life before the foundation of the world.
         That’s the scripture: Revelation 13:8, Revelation 17:8.
        Revelation 13:8-Reference quote:
        8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book
        of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
        Revelation 17:8-Reference quote:
        8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go
        into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in
        the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not,
        and yet is.
        The Bible said that all who had their names written in the Lamb’s Book of Life slain from the
        foundation of the world, you come unto Mount Zion. When you find Mount Zion your gonna
        find an innumerable company of Angels.
        Hebrews 12:22-Reference quote:
        22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
        Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
        
        29
         Showing you that when you find Mount Zion you won’t find it until the Third Pull is here,
        which is the revealed Word of God. And when you find the revealed Word of God you find
        Mount Zion. Is that right? Angels descending and ascending and the Lord God speaking at the
        top of the ladder. Then you find a new covenant that you’re entering into. You find the eagles;
        those that have their names written on the Lamb’s Book of Life. And now it goes down here.
        Hebrews 12:25,26-Scripture Reading; “25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake
        on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
        26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, yet once more I shake
        not the earth only, but also heaven.”
         Now watch here now! Now notice the earth was shook by a Voice. The earth… talking about
        Mount Zion here. There is a Voice here that shook the earth.
         Now, I certainly believe with all my heart that there is only one ministry that I’ve seen rise in
        the generation I’m living in, that shook the earth. And I do know that from reading the history of
        Brother William Branham’s ministry, that it shook United States. It shook the government of
        United States The picture of the Angel of the Lord hangs in Washington, D.C. FBI men were
        saved and senators and all kinds of great men and kings of the earth were healed and
        miraculously delivered. He shook Finland, He shook Switzerland, He shook Africa. Africa has
        never recovered from Brother Branham coming there. He shook Germany, made headlines all
        over Germany in the biggest papers there. Great renowned men with cameras took the picture
        there with the Angel of the Lord with Brother Branham. He shook Finland, He shook all them
        great countries of the world.
         And that was the Voice that was speakin on earth. That was an earthy messenger Voice
        speakin on earth it shook the earth. Now he said, “See that you refuse him not that speaks on
        earth.” See! Don’t you refuse that Voice that speaks on earth. See, he shook the earth, he shook
        the earth.
         Now watch here. We’re getting to this right here, where I want to get to. But now here’s a
        prophecy, yet once more, one more time Lord, once more Lord, one more time. Now he’s not
        just gonna shake earth now. But He is gonna shake the earth, but not just the earth. Now, he’s
        gonna shake the earth once more and then on top of that he’s gonna shake heaven. Now what is it
        that’s gonna shake in heaven? Is that gonna shake all the stars, and the moon out of place and fall
        to the earth? What is it? There has got to be something there that’s got a little Revelation to it,
        see. Now He’s gonna shake the earth again and He’s gonna shake heaven also.
         Now notice here, going back over our tape we been preaching on The Two Kingdoms. How
        many remember where Satan’s seat was at? How many remember where he’s at? Somebody tell
        me class? In Heaven?
         And we wrestle not… Ephesians Six said, “We wrestle not with flesh and blood but we
        wrestle with principalities and powers in heavenly places.” Showing you that the devil, Satan,
        Lucifer, is a person. The devil, Lucifer, that ole devil, that red dragon, that dragon, that serpent
        Lucifer, called the devil, his throne is in the heavens on the side of the north, and he is the King
        of an army of demons. Literal demons. We have pictures of demons that’s been taken by
        photograph. How many have you seen it? Now we don’t have a known picture of the devil
        himself, but he must be a terrible fella.
        
        30
        Ephesians 6:12-Reference quote:
        12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
        against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
         Now notice when Brother Branham God had given him power to loose and bind that biggest
        devil. More than likely it was Lucifer himself, I don’t know. But anyway, after that, Brother
        Branham laying in his bed one morning, real early in the morning, he felt an awful spirit in the
        room and he opened his eyes and there at the foot of his bed stood great monstrous devil. He said
        he was colored like a black man with a beard a terrible lookin fella and he spoke with a voice he
        had a voice and he spoke and said, “William Branham you don’t have any power with God.”
        Now that devil knew that Brother Branham had just got that Revelation from God to loose and
        bind. Now you know where I have taught in the Word of God and proved by that vision, and
        proved by the Word of God that, that is the apostolic power returning back to the earth again.
        That’s, that White Horse Rider, as sure as the world! Apostolic power, pure Word and power that
        fell on the day of Pentecost to go with it. And the devil come to try to bluff Brother Branham on
        that, and Brother Branham told Brother Don Ruddell. Said, “I just slipped down underneath the
        covers and covered up my eyes cause I was so scared. And he said again, “William Branham you
        don’t have no power with God.” And he raised his eyes up and I said, “Satan in the name of the
        Lord Jesus I rebuke you.” And just a puff and he was gone.

        William Marrion Branham
        329 About two or three months ago, I was standing in the room. I heard a voice speaking in the
        corner. I tried to wake my wife, to look at it there. There, it’s been going before there, was a
        hideous thing standing there at the bed, accusing me. After He had told me…I had seen a big
        mamba running. That’s an African snake, and he was trying to kill people, and was after my
        brother. And I screamed out, “O God, what can I do?” 330 He said, “You been given power to
        bind him.” Said “Be of a good courage.” 331 I spoke to him. And his tail went up in the air, and
        whirled around, and, just like this pitcher handle here, and choked hisself to death. Blue smoke
        flew out of him. 332 Next morning, when I woke up, I was laying there. I said, “I better get up
        and take the children to school.” I looked over, and there was this hideous looking thing. Looked
        like it was Alley Oop in the funny paper, great big horns sticking out of it. He was going,
        sounded like a hen cackling, or—or singing, like they’re going from the barn. I looked at it. I
        said, “Meda, Meda, honey.” And she didn’t wake up. 333 I thought, “Yeah, that’d scare her to
        death.” I waited there just a minute, and stand and watch. 334 People talk about devils, and
        don’t even know what they are, sometime. That’s right. But you run headlong into them, every
        day, maybe, but you will. Notice. 335 And after while, he was accusing me. Said, “You have no
        power with God. You’re just a bluff. You have no power.” 336 I said, “Satan, you’re an offense
        to me. Get out of my way, in the Name of Jesus Christ.” And he left. 337 I laid there a little bit, in
        the bed. Started to raise up, I felt a real sweet feeling come over me. I thought, “Wonder if the
        Holy Spirit now is close?” And over in the corner…So help me, here is my Bible over my heart.
        The sweetest Voice I ever heard in my life, said, “Don’t fear to go anywhere, and don’t fear to
        do anything, for the never-failing Presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go.” 338
        That settled it, with me. Let them rage. I got an Absolute. My anchor holds yonder, because it’s
        
        31
        the Word of the living God. Amen. Yeah.
         Then again, the devil, or one of his demons, appeared in Brother Branham’s home out in
        Tucson. I don’t think this is on tape, but I was out in Tuscan…Ya I think it is on tape, where that
        devil come in Brother Branham’s study while he was praying there and the devil appeared right
        there, didn’t talk but stood right there lookin at him. And Brother Branham said, “Mede come
        here I want to show you something. Mede hurry!” And the devil didn’t want him to call his wife
        and before she could get in there, the devil disappeared. So, friend believe you me, I believe
        there’s a real live Lucifer, Satan, the devil, he’s a person.
         But now get this, the devil is not omnipresent He has a power but it is a perverted power. He
        is not a creator and he cannot heal, he cannot create, but he does not have a corporal body, but he
        has a spiritual form. Right? He’s not omnipresent, he can’t be here in Connecticut and down in
        Georgia at the same time. Now if Lucifer is here in this building tonight, he cannot be down to
        Brother Ruddell’s tonight too. But if he’s here, we’re in for trouble. How many say amen! He’s a
        trouble maker. There’s nothing good about him. And if he’s here, he’ll tell a lie as sure as the
        world. Now, notice he’s one person, and can only be in one place at one time, so more than
        likely Lucifer stays on his throne in heaven. And from heaven he distributes his orders to his
        army of demons. Now of course if there was a great theologian here, he’d laugh at that. Ha! Ha!
        They can all just explain it away, they can explain it all away, you know.
         But I like to take it just like the Bible said, it said, “Lucifer, the devil.”
        Revelation 12:9-Reference quote:
        9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which
        deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
         And they got big words for epileptic but Jesus called it a devil! I don’t care what scientists
        wants to call it, Jesus called it a devil and he cast the devil out. Cast that devil out. Showing you
        that Lucifer, that person Lucifer, Satan called the devil dragon, has headquarters in heaven. And
        from heaven… now you say what heaven is that? That I believe, that is the lower atmosphere. I
        believe that right around this other dimension that we go into the heavens there on the outside of
        that, right there before you enter into the glorious place of the redeemed going to those heavens
        there, where those church age saints are waiting there. I believe that there is Lucifer, the devil, a
        person, the devil sitting on his throne, see.
         Remember how I placed Satan’s church and all that! See, I can’t go back over it and
        background it, now just put that all in there.
         Now he said, “once more God will not only shake the earth again, the whole nations of the
        earth. But He will also shake heaven. Now watch here.
        Hebrews 12:27-Scripture Reading;
        27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of
        things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
        28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we
        may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
        
        32
         “Signifying the removing of those things that are shaken…” He’s going to remove those
        things that can be shaken. … as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken
        may remain.” Showing you there’s one thing that can’t be shaken. Let’s see what it is.
        “28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom...”
         Showing you that this whole thing is tied up with innumerable company of Angels, the Third
        Pull, the revealed Word of God, the Voice of the Bridegroom, the coming of another apostolic
        out pouring of the Holy Ghost, is all tied up with this thing right here were preaching about.
         But everything in heaven and in earth will be shaken and there’s only one thing that’s not
        going to be shook, and it is the redeemed who has come into the true church, the true body of the
        Lord Jesus Christ!
         Now he said, “Wherefore we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.
        Brother and sister if you really believed this that you’re hearing here, you certainly ought to
        reverence God with godly fear.
         But of course, if your pastor is all stirred up and he’s just preaching just to feather his nest
        with your tithes, building himself a nice little house down here and get as many as he can to
        coming in. Ge a little a…We don’t have one, do we? How many we had in Sunday school, see. if
        we could get…
         Oh, Brother Graybill I never did do it. Honestly, I never did, I never did like them charts. I
        never did like… in fact I’ve been a black sheep ever since I was born. I never agreed with
        nothing in Pentecost. All that thing, I never agreed with. But we’re not just all excited and yet we
        are and just emotionally worked up blowing our whistle and hollering and carrying on. But know
        what we’re talking about, this is reality.
         God is gonna have a Bride, and the Kingdom of Heaven has been coming. It’s been coming
        from the negative to the positive. Is that right? And we’re right up here now, when the gates are
        gonna be thrown open wide for the little elected believers that’s standing in love, waiting for the
        promise of the Bridegroom to come, they’re gonna enter into that great thing. So, let us serve
        Him with fear and reverence.

        62-0624 - Super Sign
        William Marrion Branham
        66 Now, that super sign was a virgin-born Child that was to last forever, an eternal Sign. And
        that Child is not dead. He… They killed Him. He died, certainly. The stinger of death killed
        Him, but God raised Him up again. And here He is after two thousand years of all the
        hardships, and locusts, and palmerworms eating on it. THERE IS STILL A REMNANT OF
        PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE GOD AND KEEP HIS WORD. THERE'LL BE A BRIDE. JUST
        AS CERTAIN AS I'M STANDING IN THIS PULPIT; THERE'LL BE A BRIDE THAT'S
        WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF THAT LAMB. And that Lamb will be living among them,
        showing super signs of His resurrection, after two thousand years the same thing He did when
        He was here on earth. I believe that. Amen.
         Now notice here, all things are to be shaken.
         Now to show ya that this is Michael… I believe it’s Michael, that is leading the host of
        heavenly Angels coming to the Bride. I really believe. At first, I kinda thought it might be
        
        33
        Gabriel, but yet I believe Gabriel may have something to do with the resurrection somehow, now
        it could be. How I don’t know. See, we’ll have to wait a little later to get something on that. But I
        do remember Brother Branham said that the Angel that was with him, and we have the picture of
        what was a minor Angel. It wasn’t Gabriel, but it was a minor angel.
         Brother if that was a minor angel that shook the world, I don’t have no mind to comprehend
        what will happen when Michael gets here. Maybe he’s here tonight. I don’t know! But any way
        let’s say it this way when Michael begins to move. I wish he’d start tonight. I tell you one thing
        I’m sure glad I’m on his side. Michael Dear, if you’re listening, we’re on your side, we’re on
        your side we sure are and we certainly believe Michael that the kingdoms of this world is ready
        to crumble at your hand. Amen!

        51-0506A - Believest Thou This?
        William Marrion Branham
        33 Said, a while ago, some of them said something about Peter on the day of Pentecost. Well,
        listen. I’ve been along these Holy Ghost meetings now for some five years. And Peter said on the
        day of Pentecost, “This is that.” And if this ain’t that, I’m going to keep this till that comes. I’ll
        tell you that. You can criticize it, say what you want to, but I believe it’s the real old fashion
        baptism of the Holy Ghost just exactly like it was on the day of Pentecost. Amen. 34 Oh my, I
        can see our Master when He come with that blackness behind Him and saying: that He was an
        illegitimate child. But God sent a warning always before the coming. He sent a man by the
        name of—of John the Baptist. He was a great forerunner of Jesus. God always sends a
        forerunning before some great event. Whenever you see angels will come to the earth… For
        instance, maybe the Angel that deals with God’s humble servant here. That’s a minor, no
        doubt, Angel of healing, or something. Or the Spirit of some great something that’s—that’s
        here, one of God’s attributes. I do not know Who He is. But when you hear of Gabriel coming to
        the earth, something’s going to happen then. Gabriel announced the first coming of Jesus, and
        He will announce the second coming of Jesus. Gabriel, the great Archangel Who stands in the
        Presence of His Majesty… How marvelous.
        
         I believe, as the Psalm said, “Oh, that the mountains would melt at the presence and at thy
        Voice, as I would come down and rend the heavens that the mountains may move, and thy
        presence, and thy Voice.”
        Isaiah 64:1-Reference quote:
        1
        Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains
        might flow down at thy presence,
        2 As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to
        thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!
        3 When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains
        flowed down at thy presence.
        4 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath
        the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
        
        34
         Now we see here, that it is Lucifer himself and his host of demons that is gonna be shook in
        the heavens. Now what is he doing? Brother Michael and his heavenly host of innumerable of
        angels are coming to give out the inheritance to the Bride of Christ and she is getting ready to
        shake up the devil. She’s getting ready to shake this thing.
         Well, I think it’s about time, don’t you? (Amen) Brother, we’ve been on the deep end so long
        knocking off blows, but brother we’re getting ready to chase him now! The battle is gonna turn
        right shortly when Michael gets here. And they that be with us are more than they that be with
        them.
         Now notice over in Jude 8th verse, you’ll see Michael here. And remember our scripture this
        morning from Daniel. You still remember, that one, don’t you? (Amen) “Oh, Daniel, Michael
        shall come that great archangel and he shall stand and all that’s written in the book shall be
        delivered when he comes.”
        Daniel 12:1-Reference quote:
        1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy
        people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to
        that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found
        written in the book.
         Oh Brother! I tell you my heart is just wrapped around that in love to think that I could be
        living to see this glorious thing that’s gonna take place.
         Children ain’t it… how many churches been starved for some preacher to get up and
        enthusiastic and excited and get you all stirred up, and then next thing he’s gone.
         I’m so thankful Brother Arthur Graybill said, “I thought I was born again over here in the
        Mennonites come over here and I went to this one and boy, I got in there, and had to get
        something else, then I got out of there and I went over there and I thought I had it. Helped build
        this church up and build that church up and I come up here and here’s something else.
         Well, I think God there’s an end somewhere, you keep seeking, seeking, seeking you finally
        find it! Cause, He said, seek and ye shall find. And then when you seek and find it, then knock
        and it…
        Luke 11:9-10-Reference Scripture:
        9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall
        be opened unto you.
        10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it
        shall be opened.
        Here it goes now, Boy, I tell you the whole Bible is living! I can’t quote a scripture that I don’t
        get a Revelation. Seek! You got to seek it, then you’ll find it. And when you find it, knock and
        I’ll open it to you. Oh, that’s just wonderful!
         Now notice here Michael, I believe is the one and who is the leader to all the innumerable
        company of angels, coming to minister to the Bride.
        Jude 1:8,9-Scripture Reading;
        8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of
        dignities.
        
        35
        9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending [Contentending means to fight] with the devil he
        disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The
        Lord rebuke thee.” [Devil!] Amen.
         Looks like to me, they got in a big fuss where… Michael came down with his Angels and hid
        Moses. Lucifer, the devil, got mad about it. You know that old devil he likes your body. He
        wants to destroy you. He ain’t satisfied if he don’t know what’s going on about it. So, he got to
        contending with Michael over the body of Moses, God hid Moses. I guess Moses gave the devil
        such a battle that he wanted to know where he was at. Hard to tell what he wanted to do with
        Moses! Huh! Looks like he hates us pretty bad, don’t it?
         Now notice here, I want to go to Revelation the 12th chapter now. Now, we’ll just kinda teach
        this out a little bit. My voice is gone and kinda sore. Let’s read here in Chapter 12. It’ll take me a
        little time. I want to get this off so I won’t have to come back to it, see. I think we need to fit this
        in the Revelation.
        Revelation 12:1-Scripture Reading;
        1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon
        under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
        “1 And there appeared” Have you got Revelation 12? “another great wonder in heaven; a
        woman clothed with the sun…”
         Now watch that. Now what is a woman? Is a church and clothed with the sun. Now this is the
        true church, this is the new testament church, clothed with the sun of righteousness. “and the
        moon under her feet.”
         Now, there goes to show you that the law is passing away and they type that denomination to
        with the law. And the law the moon is the reflection of the sun, only a reflection. And the
        moon…The moon is under her feet, now there is that Orthodox Jewish Church bringing forth and
        unfolding that new testament church, woman, and the sun, “and upon her head a crown of
        twelve stars.”
         That’s them twelve apostles, note that he called them stars. Shows you that God’s Bible is
        first in the heavens, see. And if you’re ever going to be in heaven with the Lord Jesus Christ and
        be in that number, your right up there in the universe somewhere. Maybe we all ought to go to
        the planetarium and maybe see ourselves there somewhere. How many believe that? I believe
        that with all my heart.
         Said, “Ye shall shine as the stars of the firmament.”
        Daniel 12:3-Reference quote:
        3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many
        to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
        Revelation 12:2-3-Scripture Ad Lib Reading;
        2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
        3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven
        heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
        
        36
        4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the
        dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon
        as it was born.
        5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her
        child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.
        6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they
        should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.
         And this woman had upon her head twelve stars which is the twelve apostles. “2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.”
        Now she’s getting ready to deliver something. “3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven.”
        Watch this now. “behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
        crowns upon his heads.” Now that’s that roman dragon see with all those governmental powers
        upon her head all those kings. 4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven,”
        My Lord.
        “…and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to
        be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
        5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child
        was caught up unto God, and to his throne.
        6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they
        should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days”.
         Now, notice here that this is the Orthodox Church lapping over and bringing in the New
        Testament church. The crown of stars upon her head and the sun was the Son of God, Son of
        righteousness bringing forth that New Testament church out of the law, the moon the old
        Orthodox Jewish Church. And she’s bringing forth the man child, which is Christ.
         Now notice here. That what was the other wonder in heaven was that the dragon. Another
        wonder in heaven was the dragon that in heaven he drew a third part of the stars of heaven, he
        drew them, see. He drew them together. Now notice that, that was Lucifer. This dragon was
        Lucifer that was kicked out of heaven, and he was jealous over Michael, right! Now watch here!
        He was jealous, Lucifer the devil was jealous of Michael, and his kingdom. And Lucifer was one
        of the great archangels of heaven, and he wasn’t satisfied with the position that he had. But he
        lusted to have more bigger beautiful kingdom than Michael in heaven.
         And he had jealousy and lust and all those things that you see in a lot of the preachers here on
        earth today. All them things I preached on in The Two Kingdoms coming down through there.
         Now notice here, that Lucifer drew a third part of those stars in heaven. Now it hard telling
        how many billions it is, I don’t know. But he drew a third part of them, I don’t know the number
        but I assure you that is a fantastic, fantastic number of stars that he drew over to his way of
        thinking.
         Showing you that every one of them stars that lined up with Michael’s preaching in heaven
        trying to get a greater kingdom. Brother do you realize that he made war in heaven and was
        gonna Lucifer was gonna try to take over Michael’s kingdom and the Lord God himself right up
        there on the throne.
         Do you think He fears God? Oh, brother that’s fearful to even preach about this. The devil
        don’t fear God at all. He fears him because he knows that he’s got an end, and he fears and
        trembles to think what’s going to happen to him. But he walks right up in the face and talks…
        
        37
        Who ever seen such a man like Cain that he talked right back to God, just defiled him to his face.
        And say, “I ain’t my brother’s keeper.” After he bashed (Abel’s) head in.
        Genesis 4:8-9-Reference quote:
        8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that
        Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
        9 And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my
        brother's keeper?
         Now notice here that Lucifer drew a third part of the stars of heaven and he drew them, how
        did he draw them? He drew them to himself by his way of thinking.
         Now notice, show me the preacher that is pastoring and you’re following, and I’ll show you
        the way that you’re thinking. And they lined up with Lucifer’s way of preaching because they
        were just like Lucifer too. Was they religious? Did they know how to worship God? Did they
        know about the Bible? They ought to, it was wrote right in the heavens. Do you think they know
        about having church? I’ll say they do!
         And he drew a third part of them. And what did God do? Michael…Michael and Lucifer got
        in a fight! And God let them fight it out. And Michael and his angels overcome Lucifer and his
        angels, and Michaels kicked them out of Heaven. Glory to God!! He kicked them out of here! He
        overcome them and whooped them and kicked them out of heaven.
         And where did they land? Right on the earth. And Satan, Lucifer, then took his throne in the
        lower atmosphere of heaven. And his demons then is right there with him one third part of all the
        stars of heaven.
         Oh, now watch this! Notice here, that Lucifer, the devil himself started… Now go back there
        in our kingdom tapes. How did he propagate this kingdom and what did he do? He come down
        and found himself a little virgin woman, called Eve that had never known anything about life,
        sexual relations and all that. Now you know we don’t believe here that Eve ate an apple. We sure
        don’t, that apple don’t fit nowhere in the scriptures, nowhere. And I’ve been preaching for years
        that there ain’t no apple in that thing. No, brother it wasn’t no apple tree that she ate of. It was
        sex now, sex is the God of this world, don’t you think it ain’t. You’ll be surprised when the
        Bridegroom pulls the covers off of this thing, you’ll be surprised who has fallen to the lust of this
        world. Don’t tell me! I was surprised here a few weeks ago when the Lord showed me something
        at four o’clock in the morning. I said surely not Lord! But he said different.
         Notice here that Lucifer was kicked out to the earth and a third part of those stars. And they
        were religious spiritual beings, and these third part of the stars was in position they was in
        heaven. And they were the stars of God, and they were in position, but because of lust and greed,
        like Lucifer, they were kicked out of heaven and they are religious to the core!! They are
        religious spirits. Religious!! They know how to worship the Lord, they know how to praise God,
        they know how to do all those things.
         Notice here that Lucifer, the devil, in order to propagate his kingdom, to be like the most-high
        God. He wanted to be like God. He wanted to be like the Lord, right? So now in order to do that
        he’s got to have subjects, he’s got to have subjects so he finds this little virgin called Eve. And
        he doesn’t have a corporal body he don’t have a seed. Satan don’t have no blood cell. He ain’t
        got no body. So, he got into the next creation to man Adam. And Lucifer the devil come inside,
        and devil possessed the beast which was the most subtle creature of the garden.
        
        38
         The devil what? The devil in the garden of God? Yes sir’re! He was right there in the garden
        of God. And Christ was in the garden of God. Christ was the tree of life, and the devil was the
        tree of knowledge of good and evil. He knew good and evil. Right! He knew it in heaven. And
        was jealous, evil. He was kicked out of heaven because of jealousy. And when you see these
        jealous preachers around, then you’ll know right there that they got something in them that’s like
        the devil. How many say amen to that? Notice that Lucifer got in the beast, and he possessed that
        beast. Now he’s got a blood cell to produce a baby that will be a progenerator of his kingdom.
        Oh ya! Yes sir’re.
         Now notice there, when Eve got deceived by this preacher!! Notice that when the devil got in
        that beast, immediately he started preaching to the church! Oh God! He started preaching to the
        church Eve. Isn’t Eve the church? Isn’t Eve the Bride? And he started preaching to the church
        and he preached to her a TWIST and a PERVERTED GOSPEL!! But he said, “Oh, God said…
        Oh, God said… but oh, he really meant this.” He changed the first messenger to the earth was
        God himself. And the devil took God’s message and twisted it just a little bit! Were they the
        elected seed that he was preaching to?

        62-0401 - Wisdom Versus Faith
        William Marrion Branham
        4 Now, of course, anything that the devil has, is a perversion of the original. Sin is a
        perversional, perversion of righteousness. Adultery is the perversion of a—of a legal act. A lie
        is the perversion of the truth. 95 And so the—the wisdom that I want you to get straightened out
        on, ’fore we start. There is a wisdom of God, a wisdom of God, is, stay with His Word. But
        Satan, in his wisdom, tried to twist the Word, so that’s the wisdom I’m speaking of. 96 There’s
        a certain amount of faith that goes with Satan. In order to—to accept Satan, you got to believe
        Satan, so there is a perverted faith to a perverted thing. And anything that would try to twist the
        Word of God, to make It say something that It doesn’t, is the wrong spirit, see, offering
        wisdom against God’s wisdom. So, we’re going to refer to it as wisdom, and not Satan’s faith.
        97 Many of those people that believe that, are sincere, and believe, just with all the faith that
        they got, that they’re right. See? You have to watch. The blanket stretches two ways now. But, he,
        they are…The only way to be sure, is come back to the original Word. There is where
        everything is based, on the Word. 98 Now, we find that these two factions, or sources, is: one,
        wisdom; and the other one, faith. And they versed one another since creation, in the garden of
        Eden.
         Notice that this Lucifer got in this beast. You know I went through all that, but just to kinda
        review a touch of it. And this beast committed sexual relations with Eve and got her pregnant,
        and then she went home to Adam and talked Adam into it. Adam was not deceived, because he
        was the revealed Word of God the spoken seed Word, and he could not be deceived. Hey! And
        he had no way for Satan to plant his seed in him, no way in the world! Why? Because he was the
        perfect creation of God! Created in God’s own image. Right! Shows you that Jesus can’t be
        deceived, but the Bride can! Huh! And if it wasn’t for Jesus today, she’d be deceived again.

        63-0728 - Christ Is The Mystery Of God Revealed
        William Marrion Branham
        523 And the Body must follow the Head, as the wife follows the husband. Being that Adam was
        not deceived, he walked out with Eve. Eve was deceived, she was in the transgression, or the
        entire resurrection of the whole Body would have come forth at the day of the Lord Jesus
        when He come forth from the grave. But He had to redeem Her, which is His Body. She has to
        be redeemed in order to come to Him. Do you see it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Oh
        my! See, it couldn’t have happened then. The redemption is going on. 524 Now you see the
        Seals? When He’s in His mediatorial work back there, redeeming, but some day He comes forth
        to get this Book that He’s redeemed. And all that’s in this Book would be Him, for that’s the
        believer, the words in the Book, and the Word is Him. And all that’s in that, He come forth for
        this Book of Redemption, whose names are written on the Book before the foundation of the
        world, when He was slain as a Lamb. 525 And here He is today, in His Word, manifesting the
        same thing He did there. She can’t recognize another headship. No, sir. There’s no bishop, no
        nothing. She recognizes one Headship, that’s Christ, and Christ is the Word. Oh, my! Whew! I
        love that. Uh! Yes, sir. 526 As the Head was took up from the grave, so must His Body follow
        Him into Eden. Therefore, the Body cannot recognize any other headship, but the Headship of
        the Word. 527 No denomination can put anything to It. “For whosoever shall take one Word
        away from It, or add one word to It, it took away from It.” You’re dead, hybrid, right there.
        She’s back here, this testimony in her hands, “the filthiness of her fornications, committing in
        spiritual adultery,” against the very Word that she claims to believe. See? 528 Therefore, it’s
        the Word, or nothing. That’s right. He, the Word! How do you know it’s right? He, the Word,
        is vindicated. See? He, the Word, properly vindicated, is the Headship, the Head of the
        Church. He is the Word, the Headship. He is properly identificate, identified, vindicated, by
        His Own Spirit being in the Church Itself, the person. Showing forth Himself, in vindication,
        is the direct proof to the entire Body. You don’t need creeds, then. Denominations has perished.
        But the Headship Itself, recognized in the Body by personal identifications, see, identifying
        Himself, proves the Headship to the Body. Then, we are united under One vindicated
        Headship, that is, Christ, the Word of God [Blank spot on tape—Ed.] not under any church. 529
        Then, our Headship is a Kingdom. “The Kingdom of God is within you,” said the Bible, Jesus.
        The Kingdom! We are not a denomination. We belong to a Kingdom, and the Kingdom is the
        Word of God made Spirit and Life in our own life, bringing to pass every promise in this day,
        as it did in that day when the Word and God was one. And the Word and God is one in His
        Church today, making It the Headship of the Body that is redeemed, to bring the Message in
        the last day; and be taken up from the dead, in the resurrection, to go back and restore again,
        as Adam and Eve, in the beginning in the garden of Eden. The threefold mystery of God, His
        Body! Oh, my!
         Now notice here, that the only way that Satan could get to Eve was she had to be on the
        outside of Adam. As long as she was in Adam… She was once in Adam, right? Adam was both
        Eve an Adam. And as long as Eve was in Adam brother, she was safe from the devil. The devil
        could not get Eve as long as she was in Adam. AND THAT’S WHY WE BETTER HURRY UP
        AND GET INTO OUR ADAM, CHRIST, TODAY BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS A ROARING
        
        40
        LION OUT HERE. AND IF WE EVER GET INTO CHRIST, HE CANNOT TOUCH US. Glory
        to God!! Amen!
         People say, glory to God I’m saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost, but I didn’t mean
        to run around on my wife! But the devil went and…. No. No. No. No, he never! Brother if you
        ever get in Christ your saved to sin no more, I tell ya! Your saved to sin no more! Shows you that
        you just thought you were in there, you wasn’t!
         But as long as Eve was in Adam the devil couldn’t touch her, couldn’t get to her no way, as
        long as she was in Adam. Don’t you see? OH, MY FRIEND, THAT’S WHY I KEEP TELLING
        YOU THE BRIDE IS STILL ON THE OUTSIDE OF HER ADAM TODAY! WHY? SO, SHE
        COULD BE TESTED BY LUCIFER AND THE DEVILS KINGDOM TODAY! There would
        be no test if she was in Adam! (Brother Lambert knocks on pulpit) But God knew that she was
        gonna take the test, and she was gonna fall, so, He could be a savior!
         If there wasn’t nobody lost, He could never be a savior. So there, Christ, God himself, took
        Eve outside of Adam and when he. Took Eve outside of Adam and she was beautiful, as she
        walked through the garden one day there was Lucifer that was kicked out of heaven and begin to
        preach the gospel to her. And what? He reached over and gave her a sensation and the next thing
        you know he gave her a blood cell, a seed, and come forth from her Cain.
         Don’t tell me preacher that a perfect creation like Adam could bring forth a murderer like
        Cain! Never! And she brought forth Cain, and Cain was the devil. Was the devil’s baby. Let’s
        say it like this! Cain was Satan’s baby! I know this modern-day ain’t gonna believe that teaching
        of the prophet of God brought. But I believe it with all my heart, because it’s the only thing that
        will make the Bible live. And you say, it’s just a spiritual seed. It’s just spiritual? Then Jesus was
        just spiritual, and never born by the virgin Mary. Oh, you can’t get out of it.
         Now notice here now that here now… I’ll tell you one thing that devil never let any other
        demon do the job, he done it himself. Because he was gonna be the father of this kingdom. He’s
        gonna be God of this baby. Right? Yes sir! Now…Now he wants to be a God. Now he’s got him
        a baby and from this baby, Cain, he’s gonna take Cain’s seed now and propagate the earth with
        that seed, with children of the devil. Children of the devil you say? Yes, children of the devil and
        that’s Satan’s kingdom.
         Now notice here that one third of them stars is kicked out of heaven. Not only was Lucifer
        kicked out of heaven and came down and got in the beast by his spirit and pregnated Eve with
        Cain. Right? Not only that, but brother we still got one third of other spirits there to deal with.
         Now notice here in Revelation 12, it said, “A great wonder in heaven and a third of these stars
        he did cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be
        delivered.” Right!
        Revelations 12:4-Scripture Reading;
        4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the
        dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon
        as it was born.
         All right now, now watch this devil! Watch this devil! What did Cain do? Immediately when
        his brother got a Revelation on the Word of God… Cain was religious as could be. He come
        before the Lord and lit a fire; we went through that before. And what did he do? He got mad at
        the Revelation. Abel got a Revelation of who Cain was, what seed he was… Remember how we
        went through that. And then He realized that his daddy wasn’t his daddy. Here’s two kingdoms,
        
        41
        two seeds. So, He (Cain) picked up a rock and bashed his (brother Abel’s) head in. Showing you
        that seed of the serpent in that kingdom of the devil will kill you, he’ll kill you!
         All right now notice he’s religious to the core, and he may out shine the other real seed. He
        may worship the Lord and praise him and read his Bible and say I believe everything, but he
        could be a seed of the serpent. Do you believe?
         All right now notice here, go on down through there. Now let’s just take a couple of
        (examples) and look at them. Let’s look at Moses. Whose seed was Moses now? God’s seed.
        Notice Moses was God’s prophet to be the deliverer.
         Now what happened? Notice, there that right at the time the devil, Lucifer, and his demons
        must have heard Jose belle and them praying for that deliverer to come. And then they knew that
        God spoke to her and she got all excited about it and she praised the Lord about it, and he must
        have heard it. And he knew that she was gonna give birth to something that was gonna cause him
        a lot of trouble in his kingdom. And what did he do? Pharaoh rose up and then they begin to kill
        all the first born. But God kept his hand on his seed. Hallelujah! God is gonna protect that seed.
        Glory to God! Amen! And he put it in a little basket and let it float down the water through all
        the crocodiles and floated it right back into the hands of the seed of the serpent, ole Pharaoh
        himself and fooled him. Didn’t he pull one over on Pharaoh? Pharaoh went out there, the devil
        through Pharaoh, went out there and begin to kill all them first born trying to get that seed of the
        righteous.
         Hold it there. Now remember, Lucifer heard the Voice of God in the garden say I will bring
        enmity, he said to the women. “I’m going to put enmity between thy seed and the serpent’s seed.
        And the serpent, Lucifer heard that sentencing on him, and he knew that one day there was
        gonna be a seed that would come forth from God given to some woman THAT WAS GONNA
        CAUSE HIM ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE! AND BRUISE HIS HEAD!! Hallelujah!! Ole
        Lucifer thought, ole Moses may be the one. Maybe this thing coming forth from Jochebelle,
        maybe this is gonna be the one here. And so, he sent out and begin to kill all them first born.
         But they didn’t fear Pharaoh’s command. Why? Because they had a Revelation from God.
        They didn’t fear… Oh, we don’t have to fear what the World Council of Churches think. We’ll
        kill you everyone. There’s one thing that God won’t let you do, because Michael’s here and his
        angels. He’s able to melt the swords or wither up the hand, anything he wants to do. Now they
        put little Moses in the bull rush and you children know that story, and floated him right down
        back to Pharaoh’s house. Because Jochebed was poor and couldn’t raise Moses’ right, so God
        just sent a little predestinated seed right back down into Pharaoh’s and made him feed him all the
        days of his life. BROTHER, GOD FOOLED THE DEVIL SO BAD THAT HERE WAS THE
        DEVIL FEEDING GOD’S RIGHTEOUS SEED AND TAKING CARE OF HIM ALL OF HIS
        DAYS. Amen! Boy, you talk about pulling one over on the devil, he sure done it then didn’t he?
        And here all the time ole Pharaoh loved Moses and didn’t know that he was the one that was
        gonna get his kingdom. My Lord! Turned him right around and made him love him. First, he
        wanted to kill him, and now God fooled him and now made him love him. And now he’s gonna
        turn all his domain over to him. Turned around brother, Moses was the fall of his kingdom.
        Moses was the fall of his kingdom. My Lord!
         All right, I’ll say I liked that, didn’t you? (Amen) Oh, don’t you like the way the Lord does
        things? Can you beat him? I ask you; can you beat him? Oh, my, his wonders supersede... How
        he does these marvelous things. Oh, I love him. My, my! Can you imagine all the wonderful
        little things He’s got prepared down the road, for His little Bride? Just makes you excited and
        want to praise him you know.
        
        42
         All right, look here. Notice how that, that Lucifer, that seed of the serpent and his children
        always persecuted the prophets and killed them all the time. Right? Look how Jezebel… if you
        check her genealogy, she come right out of Cain’s linage. Come right through there. Come right
        out of that ungodly line there. See that seed of the serpent? And what was she, she was always
        after Elijah, the prophet, all the time. I’ll have your head I’ll have you killed before morning.
        Showing you that seed of Lucifer, the devil, was after the seed of God. Satan has to kill this seed.
        Everywhere he can find that seed, he’s got to kill it, because he knows that out of that seed of
        God is gonna be given to some woman sometime, that’s gonna bruise his head. He knows that
        there’s gonna come a seed some time that’s gonna bruise his head, so he’s got to get it.
        Genesis 3:15-Scripture Reference:
        15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it
        shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
         Now notice, we find this happened at Calvary when the angel, Gabriele, appeared to a little
        virgin Mary and said, “Mary blessed are you honey among all the little churches, you have found
        favor in the sight of God almighty. I was just sent from his presence to come and tell you that,
        that holy thing that’s gonna come forth from thee is gonna call it Jesus. And it’s gonna save His
        people from their sins.
        Matthew 1:21-Reference quote:
        21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his
        people from their sins.

        179 So I’ve watched for something. HAS IT SLIPPED BY US IN HUMILITY AND WE’VE
        MISSED IT? IS IT GONE AND THE CHURCH IS LEFT IN HER SINS? If that be so, then
        it’s later than you think. If not, then there’s coming one with a Message that’s straight on the
        Bible, and quick work will circle the earth. The seeds will go in newspapers, reading material,
        until every predestinated Seed of God has heard It. None of them will come unless the Father
        has drawed them, and every one the Father has drawed will hear It and come. That’ll be, the
        predestinated Seed will hear the Word.

        7 And that’s the way many people are tonight. Them ladies, or whoever it was setting here last
        night in wheelchairs, they heard the good news. Tonight their wheelchairs are not here. They’re
        probably setting out there in the audience somewhere. See? They were free; they were free all
        the time. Jesus cut them loose at Calvary, when the Bloodstream came from His body to free
        every person from sickness. The sinners that accepted Christ last night, was setting bound, last
        
        43
        night under the chain of sin, and tonight is enjoying the freedom of the Lord Jesus, after they
        heard of the emancipation of the proclamation; they are free. 18 And during the time of the
        slavery, before the Emancipation of the Proclamation was signed, why, they tell me that the
        slaves in the south, would climb up the hill. They’s—they’s going to be free at sunrise. Some
        could tr—climb a little higher than the others. The older ones couldn’t get up, the younger went
        on to the top of the hill. For as soon as they seen the sun, they were free. So the ones that got the
        highest, just as soon as the sun peeped up, they said, “We are free!” Hollered it to the next
        group, the next one hollered, “We are free!” On down the hill passing the news, “We are free!”
        And every man that sees the Son is free. You know what I mean. You see the Son, see Him in
        the way of the revelation that God has revealed Him to you. The only way you’ll ever know it,
        is when God has revealed Him to you. That’s the basis of all the Scriptures. “Flesh and blood
        has not revealed it to thee, but My Father which is in Heaven. Upon this rock I’ll build My
        church.” Is that right? SO IT’S SPIRITUAL REVELATION OF THE LORD JESUS
        CHRIST, IS WHERE HE BUILT HIS CHURCH. 19 Now, little did the old-timers back in
        there maybe realize that it would be in this way. If they, by faith, saw the complete time of
        redemption, and they’d see people who would be absolutely introduced to the infallible proofs
        of redemption, and turn around and leave it… That’s the sad part, the fellow that’s loose, and
        don’t want to be free. Now, Adam in the garden of Eden, when he first sinned, God had a way of
        redemption for him, right quick, just as soon as he sinned. God made a way of redemption.
        And before Adam could ever approach back to fellowship with the Father, God had to slay an
        innocent lamb, or sheep, and make him a cloth to go around him, and throw out the welcome
        carpet for Adam to walk back on the carpet of redemption, to come into His Presence again.
        God always had a plan of redemption, and that’s been through blood, ever since the very
        beginning and dawn of time, perceived in the mind of God, before the world ever come into
        existence. 20 Now, when Adam and Eve, our first father and mother, started walking out of the
        garden of Eden, why, cloudily, the sin hanging over their brows, and the clouds of darkness
        hanging around them after they had received their—the word of their Eternal destination. They
        walked out, with those bloody sheepskins around them, they had some little ray of hope, that
        sometime, there was coming a redeemer. See? They had a ray of hope. It was cloudy and dark,
        because tears of regret was falling down their cheeks
        from their sins. And they were sorry of their sins, but they were—they knew that somewhere
        there’d be a redemption, because He said, “I’ll put enmity between her seed and the serpent’s
        seed.” And they… So many people, in quoting the 23rd Psalm, say, like this, say, “Yea, though I
        walk through the dark valleys of the shadows of death…” It doesn’t say dark valley; it said,
        “Through the valley of the shadow…” And if it’s dark, there’d be no shadow. It takes a certain
        amount of light to make shadow. 21 So death, after the very beginning, never had a complete
        darkness; it was a shadow. So there had to be a certain percent of light. And when Adam and
        Eve was walking out of the garden of Eden, the shadows of redemption was before them.
         Boy, it ain’t changed none today either. Don’t you just love that? He’s gonna save His people
        from their sins.
         Now notice here, that when Mary was pained to be delivered of the child… Here we go now!
        The dragon stood right before her through (King) Herod. Where was Lucifer? Where was that
        devil? Where was that seed of the serpent? Right in the King Herod. And he stood right before
        
        44
        Mary to kill and devour the Christ child when it was born. Is that right? But notice here how the
        Lord God fooled him. He sent the three wise men. You know the story right! Sent the three wise
        men later and he tried to kill him again there. But the Angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph
        and sent Mary away you see. Then brought her back again later. Then there was that ole devil
        again in that king. Come down there with the wise men and said, tell me when you find the
        Christ child? Let me know, I want to come and worship him, too. I want to come and worship
        him, too I want to kill him. And the Lord said, don’t you tell nobody about that and don’t let him
        know I, because he seeks to kill the child, see. Now look at that children, just look at that how
        that devil wants to kill the seed. Now notice here, the devil thought he really had got Jesus when
        he was at Calvary, see. He thought he’d really got him. But really, he was bruising his head and
        he didn’t know it, see. See, he thought he was defeated hanging up there on the cross, but there
        was the seed that was promised from Genesis that was to bruise his head. But now notice he
        bruised his head but he didn’t cut it off. He made a way he bruised it, and he made away for his
        head to be completely chopped off later!
         Now notice here, that Satan went on conquering even after Calvary. He went on conquering
        and put every child of God in the grave yard. Afflicting them with all kinds of sicknesses from
        his kingdom and put them in the graveyard and conquered every one of them through death.
        Right?
         But Jesus was the only one that never did conquer through death, because He rose from the
        grave. Why? Because He was that seed that was promised from Genesis. Now notice here, that
        this seed of Christ, now coming down here to the end-time, is to be prophesied again to be given
        to another virgin.
         How many remember the time when the Lord told you older people that was here a few years
        ago, when the Lord God come to me about 4:00 o’clock in the morning and showed me a
        Palestinian little woman. A Palestinian woman with a long flowing garment on and down on the
        border of her garment was written letters, “I Will Receive a Seed!” And I didn’t have the
        revelation of it at that time. Remember all that? Now, he showed me that was the Bride, showed
        me that was the Bride that said, I will receive a seed. And that seed come from the Son of Man,
        that was the seed sower in the end-time. He sows the seed of Christ into the woman, the church,
        the Bride. The wise virgin, the bride, gets pregnated with Christ.

        66 We find out that when a man comes, sent from God, ordained of God, with the true THUS
        SAITH THE LORD, the message and the messenger are one and the same. Because he is sent to
        represent THUS SAITH THE LORD, Word by Word, so he and his message is the same. 67 A
        denominational man under denominational auspices, he and the church is the “one.” A
        theologian under theology, made by some denomination, he and his message are one; church of
        theology, a theologian. It’s correctly. 68 Then when a man comes with THUS SAITH THE
        LORD, he and the Message is one. And when Elijah come with THUS SAITH THE LORD, he
        and his message became one. Just as Jesus, when He come, He was the Word, Saint John 1.
        So the Word of God and the messenger of the age was the selfsame thing, all the time. That’s
        right. 69 Jesus was the Word that was prophesied of. He was what the prophets said would
        happen, “A virgin shall conceive and bear this Child.” Way back in the beginning, God told
        
        45
        them, said, “The woman’s Seed shall bruise the serpent’s head, and he’ll bruise her heel.” All
        these prophecies had been given. David crying, all the rest of the prophets down through the
        ages, speaking of Him. He was that Word manifested! Hallelujah! 70 Now do you see where I’m
        trying to get to? I spoke with you pretty plain this morning. DON’T YOU SEE THE
        AUTHORITY OF THE LIVING GOD IN THE LIVING CHURCH, THE BRIDE? The sick
        are healed, the dead are raised up, the cripples walk, the blind see, the Gospel goes forth in Its
        power, for the Message and the messenger are the same. The Word is in the Church, in the
        person.

        260 Pentecost has done the same. They speak in tongues, and so forth, “That’s all you have to
        do. That’s got it. Come on, join the church.” All right. Get your false baptism, and so forth,
        and go on, “And that’s all you have to do.” See? 261 BUT WHEN CHRIST COMES, HE’S
        COMING FOR A VIRGIN WITH…A CHURCH WITHOUT EVEN ONE SPOT OR ONE
        WRINKLE OF DENOMINATION OR ANY OTHER THING, DOGMAS MIXED WITH IT.
        IT’S GOING TO BE WORD, AND THAT ALONE. 262 Now, oh, man, here we are! Blessed be
        the Lord! Now we come to the Body to be the Bride of Christ, now to be His “flesh of His flesh,
        and bone of His bone.” Now, we’ll hurry up now. “Flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.”
        Why didn’t… 263 Ask you a question. Why didn’t all your rains, back yonder, bring the bride to
        Christ? I want you to answer me that. If…His Coming is overdue. We believe it. (Like it was in
        the days of Noah, longsuffering, He’s getting His Bride ready.) Why didn’t these rains…Why
        didn’t you Pentecostals back yonder, a few years ago, when you started, forty, fifty years ago,
        why didn’t you bring Christ, the Bridegroom, to the bride? Going to let that soak, a minute.
        Why? BECAUSE YOU PREGNATED HER, YOURSELF, WITH YOUR DENOMINATION.
        THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DONE. HE WON’T MARRY A WHORE. He’ll marry a
        virgin. It’s flat, but that’s the Truth. You know It, in a flat way. You don’t have to wonder. I
        don’t stumble around about It. Tell you the Truth. WHY DIDN’T IT BRING HER? WHY
        DIDN’T IT BRING CHRIST, BRING CHRIST TO HER? BECAUSE SHE’S NOT FIT. HE
        FOUND HER IN ADULTERY. 264 Exactly the reason children don’t live forever when
        they’re born; Adam found his wife pregnated. 265 That’s the reason Jehovah had to take a
        Gentile Bride; found her pregnated. 266 That’s exactly the way Christ has to get Him a Bride
        now; He’s found the so-called group pregnated. HE’S GOING TO SOW HIS SEED.
        SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET IT, BECAUSE THEY’RE PREDESTINATED TO BE A
        CHURCH AT THE END OF THE ROAD. 267 Like Adam and Jehovah’s, He found them
        pregnated with man-made doctrines of denominations. Like God’s Truth, in Genesis 1, “Every
        seed has brought forth after its kind.” So, when the Spirit fell on her, man had been there to
        her womb, and filled it with denominational seeds of his own thinking, so that’s why she got to
        be the way she is, and Christ could not come to her. Hum! That’s hard, isn’t it?
        
         Now Christ coming the second time when he’s born again, when the bride travails and gives
        birth again to Christ. Now He’s not coming to suffer at Calvary, now He’s coming to destroy the
        
        46
        devil. He’s coming to put every enemy under His foot. He’s not coming to suffer now; He’s
        coming to rule and reign with a rod of iron. Do you believe it?
         All right! Now let’s watch here! Now notice here. Now here when Jesus fully matured started
        his ministry… now notice here that when He come up to people that had the devil in them… now
        notice people had devils in them. Now who were those devils? Those devils that were in the man
        at Gadara. The ole man at Gadara, let’s take him. Now he had a legion of devils in him and those
        devils was the very spirits that was kicked out of heaven.
         Now notice here that they immediately knew Jesus when He come. And Jesus, a little tiny
        fella, walked over that hill and walked up and here to that man there who was naked and had no
        clothes on. Shows you when you take your clothes off your crazy. Right? And there he come
        running down through there naked, and the devil cried up out of him and said, “Thou art Jesus
        the Son of God, have you come here to torment us before our time?” They knew it wasn’t time
        Jesus have you come here to torment us before our time? THOSE DEVILS KNEW THAT IT
        WASN’T TIME YET FOR THEM TO BE TORMENTED. Glory to God!
         Saints don’t let that slip by you! Have you come here to torment us before our time? He said,
        if you’re going to make us come out, let us go into these swine here. Then He said, Come out!
        But oh… Brother! Brother, Brother, if you think the devil squalled then, how do you think he’s
        gonna squall brother, when their time has run out.
         The little Bride is gonna rise up with Michael and his angels in his kingdom and they are
        gonna torment the devil and his angels, and cast him out! Their time for tormenting is running
        out and now they’re gonna be tormented. Glory to God!
         Oh, they cried, “Oh, we know thee, who thou art!” You know, one of the Bride! “We know
        thee who thou art. Have you come now, is our time up?” YES, YOUR TIME’S UP! COME OUT
        OF THERE!! Your times up now all of you! Time shall be no more, for you!
         Oh… God hasten that day. Cripple limbs turn loose, cancers melt away. Oh brother, is there
        gonna be deliverance in Zion? For Michael shall come and every one whose name is written in
        the Book, shall be delivered in Zion. And out of Zion shall be a great deliverance in that day,
        saith the Lord. The devils time is running out. Boy, that’s good. “Ya Jesus, have you come here
        to torment us before our time?” Here was that Christ seed, Jesus. But the time to be tormented
        brother is really today.

        correction, for understanding, that we might know just how to live in this present day; what to
        look forward to, what to do. FOR, WE KNOW THE COMING OF THE LORD IS DRAWING

        God, let us, every one, be there, Father. May there not be one missing. That’s our purpose of
        being here, Lord. We love You, and we’re trying to prepare for that hour.
         Now notice here, let’s go on down here a minute in verse 7. Oh, this is wonderful! Oh, I tell
        you the devil hates it, boy don’t you think he don’t. Don’t you know he’s trembling tonight? He
        knows it brother his time is about up here. Times about up, we’re going into war with him in just
        a little bit. We’re not bothering him now. We’re not bothering him now. He’s ruling in his
        kingdom. He’s having his way, “he’s a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour.”
        1 Peter 5:8-Reference quote:
        8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about,
        seeking whom he may devour:
        But just as soon as Michael and the angels is ready to do battle, and pulls up there beside the
        little Bride and begins to minister to her.
         Oh brother, oh Phillip you know Michael come down and his angels, and come up beside
        them hundred and twenty come up out of the upper room and little Phillip went up there and
        brother, devils was cryin and squalling and he was casting them out left and right, wasn’t he?
        What do you think it’ll be today with this little Bride?
         Now notice here and hurrying. Now in Revelation 12:7 and now watch here. Now let’s look
        at verse 5.
        Revelation 12:5-9-Scripture Reading;
        5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her
        child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.
         “5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron.” Brother,
        He ain’t coming to suffer and die at Calvary no more, He’s coming to rule with a rod of iron,
        “and her child was caught up unto God, and to His throne.” ‘6 And the woman the church fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God,
        that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. “7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the
        dragon fought and his angel. “8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. “9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which
        deceiveth the whole world.”
        
        48
         Notice here, this is not the casting out from the first time he was cast out of heaven. Because
        he was not the devil then, he was Lucifer. There’s something here! How many see that? He was
        not the devil up there, he was not the devil up there, he was Lucifer. Now notice here, here is
        Michael the archangel doing battle with the great dragon, the great dragon, now the great dragon,
        the dragon was the Roman Empire. That’s when he come in that Roman Empire and got into
        them emperors. Showing you that it was not there, see.
         Now notice here over in Isaiah 14 when the disciples came back and said, Master, the devils
        are just subject to us at your name. He said, don’t marvel at that, I saw Lucifer fall from heaven.
        He said, I saw Lucifer fall from heaven, he knows me real well. I was the one that kicked him
        out.
        Luke 10:17-20-Reference quote:
        17 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us
        through thy name.
        18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
        19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of
        the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
        20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice,
        because your names are written in heaven.
        Isaiah 14:12-Reference quote:
        12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to
        the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
         See, they didn’t know who he was, see… Before Abraham was, I am! Oh Lord! Now see, that
        boy stands there, that’s the revealed Word, and knows all them things, poor little fella’s going
        around and they don’t know what’s going on. It’s about the same today too.
        John 8:58-Reference quote:
        58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
         “Oh Lord, the devils are subject to us.” He said, “Now children don’t be rejoicing because
        devils are being subject.” Said, “Rejoice that your names are wrote in the Lambs Book of Life.”
        He said, “I beheld Satan as he fell from heaven. I beheld Lucifer as he fell from heaven.”
         Now, he could of went on talking and said, “Children I kicked Lucifer out of heaven.” Now
        that would have made it worse and confused them the much more. But he said, “But I beheld him
        when he fell from heaven.” And where did he fall? He fell and landed right in Eden, and did his
        dirty work in Eden and propagated his kingdom.
         Alright now, we come down over through here how he got in (King) Harrod. How he got into
        Pharaoh’s. How he got in all those great kingdoms down through there and killed and martyred
        the saints and burn them in the coliseum at Rome, fed them to lions. And he come down through
        there, the dragon, he’s the devil now, and he’s Lucifer. He’s Satan. Now notice here. Watch here
        now, “He was the great dragon and he was cast out.”
        
        49
        Revelation 12:9-Scripture Reading;
        9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which
        deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
         Glory to God children, there’s another casting out time coming. He hasn’t deceived the whole
        earth yet. When he was kicked out of heaven and landed in Eden there wasn’t even no nations
        then. But here he went out and deceived the whole world. Amen.
         And “He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.”
         Alright now what is this? Now here, through the denominational churches, through the
        hierarchy of Rome, he has put out his doctrine and he has deceived the whole world. He’s
        deceived the United States. He deceived Russia. He deceived all the great nations of the world
        Satan has, right! And they’ve never seen him and they don’t know him, but he has deceived them
        all. Now here he is still sitting up here in heaven in the realms of the atmosphere with all his
        demon power working for him in all the government. The United States is the Kingdom of Satan.
        Russia is the Kingdom of Satan, China, every nation on earth is the kingdom of Satan. Right?
         Now notice here, Michael and his angels is now making war again. It shows you that we’re
        right at the door now when Michael and his angels is gonna be in another great battle with
        Lucifer, and the third part of his angels that was kicked out of heaven before. Now he’s gonna
        kick them out of heaven again.
         Now where is the devil at now? Where is Lucifer at? He’s sitting in the realms of heaven
        here. And he goes up before the presence of the Lord God and he goes up there and accuses
        Brother Bob. “Do you see what Brother Bob said the other day? Now he said something the
        other day that he shouldn’t have said. Now he thought something he shouldn’t of thought, now
        you see that he’s a sinner. You don’t see no perfection in him now, Lord. And he calls your name
        one by one. And he goes by when you make a little mistake and goes up there before the Lord,
        “Now, now there’s your child, now see what they done!” Right? But what does He do, says,
        “Yea that’s right, ya but look at the blood! LOOK AT THE BLOOD! I KNOW HE’S NOT
        PERFECT YET, BUT HE’S GONNA BE! I’m working on him, there’s my blood! “Yes” He
        said, “Yes there’s the blood.” Then he goes down to earth and comes back up again. “Now Lord,
        now, just look a there what she done, did you see? Just look a there! Did you see, what she…?”
        “Ya, but there’s the blood!” And continually he goes and accuses the elected night and day.
        Night and day, he goes up and down the earth with his demons and gets all kinds of reports and
        takes them back up there and accuses the poor little elected children all the time, up in the realms
        of heaven. And his demons are just working on you. You’re resting and sleeping, and there he is
        trying to lay a trap for you on your job the next day. While you’re sleeping resting there, he is,
        he’s got something working on you right there. “All right about a hundred of you go up there and
        attack ole Brother Brothers. Now he’s gonna be going down the street in his police car tomorrow
        and I want this woman to come out of here and you get on that women and just make her throw a
        glass of beer in his face and just cuss him up one side and down the other. And make him get
        mad and lose his temper and just act awful. Well, we know Brother Brothers never did do that.
        Let’s just say done it. Lord, did you see what Brother Brothers done today? Hey, did you see
        that, now!” That’s the way he does. Yes, but he’s under the blood. He’s mine, he’s covered by
        my blood. I’m standing for him, I’m his perfection, I’m standing for him. There He is! Where is
        it? He’s right there tonight, he’s done it!
        
        50
        Revelation 12:10-Reference quote:
        10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the
        kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down,
        which accused them before our God day and night.
         OH, CHILDREN CAN’T YOU SEE, THAT HE DIED FOR YOUR PERFECTION! IT’S
        ALL IN CHRIST! CHRIST IS MY PERFECTION! He’ll accuse you night and day, but Christ,
        but Christ His blood, His blood.
         But oh, I love him so much I don’t want to do nothing wrong, Lord. Will you forgive me for
        that, Father? God, give me more strength more grace God. Don’t let me lose my temper, Lord
        don’t let me think those things, God don’t let me do that. We’re covered by the blood!
         I never will forget one night the Lord showed me, I was laying out there straight out like a
        dead man, and over top of me, over top of me was a great big ball of blood. And over top of that
        blood was that pillar of fire whirling around there, but it was over top of the blood and the blood
        was over me a great big beautiful… just like shed blood picked right out of a bowl and it was just
        hanging right over me like that. And I was just paralyzed by that, you know. And over top of that
        was a pillar of fire whirling around. I said, “Oh God, thank you, I’m covered by the blood, Lord!
        Covered by the blood!”
         And that’s what we are, covered by the blood of the Lamb. He’s the perfect one. He’s our
        justification. He’s our sanctification. He’s our holiness. He’s our righteousness. And we’re not
        looking at what we are, but we’re looking to what He is! So, he comes up and accuses you, Jesus
        points to the blood.
         Alright now watch here, Michael and his angels is gonna have a war one more time with
        Lucifer and his angels. And they are gonna overcome Lucifer and his angels and kick them out
        of where they are at now. What for? Well let’s see what for.
         Now, children here is a marvelous thing, a marvelous thing. Now let’s look in verse 10. Well
        let’s read verse 9 again.
        Revelation 12:9,10-Scripture Ad lib Reading;
        9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which
        deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
        10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the
        kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down,
        which accused them before our God day and night.
         “9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent…”…cast out of where? Cast out of
        Heaven, where he accuses you! “…called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole
        world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” “10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the
        kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
        down…… out of heaven……which accused them before our God day and night.”
         Now comes the power of God and salvation, and the power of His might, WHEN THE
        DEVIL IS CAST OUT OF HEAVEN.
         We ever sing that song here, until the church is saved to sin no more. All right now what is it?
        Now notice here, until you come into Christ, until you come into Christ, the devil is gonna
        
        51
        accuse you. Because you’ll never be perfect until you can come into Christ. Now once you come
        into the body of Christ, you’re perfect as God is perfect, then.
         Now notice there that there will come an hour when the last elected member of the body, of
        the last elected member comes into the body of the Lord Jesus. When that last elected believer
        comes into Christ by one Token baptism and comes into His body. The last one comes in there,
        then the blood leaves the mercy seat!

        63-0317E - The Breach Between The Seven Church Ages And The Seven Seals
        William Marrion Branham
        266 The Seals was broke (why?) in the last church age, to reveal these Truths. Why? THE
        LAMB BROKE THE SEALS AND REVEALED THEM TO HIS CHURCH, IN ORDER TO
        COLLECT HIS SUBJECTS FOR HIS KINGDOM. HIS BRIDE, see! Oh, my! He wants to
        bring His subjects to Him now. 267 What is it? Out of the dust of the earth, out of the bottom of
        the sea, out of the pits, out of everywhere and every place, out of—out of the regions of the dark,
        out of paradise, wherever they may be. He’ll call, and they’ll answer. Amen! Amen!
        [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] He’ll call, and they’ll answer. 268 He come to get His
        subjects. He revealed His secrets, and they saw It. “And time is no more,” at that time. “Time
        has run out.” It’s finished. ALL RIGHT. 269 HE LEAVES THE THRONE, TO BE AN
        INTERCESSOR, AS A SLAIN LAMB; TO BE A LION, KING; TO BRING THE WORLD
        TO JUDGMENT, WHO HAS REJECTED HIS MESSAGE. He’s not a Mediator. 270
        Remember the Old Testament teaching now, as we hurry. WHEN THE BLOOD WENT OFF
        THE MERCY SEAT, WHAT WAS IT? JUDGMENT SEAT. 271 AND WHEN THE LAMB,
        SLAIN, WALKED FORWARD FROM ETERNITY, OUT OF THE FATHER’S THRONE,
        AND TOOK HIS RIGHTS, IT WAS A JUDGMENT SEAT. Then He become, not a Lamb, but
        a Lion, King, and He calls for His Queen to come stand by His side. 272 “Know ye not the
        saints shall judge the earth?” Daniel said, “The Judgment was set, and the books were opened;
        and ten thousands times ten thousands of thousand ministered to Him,” King and Queen. “And
        then another Book was opened, which was the Book of Life,” that’s for the church. And the
        Queen and the King stood there.
         See now, I have to differ with my brothers on that, I just can’t see it no other way. But I know
        this is right! And brother, if that blood ain’t there you’re in terrible shape tonight because that
        devil is right up there accusing you, and you ain’t got no blood there. And if there ain’t no blood
        there, you and I are a goner.
         But when that last elected member comes into the body of Christ, then what happens, the
        rapture is ready to take place.
         What happens now? All the third part of them stars demons falling stars, all them demons,
        and Lucifer is there in the atmosphere. Now, what are they gonna do? They are gonna hinder you
        from going in the rapture. They are gonna fight against you going in the rapture. So, what
        Michael does, he goes up there Michael goes up there and kicks them all out clears all the
        atmosphere the heavens out so the Bride can go through there to the Marriage Supper of the
        Lamb. Glory to God! Do you believe? (Amen) Do you really believe that? (Amen) Now the Lord
        don’t want no hindrance. So, Michael and his angels, right before the out resurrection takes
        
        52
        place, he goes up there and just battles left and right and kicks Lucifer and all of his demons
        clear out of there. And that clears the whole atmosphere and then the Bride…
         What will happen? Oh, Lord! The resurrected body of the Lord Jesus comes down there
        where Satan was. Glory to God! And we’re caught up to meet Him in the air, to forever be with
        our Lord! Glory to God! Is that right Brother Bingham? Brother Bingham says, “That’s right,
        that is right!” Ain’t that wonderful. And then the dead in Christ shall rise. The dead in Christ
        shall rise and then we’ll all be caught up to meet him in the air! Cause Satan is kicked out of the
        air. And where’s he at?
         All of his demons, and Lucifer himself, is kicked out of the air, where they come back down
        to earth again, and he lands in Rome and lands does the same thing again, comes down in the
        Pope, comes down in the Pope and now was the Beast… Now here is the trail of the serpent
        seed. It was the beast in the beginning… Oh…AND HE COMES DOWN IN THE BEAST IN
        THE END. He incarnates himself in the beast, the Pope, and he rules and reigns over the whole
        earth now.
         Oh my, but the little Bride has done went through the air. Glory to God! And she is at the
        Marriage Supper of the Lamb. Whoo-hoo. Glory to God! Boy, I love it with all my heart. Amen
        and Amen! Amen. Amen! Boy, you talk about a time. (Brother Lambert sings), Caught up to
        meet him in the air!
         Michael and his angels kicked Lucifer and the demons out. The devil, Lucifer, lands in the
        beast, the Pope. Oh, brother! Ya, want a little more on that, do ya!
         Now watch here, now He’s a lost angel. But once he was a saved angel, you know he was in
        the right place. But when he was kicked to earth, he was then a lost angel. And all his third stars
        that followed him are also lost angels, and they are here on the earth, in the Pope and in the
        preachers. Huh! Now, notice, that civilization and these religious demons have traveled from the
        east China come out of Palestine. China and has traveled around here the sun and come down to
        the west. I’m gonna say something. They come down to the west as far as they can go to the
        west. The sun rose in the east, civilization traveled with the sun, and the sun going down and
        civilization comes to the west. And the devil moving all the time with that civilization right! And
        there the third part of all these demons, they’re religious demons, religious to the core. You think
        they don’t know how to preach? Paul said, “Is it any marvel that Satan himself has transformed
        into an ‘apostle of light”
        2 Corinthians 11:13-15-Reference quote:
        13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of
        Christ.
        14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
        15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of
        righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
        The apostles, false prophets. And where did civilization travel? From the east to the west. And
        these lost angels wind up in Los Angeles. Sure! Who was that just passed by?
         Satan thought he fooled us on that one, didn’t he! We got his number boy! There’s the third
        part of them religious spirits in all them cults and isms and false prophets, Brother Branham said,
        “they would wind up on the west coast and it’s called the city of the angels!” GLORY TO GOD!
        Hallelujah! The city of the Lost Angels! Oh, that makes my hair raise up. Ain’t that scary! All
        
        53
        these religious demons get in these preachers and they wind up on the west coast so God CAN
        SINK THEM AND DESTROY THEM.

        65-1204 - The Rapture
        Rev. William Marrion Branham
        190. That same Son stood there, one day. He said, "Lazarus, come forth." And a man that been
        dead four days, rotten, his nose fell in, stunk, he came forth. Said: Marvel not at this: for the
        hour is coming, amen, when all that's in the grave will hear the voice of the Son of God, So, it's
        done been spoke. It has to happen like that. There's going to be a Rapture. Oh, my!
        191. I remember, just my last Message in California, where I thought I'd never go back again,
        when I predicted, "Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean. THUS SAITH THE LORD." It will.
        She is done. She is washed. She is finished. What hour? I don't know when, but it will be sunk.
        Right after that, the earthquakes begin to jolt and bow.192. Remember, many of you men
        standing right there, that rock, that day when that Angel came down there. And that Light and
        Fire falling from the Heaven, around the rock where we were standing there. Rocks fell out of
        the mountains, and falling across there. She blasted three times, hard. I said, "Judgment will
        strike the West Coast." Two days after that, Alaska almost sunk. 193. Remember, that same God
        that said that, said, "Los Angeles is doomed." And she is finished. I don't know when. I can't tell
        you. 194. I didn't know I said that. But this brother here, I believe it was… No. One of the
        Mosely's, I believe, had me out on a street out there. I didn't know what it was till I looked back.
        I looked back in Scripture. And Jesus said, "Capernaum, Capernaum, how oft… You that's
        exalted yourself, rather, up into Heaven, shall be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works
        that been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it'd a stood today." And about a hundred and
        fifty years from there, (Sodom had already, in the earth) then Capernaum is in the water, too,
        today. 195. And that same Spirit of God that said all these things, and done all these things, It
        said there, "Oh, city, Capernaum, who called yourself by the name of the Angels, Los Angeles,
        how you've exalted yourself into heaven! The very root and seat of Satan, see, you've exalted
        yourself." 196 PREACHERS, IT'S A GRAVEYARD FOR THEM. GOOD MEN GO THERE
        AND DIE LIKE RATS. What havoc! 197. "You that call yourself by the name of the Angels; if
        the mighty works had been done in Sodom, that been done in you, it'd stood today. But your
        hour has come.
         Listen to the prophesy, “Oh, thou the city that calls yourselves by the city of the angels,
        YOU’VE EXALTED YOURSELF TO HEAVEN… OH, GLORY TO GOD DON’T LET THIS
        PASS YOU BY!!!!
        Isaiah 14:13-15
        13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the
        stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
        14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
        15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
        
        54
        Daniel 5:23-28-Reference quote:
        23 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his
        house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in
        them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which
        see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy
        ways, hast thou not glorified:
        24 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
        25 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
        26 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished
        it.
        27 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
        28 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
         OH, CHILDREN RAISE YOUR HANDS AND PRAISE HIM, RAISE YOUR HANDS
        AND PRAISE GOD! THAT’S THE LORD, I DIDN’T MEAN TO SAY THAT, THAT WAS
        GOD! My Lord Have mercy!! Oh, children do you realize what I just said? Don’t you know that
        wasn’t me!! That wasn’t me I didn’t know that! That was the Lord. How many felt the Lord
        when he come in here? That wasn’t Brother Bob that said that, that was the Lord!
         See there let’s watch that and go back there and get that! City that…Now, what made them
        call that city see, Los… look how the Devil hid that. LOS, they didn’t put the t on it. But the
        Lord told me the other day, Lost Angeles. Boy, I tell ya! Lost Angels. Now look here, now watch
        here, now I didn’t know that the prophesy said that, and then the Lord let me say that. Oh God…
        my heart is just pounding. Do you realize how fearful and terrible this is children? All them
        preachers out there thinking they’re saved, and they’re lost angels. See, they’re demon possessed
        by them one third part of them religious spirits that was kicked out of heaven. They’re demon
        possessed by them spirits. That’s why they fight Brother Branham that’s why they fight this
        message and everything, and Gods got them all on the west coast that’s where they’re all at. And
        that why it’s called Lost Angeles. Now let’s go back to that prophecy again where the Lord done
        that there. Thou the city that calls yourself by the name of the angels, thou hast exalted thyself to
        the heavens, what is that? That is Lucifer has went up and exalted himself in heaven over the
        stars of God. To be worship above the Lord God.
         Let’s go over here. How many just stay a few more minutes. Now let’s look in Thessalonians
        just a minute. My, my children, oh my how we ought to appreciate this supernatural God in our
        midst. My Lord! Now let’s read in, Second Thessalonians the 2nd chapter 3rd verse. Now, let’s
        watch these same angels. Watch this Lucifer and his angels here.
        2 Thessalonians 2:3-4-Scripture Ad Lib Reading;
        3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling
        away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
        4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that
        he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
         “3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a
        falling away” Talking about the coming of the Lord Jesus. “for that day shall not come, except
        there come a falling away first,” Falling away from the revelation. “and that man of sin be
        
        55
        revealed, the son of perdition.” That’s the devil! That’s the devil everything about him is going
        to be revealed by the Son of Man. Right! Who is exposing him tonight? That’s the Son of man,
        exposing the devil. Watch here now. “4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself…” There he is, thou
        has exalteth thyself in heaven…“above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he
        as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God”.
         See, these demons, one third part of these demons gets in these people and they think they’re
        worshiping the Lord and they’re worshipping Satan.
         Now you know nobody is gonna say, I worship you Satan, I’m in your church, no he deceives
        them. Now see now we couldn’t get on all that, but now just to show you there how that fits right
        in there. Oh, thou city that calls yourself by the city of angels, lost angels. You’ve exalted
        yourself to heaven, through all these preachers and all your great deliverance ministry’s and all
        of ya, you’ve exalted yourself to heaven, but you’re going to be brought down to hell, I’m gonna
        sink ya. I got you all out here now and now you’re on the west coast and you’re in the city of
        Lost Angels and your lost, you preachers. Now one day they’re gonna hear that. God’s gonna put
        his finger on it, your lost. Don’t you realize it’s awesome and fearful, ain’t it! And how thankful
        you ought to be to be in a place like you’re tonight! How would you like to be in Los Angeles in
        one of those deliverance ministries sitting out there under? You could very well been there,
        Brother (Author) Graybill We could very well be out there. How many of them have you all set
        under? Let me finish this up here. How many would like me to finish up here? Do you appreciate
        His presence?
         All right now let’s watch here. Verse 11.
        Revelation 12:11-12-Scripture Reading;
        11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and
        they loved not their lives unto the death.
        12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth
        and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that
        he hath but a short time.
         A short time, he’s got three and one-half years. And then the Lord Jesus is coming from
        heaven with ten thousand of his saints riding on white horses. And they take Lucifer and what
        demons he has left, and puts them into a pit with a chain on it with a lid on it. Now that’s not just
        a lid you just pick up, but he chains the devil with a chain of circumstances. He ain’t got no way
        that he can move any more he’s exposed. So, he’s just waiting for annihilation. He’s got one
        more job to do, so he waits one thousand years Lucifer does he waits one thousand years chained
        with a chain of circumstances. Because the Lord God is on earth and he can’t do nothing no
        more. He’s done his job now he’s chained with a chain. Now at the end of a thousand years,
        Satan and his demons are loosed again for a short time, to go out and deceive Gog and Magog.
        Gog and Magog is the nation’s china and Russia, I believe that come down to battle against
        Jerusalem and there God destroys them with fire from heaven. Now I’m gonna finish this up
        here.
        Revelation 12:13-14-Scripture Reading;
        13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which
        brought forth the man child.
        
        56
        14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the
        wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the
        face of the serpent.
         Now you got to watch that, that’s a real tricky text. Now he’s going back again to the Christ
        child that came forth from the Church. In the beginning that was caught up to the throne. And
        then the woman, the church, fled into the wilderness and came on the Mayflower fled from the
        Roman Empire came to America where there was no land and the earth swallowed them up.
         Now, of course, this is not my Revelation, that’s Brother Branham’s teaching on that. You’ll
        find that on some of his tapes.
         Now notice here.
        Revelation 12:15-16-Scripture Ad Lib Reading;
        15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause
        her to be carried away of the flood.
        16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the
        flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
         “15 And the serpent cast out.” Now he’s going to something else, this goes back and forth
        with those two times he was kicked out of heaven. … “and the serpent cast out of his mouth
        water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.
        “16And the earth helped the woman,”
         And the earth helped the woman. Now there you are, the earth helped the women. Why?
        Because there were no people over here. Now didn’t that church flee out of ‘bloody Mary’ and
        came over here and we founded America. It was the whole earth here and just a few Indians. The
        earth just swallowed us up, they couldn’t martyr us no more. How many know the history of
        America? Brother Branham typed those days to the Mayflower landing, Mayflower.
         Now notice here, 17th verse.
        Revelation 12:17-Scripture Ad Lib Reading;
        17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her
        seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
         “17And the dragon was wroth with the woman...” Now we’re going back…now we’re going
        back where we are right now. “And the dragon was wroth with the woman…” The church.
        “And went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and
        have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”
         Now here, let’s watch this a minute. Brother Branham if you get his teaching on the hundred
        and forty-four thousand, but I don’t know if he placed it like this, but I believe it is the way it is.
         Now notice here, that when the Bride goes into heaven, the devil is angry and gone mad.
        Because he knows he only has three and a half years, and he’s mad at this Bride. He’s mad at this
        Bride, because this bride has exposed him. And what the ministry of the Bride has done, has
        called out a multitude of which no man can number out of the denominations. All of God’s
        people they’re not born again, and they don’t have God’s spirit, but they are God’s people. They
        just missed the oil; the foolish virgins missed the oil. They’re virgins, they’re God’s people and
        
        57
        they come out. All this is classified as foolish virgins. And the Bride… the Bible said, the spirit
        and the Bride say come, come out of there.
        Revelation 22:17-Reference quote:
        17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that
        is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
        And with great power and great authority, the Bride, with Michael, the archangel, and those
        ministering angels and the great power of the Holy Ghost, and the apostolic Word, gives off such
        a display of the power of God that all of those people come out of them denominations. And that
        is the church.
         Now notice when Brother Branham typed it out this way, and it’s the best way I know of too.
        When you women is gonna make you a dress you get a piece of material and you lay that pattern
        down and you lay that pattern the paper the pattern down on the material, and you take the
        scissors and you cut around the pattern. And the pattern that you cut out is the material that
        makes the dress, that’s the Bride! But the material that’s left over is the foolish virgins, the
        church. How many understand it?

        60-1211M - The Ten Virgins, And The Hundred And Forty-Four Thousand Jews William
        Marrion Branham
        182 Now, let me catch it again here, it is the remnant. Now look! Here is a piece of goods. All
        right, the lady lays it out like this. Now she’s going to make herself something, you know, some
        kind of a garment. Now, this is all of the—of the goods she’s got. Now, every bit of it is the same
        kind of goods. That right? 183 Both of them were virgins. See? All right. They had faith in
        Christ, form of godliness, went to church, done good things, charity, nothing could be said
        against their works and things. “I know thy works,” He said in every age. “I know thy works, but
        yet thou lackest.” See? 184 Now, when the woman…she makes up in her mind which way she
        has a pattern here, and she makes up in her mind which way she is going to cut this pattern, what
        it’s going to be cut from. Is that right? Well, she gets what she thinks is the sufficient and best
        part of the—of the pattern. Is that right? ’Cause it’s all the same goods, but she lays it like this
        maybe or like that, she lays it down. Then she takes her scissors and she cuts it out. Now, what’s
        left over is called “remnant.” All right. Now, what is this pattern? How was it known? By the
        one…THE PLACE THAT THE LADY ELECTED TO CUT IT FROM. 185 God, before the
        foundation of the world, Who knew the end from the beginning by foreknowledge, He elected
        where to cut. He knowed the difference between Esau and Jacob. He knowed the difference
        between sinner and saint. He knowed difference. He knows the motive of every heart, so He
        elected us before the foundation of the world and put our names on the Lamb’s Book of Life;
        and also the Lamb that was to be slain (and put our names on before He was slain), and the
        Bible said that Christ was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world. And our names
        were put on the Book when He—when He was elected back there to be the Lamb to be slain,
        we were elected to be the one that He was slain for. See it? 186 Now, it’s all virgin. Now, here’s
        the little remnant, not throwed away. Oh, no. She keeps it, but lays it back, she can use it for
        something else. See? But it’s not going to be used there, that’s the Church cut out. Now, they’ll
        have to stand the judgment (because they go through the Tribulation), that is the remnant.
        
        58
        Now you get it? 187 Here goes the Church, Home, it goes Home. Here is the remnant that’s left
        over. And here is the hundred and forty-four thousand on Mount Sinai, the Jews. It’s not three
        different brides. Huh! It’s the Bride; the remnant; and the hundred and forty-four thousand.
        Exactly. He wasn’t eating nothing but Holy Ghost Food out there, I suppose, so he was all right,
        wasn’t nothing wrong with John. See? And there—there they are.
         Now, notice that the church does not go in the rapture, the Bride does. The church stays here
        during the tribulation, and the devil is mad at the Bride. The Bride escapes in the rapture and
        now the devil comes down with great anger and great madness and what does he do? He takes
        off after the seed of the woman. I said, the seed! Hello! I said, he takes off after the seed of the
        woman. Which is the remnant, the remnant of the material that’s left over from the Bride. The
        Pope, the devil, Lucifer and the pope, and all of his demons now takes off after the church, the
        foolish virgins, and they begin to martyr them, and also the Jews. They take off after the church
        and the Jews and begins to martyr them.
         Now notice here. That’s goes to show you right there, that the Bride of Christ is gonna plant a
        seed in those people that came out of those churches.
        That’s what I’ve been waiting for you to get that. Now how many see it now? Now it goes to
        show you right there that the Bride has got a ministry.

        60-0925 - That Day On Calvary
        William Marrion Branham
        129 Now notice. The “greater” works, was to have the Power in the Church, not only to heal
        the sick by prayer, cast out devils by prayer, but to impart Eternal Life to believers. The Holy
        Ghost was coming, and given into the hands of the Church, to impart Life. Oh! That’s what
        Calvary meant. It took stooped, degraded men and women, and lifted them into a place, to be
        sons and daughters of God, to heal the sick and to impart Eternal Life; by giving the Holy
        Ghost to obedient believers, men who were once unbelievers, be made believers, and impart
        spiritual, Eternal Life. How much greater is it, to say…130 This sick woman laying here, I can
        pray a prayer of faith and she’ll be healed. That’s a great thing. That’s what He was doing then.
        131 “But,” said, “greater than this shall you do. I’m going to give you Power, not only to raise
        him up for a while, but to give him Eternal Life, which will be Eternal, forever.” Poor, blind,
        wretched people, how do you miss that? Don’t you see what the “greater” thing is? THAT’S
        THE GREATEST THING COULD EVER HAPPEN, WAS TO IMPART ETERNAL LIFE
        TO PEOPLE. WHAT IS ETERNAL LIFE? THE LIFE THAT HE LIVED, THE LIFE THAT
        WAS IN HIM, IMPART THAT TO OTHERs. Can a man do that? A son of God can. 132 Jesus
        said, “Whose soever sins you remit, to them they are remitted; whose soever sin you retain, to
        them they are retained.”

        60-1204M - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
        William Marrion Branham
        142 “Upon this rock I’ll build my church, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against.” 143
        So then you see why Satan is so against the Book of Revelation. Anything that’s revealed,
        spiritual revelation, Satan is against it. That’s why he’s so against the ministry today. Because,
        what is it? The revealing of Christ. 144 Let the church go on with its great denominations and
        organizations, and its little flowery messages and so forth. Let them go on, Satan won’t bother
        that. They don’t have no troubles. Everybody pats them on the back. 145 When there comes a
        time that God, through the Holy Ghost, reveals Christ back in the Church, with the power and
        demonstrations of healing the sick, and making the signs that He said would follow the
        believers, come to pass, then Satan turns over in his bed. He does something about it. Until
        that time, Satan don’t care how much church you join. He don’t care how much. But when
        Christ reveals to you that He is the Son of God, and the works that He did you do also; not
        some other works, but the same works. 146 “He that believeth in me…” Saint John 14:7. “He
        that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he also. Do the same works, and greater than
        this.” Because, Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost, would be greater. He
        could not bring it to them, because the Holy Ghost hadn’t yet been given. BUT WHEN JESUS
        CAME AND SACRIFICED HIS LIFE, AND THE HOLY GHOST RETURNED, THEN
        THEY COULD IMPART ETERNAL LIFE TO THE PEOPLE. THAT’S THE “GREATER.”
        147 But the signs and wonders, Jesus plainly said, in Mark 16, “Go ye into all the world, and
        preach the gospel to every creature.” How far? All the world. How many? Every creature. Long
        as the Gospel is being preached, these signs shall follow them that believe. And when that
        becomes a revelation, brother, you’re near the Kingdom then. “On this rock I’ll build my
        church, and the gates of hell can’t prevail against it.” 148 Because, the man or the woman
        that’s ever been in that back desert alone, like Moses was, and the revelation of God be made
        manifest to him through the Holy Ghost, there’s nothing can shake him. He’s just as sound and
        solid as he can be. Satan hates Revelation. He don’t like it, at all; upsets his plans.
        
         Notice that in the Bride, the pattern of Christ gives off such a grand display of the power of
        God, and shows up the devil for what he is and brings all them people out of the denominations
        and plants a seed in their minds that denominational World Counsel Churches is the Mark of the
        Beast. And if they stay in there, they’ll be destroyed in a lake of fire forever and ever. And they
        give such a display of the power of God, that they come out of the gates of hell. They come out
        of them prison houses. And then the devil takes off after the seed, that comes from the Bride,
        planted in the foolish virgins. How many see it? Oh marvelous, now Brother Branham was
        gonna to get to that but never did. So, I know that’s right!
         So, we see the spirit in Malachi 4 say come, and the Bride is gonna say, come. And when the
        Bride says come of out of there, she plants a seed in that foolish virgin, but it don’t have time to
        mature and come forth oil. But remember, brother they believe it strong enough in their minds
        that they won’t even…They’ll be cut open, eyes gouged out, heads cut off, martyred, and
        persecuted in every way. But they will not bow down to that. They’ll die without any grace,
        without any power, and without any spirit to help them. They see such a display of the real thing
        
        60
        in the Bride of Christ that they will let them do anything they want to with them, but they never
        will accept that Mark of the Beast!
         Oh my, children, how you ought to love the Lord God with all our heart and all your soul, and
        all our might, just to think you could be in here hearing and have a chance to get the oil now.
        Cause the little Bride comes out… the seed the little Bride plants a seed in them foolish virgins,
        to come out. And they will try to get the oil…
         Now, hold it now! They come and say to the Bride, give us of your oil! Please help us to get
        this token! And she will say, I’m sorry, we don’t have time, the rapture is ready to take place,
        see. And you don’t have time to come up that ladder. Said, but now stay with this, don’t accept
        the Mark of The Beast. Now, the rapture will take place, we’ll be gone, but don’t you accept that
        Mark of the Beast. And they hang onto that, brother hang on to that sister right through all that
        bloody persecution from the Pope. He’ll just ride, kill and murder, cut heads of, and rip and tear.
        It’s going to be awful.
         How many going to be glad to meet him in the air? (Amen) Now, that’s awful chopped up,
        that’s awful the way I brought that out. I sure hope you see it. I sure hope God puts that down in
        your heart and you’ll hunger and thirst after him and draw near him, cause now all that winds up
        real quick.
         How many glad you ain’t out in lost angels (Los Angeles, CA). I’m glad I’m right here where
        I’m at. It will plunge beneath the ocean and there will be the awful’est disaster. Brother Branham
        said, it’ll be worse than the days of Pompeii when they had the earthquake there. God will sink
        them preachers for the way that they’ve done.
         Now let’s sing a hymn.
         As long as you get the revelation that’s what I want. Now, children let me say something to
        you. Now you’re going to have to… whatever you do, don’t forget this. You listen to those
        things till you get them in your heart. You go over that and you listen till you get it in your heart.
         Now the revelation is just about finished here. I’ve done tied the whole Bible together, there’s
        nothing that I can see now except A BIG TEST FOR YOU!

        An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age William
        Marrion Branham
        Now remember that Moses was born for a certain work, but he could not do that work until he
        had received the gifts which would enable him to do the work. He had to go out in the desert
        and wait there; God had an appointed time. There was to be a certain Pharaoh on the throne,
        and the people had to be crying for the bread of life, before God could send him back. This is
        true for our day. But what do we have in this our day? Multitudes are working signs until we
        have a generation of sign seekers that know little or nothing about the Word, or a true move of
        the Spirit of God. If they see blood, oil and fire they are happy; it matters not what is in the
        Word. They will support any sign, even unscriptural ones. But God has warned us about that. He
        said in Matthew 24 that in the last days the two spirits would be so close together that only the
        very elect could tell them apart, for they alone would not be deceived. How can you tell the
        spirits apart? Just give them the Word test. If they don’t speak that Word, they are of the evil
        one. As the evil one deceived the first two brides, he will try to deceive the bride of this last day,
        by trying to get her to hybridize herself through creeds, or just plainly turning from the Word
        to any sign that suits her. But God never placed signs ahead of the Word. Signs follow the
        Word, as when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first, according to the Word of
        the Lord. WHEN SHE DID AS THE WORD SAID, THE PROPER SIGN CAME. COME TO
        THE WORD FIRST AND THEN WATCH THE MIRACLE. THE SEED WORD IS
        ENERGIZED BY THE SPIRIT. How can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of
        the Word and deny some of it? The true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole
        Word. Denominations will hate him. His words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who
        called them vipers. But the predestinated will hear and be ready for the rapture. The Royal
        Seed of Abraham, with like faith as Abraham’s will hold to the Word with him, for they are
        predestinated together. The last-day messenger will appear in God’s appointed time. It is the
        end time now as all know, for Israel is in the homeland. Any time now he will come according to
        Malachi. When we see him, he will be dedicated to the Word. He will be indicated (pointed out in
        the Word, Revelation 10:7), and God will vindicate his ministry. He will preach the truth as did
        Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion showdown. Many will misunderstand him because they
        have been taught Scripture in a certain way which they consider truth. When he comes against
        that, they will not believe. Even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because
        so much has been called God’s truth by deceivers.
        But this prophet will come, and as the forerunner to the first coming cried, “Behold the
        Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world,” even so will he no doubt cry out, “Behold
        the Lamb of God, coming in glory.” He will do this, for even as John was the messenger of
        truth to the elect, so is this one the last messenger to the elect and Word-born bride.

        SOMEWHERE, HE NEVER COME BACK. He probably went to the woods, a hunting. He just
        never returned no more.
         Los Angeles…Los Angeles will go under any time. And when it does, I believe with all my

         So, now she almost went the last time. She’s been quivering and shaking ever since that one.
        She’s had several tremors. People scared to death out there, but any time this great thing could
        start. And it won’t…. it’ll be so quick and powerful and just knock you off your feet, and then
        it’ll be gone out of America and across the ocean.
         And here you’d be and I’d be gone. You’ll say, “Lord I had all that time and I set there and
        played and fooled around. Now, you ain’t gonna fail, are you? See, can you expect Brother
        Bob… can you expect Brother Bob to keep going on preaching great revelations for years, and
        years, and years? I can’t! See, there is an end to that. There’s some time there’s an end. Now as
        far as I can see… I tell you, if you believe me to be God’s servant, you’ve have the Revelation
        here.
         Oh, you say, what about that rapturing faith? Honey, you better go back and search the tapes,
        you’ve missed something. If you ain’t found what you need by now, you better go back and
        listen, you’ve missed somewhere! It went in your head not in your heart. Now you go back and
        you listen. And if you don’t understand, you go back there and listen, till you find it. How many
        is gonna do that? See, all the Revelation is out, see. You say, “What about them thunders?” Go
        back and listen to them tapes, go back there. And if your spiritual, and you go back there and you
        keep listening you’ll find something. Then you get that in your heart. Then you’ll be ready.
        But you got to get it down in your heart - this great thing.
         Did you know when that starts it may not last six months? Six months and cover the earth in
        six months and the rapture take place. In six months, in other words, let’s say before I leave this
        building that the Lord God could start that tonight. Within six months the rapture would take
        place and the dead in Christ would rise, and we’d be going to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.
        
        63
         Now, there’s gonna be many that’s gonna weep and wail, and cry to find something, and
        can’t. So, we don’t want to let God’s great grace and the things that’s he’s done, his great
        presence and great Revelation, and revealed all those things, we don’t want that… “Well, now
        praise the Lord, Brother Bob will be preaching Sunday.” You got to do something, you’re not

        240 But if our heart condemn us not; if we know that we’re walking in the commandments of
        God; we see our lives cleaned up; we see it; every Word that God commanded, we keep It; then
        the gates of every enemy is possessed. “Then ask what you will, it’ll be done for you.” “He shall
        possess the gate of his enemy.” Oh, brother, what a church that would be! 241 When I come
        back again to Phoenix, if the Lord permits me, I hope, when I walk into this tabernacle, that
        these pews will be lined, and every pew in the full Gospel movement in this city will be lined with
        saints of the living God: look like Christian; talk like Christian; act like Christians; with the
        Spirit of God moving among them, where, if one would sin, the Holy Spirit call it out right then.
        242 It’ll do it. You seen it in the prayer line, as up here on the altar. Where, say, “You go back
        there and make that right with your husband. Go, tell your wife that you was out, night before
        last, with that woman, setting on a certain-certain place.” If It’ll do it here, by walking in the
        Word, listening to that still small Voice, It’ll do it in you. You’re Abraham’s Seed. Then, no sin.
        243 Preacher, wouldn’t you like to see that in your church? Walk in this church, and look down
        along through here, see both men and women, godly, saintly, setting there just charged with the
        power of God. Sin could not walk in. A man walk in and set down, the Spirit raise up and say,
        “John Jones, you come from so-and-so, a city, a certain-certain place. He’s here to find healing
        for his body. See? He did a certain thing at a certain place. He did this, and he take…has, take
        this back, make this right, then God will heal him of that cancer. THUS SAITH THE LORD.”
        My, my! 244 Give me a church, give me ten men, who, really jewels of God, the Royal Seed,
        put them men together, and watch what’ll take place. Give me this little houseful of people like
        that, and I’ll show you a Light that the world will run to it. That’s right. That’s what God
        wants us to be. “You’re a city setting on a hill.” You’re Royal Seed of Abraham. “It shall
        possess the gate of its enemy.” 245 Sickness, there’s a cause for sickness. There’s a cause for
        these things. And God, the Holy Spirit, is here to reveal that thing and tell you why you don’t get
        it. WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH US? We don’t have to wonder, “Will It do it.” It’s already
        doing it. WHAT DO YOU DO? 246 Watch that prophet. He listened not to the rushing wind,
        “Glory to God! Hallelujah!” 247 That’s good. Now, remember, I’m not condemning that. I hope
        everybody understands that. Somebody said, “Brother Branham don’t believe in saying, ‘Glory
        to God! Hallelujah!’” Well, look at me up here now. I believe in shouting, speaking with
        tongues, dancing in the Spirit. 248 BUT, BROTHER, WHEN YOU FAIL TO HEAR THAT
        STILL SMALL VOICE OF THE WORD, THAT’S THE THING.

        what’s happened in that much time. Just watch it, how it’s going to keep faster and faster. We’re
        at the end. We’re living in the shadows of His Coming. 100 “And there will be signs in the
        heavens above and in the earth. Men’s hearts failing; fear, perplexed of time; distress between
        the nations.” “How the people will be heady, high-minded!” “How the daughters of Zion, the
        church, would walk haughty, high-minded; with the way she’d walk, and mince and twist as
        she went.” 101 Where we at? We’re with Belteshazzar’s big rock-and-roll party. And the
        church has been caught in the tide, through television, through radio, through Hollywood.
        And there we are. Real Christian women bobbing off their hair, wearing make-up on their
        faces, dressing in little old dirty clothes, because reprobate people has told them there’s no
        harm in it. 102 A Christian woman, preacher, sent a girl down here the other day, looked like
        she was poured into her clothes. She said, “Oh, Brother Branham, you’re from the old school.
        Our pastor liberates women.” I said, “Liberate them from what?” 103 They’re liberating them
        from Christ and common decency. Oh, very famous, the woman is. Certainly. But anything that
        does that is a child of hell. “By their fruits you shall know them.” What a day we are living in!
        Sure. I don’t believe…know it says how, what kind of clothes you wear, and so forth. But,
        woman, do you realize what you’re doing? You’re making yourself a sex mark to every old
        scalawag rascal that comes by. But you want liberation. It shows what spirit that’s in you. You
        want to get free from Church, free from Christ, free from the Holy Spirit, so you can live like the
        rest of them. That don’t exclude the Branham Tabernacle. That includes the Branham
        Tabernacle, all! “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” Here we are. OH,
        WHAT A DAY! WHAT A TIME! 104 AND HE’S ALL SHOOK UP. AND HE LOOKED,
        AND OVER AGAINST THE WALL THERE WAS A PART OF A MAN’S HAND. AND IT
        WAS WRITING ON THE WALL, “MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.”
         Let’s sing, “There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood.
         I’m so thankful for that blood tonight. Boy, it kinda scares me about Los Angeles there. Oh,
        my Lord, I’m so glad I know the truth, I don’t know what to do. Think about it, being out there
        all stirred up and preaching tonight and you got your big building, got your books, got your big
        truck, you got your tent, and don’t know it but you’re a lost angel. Lost angels!
        Congregation sings. “There is a Fountain Filled with Blood”
        
        65
         Man, I love that blood song, but I don’t like that part about laying in the grave. I don’t even
        like to sing that. Brother and sister, I ain’t going to no grave. I’m gonna be caught up to meet
        him in the air. He’s gonna clear the atmosphere out for me, and I’m gonna meet the one I love,
        not only meet His spirit down here, but I’m gonna meet His resurrected body in the air. I’m
        gonna see what kind of body He came in. A little lowly Lord Jesus, and I believe when you see
        Him your gonna see a little fella. I believe He weighs about a hundred and thirty- five pounds
        and He’s about five feet eight. I believe it’s gonna be the prettiest face, it ain’t beauty like the
        world’s beauty. But when I looked into it, it was the prettiest face I ever seen. And I tell you if
        he’d held still, I sure would have got a hold of him. I wept and cried many nights and my eyes
        would be all swollen together and be sore from cryin you know. I said, “I want to see Him. I’ll
        die if I don’t see what you look like.” I’d wrestle with Him make love with Him way up till the
        morning, and I’d be just exhausted till I couldn’t cry no more, my ole eyes all swollen together. I
        was a mess, then it was years later, He let me see Him.
         Oh, it was just so wonderful! I looked, and sat where you see the green chair in my study. I
        got one little dim light I put on and I sit and meditate at night. I look there and I see Him, cause I
        know what He looks like now, and I just look at that profile them angels. I can just see Him and I
        sit there and look at Him. And oh my, just a little ole tinny face, little ole teeny fella, real thin
        chestnut hair that goes down to his shoulders, real thin hair and a little mustache, black
        mustache, real thin beard, about like Brother Gatlian’s or maybe a little darker, and coming down
        like that. Just a little fella. But, oh my, friends what will it be when we look upon him there. Just
        oh… my…
         And there, when your caught up in the rapture now, you’ll be traveling like a thought. I say by
        the grace of God humbly I seen that rapture and being caught up; you know. And it was just
        great power and you were just traveling like a thought you know. And then I was traveling like
        that and looked up, and there He was standing there with His hands out, and all them saints
        popping up all around you there, see. And there He is with His hands stretched out. And then you
        go up a little higher to meet Him in the air, and then He leads us right into heaven. See, where
        we’ll go to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb for three and one-half years.
         Oh, how many just want to be there with all your heart? (Amen) Now see, oh if we can just
        pray and read His Word. See, if you can love His revealed Word, then you’re in good shape,
        because that’s the Bridegroom. The bridegroom is the revealed Word of God and if you can love
        that revealed Word of God, that’s Him! Now that’s a sure sign that He’s coming after you, if you
        love the revealed Word. Course you say, “Well, boy that’s pretty good, that sounds alright.” No,
        see, you got to be in love with Him. It’s got to mean more than anything in the world. Just in
        love with that revealed Word of God. You’re hungering and thirsty, oh God, I want You to
        come.
         And then somebody will say and cryin “Oh Lord, I want You to come.” And then someone
        says, “well that scares me, I don’t want him to come.” Goes to Show you there something ain’t
        right, see. You just gotta just be oh if He said, “I’m coming between now and daylight.” See, that
        ought to just thrill you to death, just thrill you to death. Lord, Lord! See, you’ve got to have it
        that way. How many want it that way down in your heart? Even so, come Lord Jesus.
         Now let’s bow our heads. I know I’ve done said so many things today, and I know it just
        wears your mind out, and I know you’re just wore out. And our bodies ain’t got no strength no
        more. We go to bed and we get up and we’re just as tired as we was when we went to bed. But
        that’s gonna change real shortly. All this ole depression and demon power, depression now.
        Brother when Michael manifests his self and in these Angels, it’s gonna be deliverance in Zion.
        
        66
        All these great things will be taking place. Now your little heart gets sad, but what sadness you
        got friend, is gonna be turned into joy. You’ll be turned into joy. And you’ve not asked much
        hither to before, but now you’ll ask anything in my name and I will do it. I will do it. Whatever
        you ask I’ll give it to you. Oh, what a great glorious thing He’s gonna do for His little Bride.
        Lord, hasten that great day.
        John 16:20-Reference quote:
        20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and
        ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
        21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is
        delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the
        world.
        22 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and
        your joy no man taketh from you.
        23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall
        ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
        24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be
        full.
         Now with our heads bowed and our eyes closed. While our sister plays a chorus, softly, Jesus
        Is the Sweetest Name I know, play that’ll be alright.
         Lost angels, Lost angels.
         Now with every head bowed and every eye closed. Now, if there is some here tonight, you
        know that you’re not in love with the Bridegroom, you don’t really down in your heart up in
        your head you kinda do, but down in your heart you don’t know if you’re really in love with the
        Bridegroom, or not. You say, “Brother Bob, that kinda tonight struck fear in my heart, and oh I
        see Los Angeles and all these things your saying, I want to be right with the Lord. I want to
        know that revealed Word and be in love with that Bridegroom and you say, would you pray for
        me brother Bob?”
         God bless all those hands; He sees your hands. Just think, He loves you, you’re the apple of
        His eye. Now you know what an apple of your eye is, that’s the biggest most beautiful apple that
        is hanging in the tree and you’re that apple of His eye. That’s what Proverbs said, the apple of
        His eye. And He’s coming to gather the apples of His eye unto Himself. And He’s gonna let the
        world know He’s loved you. And He’s gonna make the denominations ashamed that they put
        Him on the outside.

        Closing Prayer: By Brother Robert Lambert:
         Dear Heavenly father, now God, you’ve been in our midst this morning in a great way. Your
        power of Revelation, and your great presence was here this morning. And now Lord, God these
        fearful things jump out of us here, and we see that how perfect it fits right into the scriptures, and
        right into what you’re doing in this hour.
         God maybe the world would make fun of us, if they could see us. Maybe we look funny and
        peculiar. But, oh Lord, we know that you’re in our midst. And we know that Thou art revealing
        thy Word to us. And we pray heavenly father God, that Lord Jesus, you’d bless every hand here
        that was up lifted tonight.
         God, I pray that the people may love that Word with all of their hearts until they can become
        the Word, Lord. Oh, Father, help us to be ready at any hour God that you would come and seal
        us. That we may we be ready.
         Lord, bless every girl, every man here, and every woman every child. Father, may not one
        miss it. Lord may not one miss it. Oh, Father, may you have preeminence in our lives you may
        have first place. And Lord, we don’t want to save our lives, we don’t want no life here, Lord.
        We’re laying down our lives, we’re laying down our lives that we might find it again, oh God in
        a new world to come. God bless everyone here tonight father.
         And Lord may this week God may you bless each one. Be with them on their job. God, they
        work out there among all that demon power and devils Lord, I pray that you’ll bless them, give
        them strength, lead them, and guide them by your Holy Spirit.
         And we pray Father, for the little Bride all over the world. We pray that thy great minister, the
        Son of Man, God hidden and revealed in human flesh, and the angels of God, the Third Pull, may
        it go forth Lord and bring your Bride into the unity of the Revelation under the statue of a perfect
        man and under the sealing of the capstone. That God, that we may leave the earth and go to our
        honeymoon in the sky.
         Heavenly father, how we pray God that thou would bless your unworthy minister, Lord God.
        Come Lord, and do the thing that thou has promised to do in this hour.
         Bless all your little ministers all over the country Lord those that believe thy Revelation, and
        those that are gonna believe on thy Revelation Bless them father. And may you come and put all
        enemies under thy feet. For we ask it in Jesus’ name, amen.
         Alright, take the name of Jesus with you.
         How many is going away in strength tonight? My just think Brother, if that would slip under
        tonight. Just think, it almost did a few days ago. Think what it’ll do. Then the hour is right upon
        us, right then. Oh, help us to fear and reverence the Lord with all our hearts. Take that name with
        you, now!

       Brother Lambert prays opening prayer:
        Remain standing. Let’s bow our heads in a word of prayer.
       Great faithful God, we’re thankful to be here again this morning, and to have life with in our
       bodies Lord. That we could be living in this glorious hour. To see thy great faithfulness to thy
       word of promise in this hour. We thank you Lord for all the people here, that you’ve led here
       from across the countries Lord. They have come here father to see thy great faithfulness and thy
       mighty hand stretched forth in this hour. We thank thee for the great power of the revelation of
       thy word. And we thank you Lord that we are planted, by the rivers of living water father that’s
       gonna bring forth your fruit in the prophet’s season. God we’re so thankful to be living in the
       season of the prophet’s Lord. God we’re so thankful to be living in the hour when we’re
       returning to the power of Pentecost father, to usher in the great millennium. Oh, God we pray
       that you’ll bring these things to pass Lord quickly in our lives. Father may the earth see the glory
       of God. May the earth see the real manifestations of the sons and daughters of the living God.
       Father God, stir our souls this morning and establish us upon the rock. Take away every bit of
       tossing and every bit of turning Lord. And God help our compass Lord, to point to the north star
       Jesus Christ in whom there is no variableness neither shadow of turning Lord. Oh, we thank you
       for the unmovable Christ. We thank you this morning father. For Jesus Christ the Lamb of God,
       that takes away the sin of unbelief Lord. Oh God, may the power of Christ get into the word and
       cut open the hearts this morning Lord. Circumcise away every unbelief Lord, every bit of
       unbelief. Lord God sand us and hone us down Lord, to fit the great capstone. God bless us this
       morning. Those that are sick and afflicted God may they be healed by the presence of God this
       morning. God help the people to realize who it is that’s standing among us today. My God that
       the cripples could get up and walk away and every sickness melt away at the presence of Jesus
       Christ. The captain of the host is here father, we pray that you’d help us to realize, who we are
       and what thou hast done for us father. Help us Lord to be established in the word of God. In
       Jesus name, we ask it. Amen.
        You may be seated. We have a baby to dedicate this morning. I certainly thank the Lord for
       the growth of my assembly. Brother Bill, it’s awful little. Let’s bow our heads please. Oh my,
       ain’t that precious! What’s its name? William Jeremy. Let us pray. Father I thank you for this
       precious little bundle of joy. Father I thank you for Judy and Brother Bill. I thank you for their
       marriage and for you bringing them together, for it seemed so fit before the world was ever
       created. You saw this little William Jeremy, father before there ever was a speck of star dust
       Lord in the sky, Lord thank you for this healthy baby. Thank you for your presence God that we
       feel here around this dedication. And I pray God, as your unworthy servant your unworthy
       minister I pray that you’ll bless this precious little William Jeremy Lord. Lord there’s not many
       days left, but I pray thy blessings upon this little child. May it be holy and anointed of the holy
       spirit. God keep sickness away from it, let no plague come nigh this little child father. Oh, bless
       this little one Lord and bless its precious darling mother and daddy Lord. And may they grow
       
       2
       and strive into the very image of Christ. God may their home never have one sad hard spirit or
       attitude Lord, but may it be filled with joy of the holy ghost. In Jesus name, I pray. Amen.
       That sure is precious, I’d just soon go on holding him, it feels pretty good. He’s not much bigger
       than a football.
        How many love the Lord Jesus? (Amen) How may is thankful for his presence? (Amen) So
       thankful to God that we could assemble ourselves together and feel the presence of the Holy
       Spirit. That’s wonderful!
        Now I’d like us to open our Bibles to Romans 8:1. I have a real…I just feel this morning that
       some of the things I might say might be a little rough, hard, but I don’t mean it that way, it’s just
       too…It’s kinda like a carpenter you know, just nail it down real good and tight so the wind won’t
       blow it away. Because what we’re building today, we don’t want the wind to blow it away, we
       want it to hold real tight.
        And I think the only thing that’s gonna stand in this hour, is men and women that have come
       face to face with truth. Face to face with truth and then look it over and say, “That’s it” and then
       let everything else pass away. Because you really, never come this way before you see. How
       many know that you’ve never come this way before? (Amen) And Gods bringing you a new way
       and so therefore we become the children of God because we could stand his chastisement and
       take the word of God. And that’s what the Lord Jesus is pleased with, see. He’s pleased when
       you smite your breast and say, “Lord be merciful to me a sinner. Lord I just need you so bad. I’m
       just worthless to you.” See, that’s the right attitude, see he’ll bless you.
        And I really believe the reason why that we’re in the shape we’re in today around the country
       following this great prophet’s message, is because of not being honest with the word of God.
       Heavens and earth will pass away but the word of God will never pass away. It’s either the
       infallible word of God or it’s not.
       Matthew 24:35-Reference quote:
       35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
        And if the apostles had their guns zeroed in on a target and it hit a bullseye every time, then
       it’s got to do the same thing today. And if it’s not hitting the bullseye today, then there’s
       something wrong.

       63-0320 - The Third Seal
       William Marrion Branham
       144 “Whosoever shall take one Word away from It, or add one to It.” Hallelujah! Christ wants
       His Wife pure with the Word. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit four times—Ed.] That’s
       the way She must be. 145 Cause, nothing, not one tot, or one jittle, or anything, or tittle, will
       pass from that law, or from that Book, till It’s all fulfilled. Jesus said, “Both heavens and
       earth will pass away, but My Word shall never pass.” 146 Don’t put any private interpretation
       to It. He wants a pure, unadulterated, not even a flirt. I wouldn’t want my wife flirting with
       some other man. And when you go to listening to any kind of reasons, beyond That, you’re
       listening, you’re flirting with Satan. Amen! Don’t it make you feel religious? [Congregation
       says, “Amen.”—Ed.] God wants you to stay unadulterated. Stay right there with that Word. Stay
       right with It. All right. 147 God promised to her, as He did to Eve in the garden of Eden, to this
       
       3
       last Eve here. Which, the pentecostal church, the beginning of the church, the church itself, is
       the mother of all of the living people, because, as long as they go in there. But, you see, when
       they take up her sins, they die with her. 148 Here comes a little fellow along. He say, “I—I want
       to serve God.” 149 They say, “Well, here is what you do. Go down there and repent.” “All right,
       I’ll do it. Glory to God!” Go down there, repent. 150 “Now come join us.” There, there you are.
       Uh-huh. See? That got it. Huh! That’s right, died right with it. See? See? That’s just…That’s
       what this Book is teaching, see, not what I’m saying. Because, It says Here, so. All right. 151
       Now, God has promised her, as He did Eve. He told Eve there would come a time that the—the
       Word would come back to her again. Now you remember that? What she lost from, it would be
       restored. Cause, there’s only one Thing can restore, and that’s the Word. Exactly. 152 I said,
       shoot a gun; if you don’t hit the target, find where it went off at. You got to come back there
       and start again. See? 153 And if you go back, you go to Nicaea. That’s where you start again,
       see. Go back, away from them organizations, away from all that church. And we been seeing
       these Seals just perfectly. 154 I always wondered, all my life, why I was so against
       organizational systems. Not the people, no. The people are just like me or you, or anybody else.
       But that system, that denominational system, now I see it right here. I never knowed it till now.
       And that’s right. 155 God promised the spiritual Eve, the same as He did the natural Eve, that
       again the Word would be restored to her. In the last days He would restore to the Church, to
       the original Word again.
       
        So, I think it’s a duty of me, as a pastor and a minister and your brother, I wouldn’t love you
       if I tried to just pacify you. I wouldn’t love you. But if I truly love you then no matter, it may
       kinda scorch you a little bit and plow your corn a little close. Maybe you’ll get a little irritated
       with me, for saying the things I do, but its only because I love you see. One day it’ll pay off
       down the road.
        So, we’ve got to come to face the facts and then realize the word of God is true and it’ll never
       pass away. And then if we do what the word of God said, God is duty bound to come and be
       faithful. Because great is his faithfulness to his word. He’s got to come to his word, see. And
       that’s what we’re waiting on.
        We’re wiring the building up correctly. Now my house is wired up terribly. Brother Norman
       an electronics man said, “It’s wired up terrible.” And it’s just the grace of God it hasn’t burnt
       down by now. But now I’m not no electrician, but I’m a spiritual electrician. And I want to wire
       this building up correctly. Now so far, I believe we’ve got it wired up just right. But the wiring is
       not complete yet, but when it is the great master electrician will come down and pull the main
       switch. Why is because, he won’t pull it until he knows that every wire, and every facet is right
       in its right place. There’ll be no blowing fuses, he don’t want no blowing fuses no short outs you
       know. He wants everything just right.
        So, that’s why we’re here this morning, to just say the word of God just like it is. And say,
       “That’s it! That’s it!” Just walk right on and then the hour will come, when your wired up just
       right. He knows the hour to pull the switch. You don’t, I don’t, he knows. But he will pull it!
       How many believe it? (Amen) He’ll pull it, he’ll light up this thing as sure as the world.
        Now, I’d like to read from Romans 8:1. I’ll try to just go right through here as quick as I can.
       Romans 8:1. And this is a famous scripture that’s quoted by all religious people. It’s one of the
       most famous scriptures for the Baptist and evangelicals all ministers. I suppose this scripture
       might be quoted more than any other scripture in the Bible, outside of John 3:16.
       
       4
       John 3:16-Reference quote:
       16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
       him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
        And I would like to preach about what I think about this scripture this morning, see.
       I heard it preached one time on a scripture… The radio preachers preached about it and I never
       did preach on it. And that was Romans 9, I believe it was. Yeah it was Romans 9. “If thou shalt
       confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ and believe that God raised him from the dead,
       thou shalt be saved.
       Romans 10:9-Reference quote:
       9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that
       God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
       And I preached what I thought about that. But there is more to it, than just quoting the scripture.
       Every scripture in the Bible you cannot build your foundation on one scripture, one scripture.
       But you must make every scripture dovetail with the rest of the Bible. Then when you dovetail it,
       then that’s God. But you can take any scripture and build a doctrine on it and go out on a limb,
       see. And be just contrary to the will and plan of God.
        Now bare these word in mind! Any man, any man, that’ll take one word away from the divine
       plan of God for this hour for his Bride, is an Antichrist!
       Revelation 22:19-Reference quote:
       19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take
       away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are
       written in this book.
       Don’t say, “But Him” Any Man, Any Man, any preacher, whoever it is that’ll take One Word
       Away! I don’t care how great of a preacher he is! I don’t care if he walked with the prophet, I
       don’t care if he slept with the prophet, ate with the prophet, hunted with the prophet. I don’t care
       who it is, whoever it is, that’ll take one word away from the divine plan, the divine plan for the
       Bride to come to Christ the Bridegroom. Take one word away from that plan, he is an antichrist.
       And if you’ll stay with that, you’ll never falter or fail. But just as sure as you open up your ear to
       reasoning you’ll go; you’ll go away from God. Now how many want to stay with that plan?
       (Amen)
        Now, let’s read our scripture.
       Romans 8:1-Scripture Reading;
       8 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after
       the flesh, but after the Spirit.
       2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
       3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son
       in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
       4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after
       the Spirit.
       
       5
       5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit
       the things of the Spirit.
       6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
       7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
       indeed can be.
       8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
       9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if
       any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
       10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of
       righteousness.
       11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
       from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
       12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
       13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the
       body, ye shall live.
       14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
        Of course, I didn’t need to go on reading all that, but it’s all real good. God’s word is all
       good. Now I’d like to bring a little Sunday school lesson on, “The Bride In The Spirit”
        Now notice here, is two great words I want you to look at in Romans 8 and 1. And that is
       condemnation, the word condemnation and in Christ Jesus. Now notice here, Paul said, “There is
       no condemnation to the believer that has come into Christ Jesus.
        Now there’s only…Now you just have to take it, just like the word of God said. You are
       either in Christ Jesus or you are out of Christ Jesus. You are either in the body or you are out of
       the body. And as long as you are out of the body of Jesus Christ your gonna feel some
       condemnation on you. You will never be free of that condemnation of the devil putting that on
       you all the time. Until you ultimately, come into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
        Now you know my doctrine on that. I do not believe that the material for the Bride has been
       put together yet. I believe the Bride is predestinated on the earth now. The material for the Bride
       is here. And there is a people that’s coming into perfection. I do not believe that they’re in
       perfection now, but they’re coming into perfection.
        And let it be known, there is only three steps to full perfection, and that is Justification…
       Justification your still on the outside of the body. Sanctification your still on the outside of the
       body. But when you become perfect, is when you are Baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus
       Christ. How do we get into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ? Is by one Holy Spirit Baptism.
       1 Corinthians 12:13-Reference quote:
       13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
       we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
       For by one spirit, only one way and by only one spirit can an individual come into the body and
       that’s by the Token, Baptism, Capstone, Seal of God. And he has not come yet. So therefore, we
       can say then that you are on the outside of the body of Jesus Christ. And if the rapture took place,
       you would still sit right there this morning! Because you don’t have in you what it takes to
       translate you into immorality. So how many is gonna say amen to that? (Amen)
       
       6
        And that is the issue that the ministry and the people following the message, they cannot
       except and they’re running from today. And they will have to come face to face with the great
       issue and the great challenge of this hour on the Token Baptism of the holy spirit. Every man and
       every woman that’s listening to tapes today and following this message are going to have to face
       this message. I believe that this is thee message, The Message of The Hour!

       328 Truth and error! Oh, my! No matter how good that it’s… Truth and error cannot mix. It
       cannot mix. It’s either the THUS SAITH THE LORD or it’s wrong. No matter what holy father
       said it, Saint Bonifer, or—or the archbishop of Canterbury; I don’t know who said it. If it’s
       contrary to the Word, it’s perversion. It won’t mix. Say, “Why, this fellow done…” I don’t care
       what he done, how much holy he is, or anything like that. THIS IS THE ONLY DIRECT
       TRUTH THAT WE HAVE. No church, no creed, has no Truth, if it’s outside of This.
        I believe it is the message of the hour and “Ye must be Born Again!” Unless your born again,
       you’ll never come into the body! Because it’s only going to be a Word Born Body. A Word Born
       person that is gonna come into the body of Jesus Christ. Because that body is the body word!
       John 3:3-Reference quote:
       3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again,

       229 But if God said so, that makes It so. There ain’t no “surely” to It. YOU MUST BE BORN
       AGAIN. YOU GOT TO RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. EITHER THAT OR PERISH!
       Notice. 230 And here He—here He come in, Jesus and God became one. They united. 231 Like in
       Eden, where there Adam and Eve was in the beginning, the same spirit. Their names was called
       Adam. See? He was both Adam and Eve, together. And when was separated, to go the test, what
       happened? Eve fell, by the Word. That was the Word. Adam went out after her, to redeem her,
       but he couldn’t do it. He wasn’t worthy to redeem her. 232 Then along come the Second Adam,
       to redeem the Church, which was in shadow and type. 233 Now, as sure as Adam and Eve had
       to be the same spirit, Christ and the Church has to be the same Spirit, the same ministry. “The
       things that I do, shall you do also.” You see what I mean? They had to unite together. Flesh
       and blood, and God, had to come together and be one Spirit. And Jesus Christ and His
       Church is one Spirit. How can the church deny creation, how can the church deny the thing that
       Christ told them to do, how can we deny It and then say that we are of Christ? “If ye abide in
       Me, and My Words abide in you, ask what you will and it’ll be given to you. I am the Vine, ye
       are the branches, and the Life that’s in the vine goes into the branch to bear the fruit.” Fruitbearers! 234 “And every limb that don’t bring forth good fruit, is hewed off.” That’s the way
       
       7
       organizations did, break it up, get the Word mixed up, and start off like that. And one starts one
       this way, and one that way, and, first thing you know, a few little bunch of Rickys come in and
       they get their idea in it, and, the first thing you know, then it’s just become a big bunch of
       Babylon. He just prunes it off. 235 Never did an organization ever rise, but what it fell. And
       every one fell, never did come back again. I challenge that to anybody. Yes, sir. You know
       history. There never was one. God, as soon as they organize, He puts them on the shelf, and that
       ends it. He will take a man from somewhere else, bring it right out. Certainly. 236 Notice in this
       now, they have to become one. Jesus said, then, “The Life that’s in Him will be in His
       Church.” And here is exactly what He promised in the last days, that the Life that was in
       Christ, that was in…will be manifested in the days that the world is in a Sodom condition just
       like it is now. Can’t you see, brother, sister? 237 What good does it do to join church if you
       haven’t got Christ in your life, and Christ identifying Himself in your life? See, that’s it. “These
       signs shall follow them that believe.” He said that. How could you say it, if it’s not, how can
       you claim to be Christ’s?

       William Marrion Branham
       109 Paul was down here in the natural realm with his Ph.D. See? He didn’t know. He had an
       intellectual faith, but he didn’t have a Divine faith. There’s quite a difference in me having an
       intellectual faith than a Divine faith. There’s where you, my Baptist friends, failed to go on. You
       get the intellectual faith by that, but IT MUST BE A DIVINE REVELATION OF JESUS
       CHRIST TO YOU THAT TAKES SIN OUT OF THE HEART. Intellectual faith is not
       enough. That’s all right, but it only brings you to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a personal
       experience of the birth, the new birth, regeneration, making a new creature in Christ.
        All right! Notice there is no condemnation whatsoever, to the believer that’s come into the
       body. But as long as you are on the outside of the body the devil is gonna punch at you and
       pound at you. That’s why, that you must strive and struggle and work out your salvation with
       fear and trembling to come into that body. Because when you come into that body, then your just
       as holy and righteous as God is. You can no more perish than God can perish because you are
       part of God. No way in the world for the devil to get you.
       Philippians 2:12-Reference quote:
       12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much
       more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
       Romans 8:1-Reference quote:
       1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not

        Brother, there is where your eternal security’s at, is in the body of Christ. And that’s where
       every individual ought to be striving and struggling and earnestly contending to come into that
       body. Because all outside of that body is gonna stay on the earth. There’s only one thing that’s
       gonna go in the rapture and that is, those that have come into the body.
        And those that are sleeping in the dust of the earth are waiting till this great holy spirit comes
       and places the end-time believers into the body and then the resurrection will take place. And the
       reason the resurrection has not taken place, is because the believers that are alive on the earth
       today, have not come into perfection in the body. Remember the body is perfection. There is
       nothing beyond the body. How many is glad for that? (Amen)

       367 You get it? These people who died, in here, are depending and waiting on us. So, this
       Church has got to come to perfection, in order to bring the resurrection. And they’re under,
       souls under the altar, waiting for this Church to come to Its perfection, that when Christ does
       come. 368 And this Church, you see, is coming smaller, in the minority. [Brother Branham refers
       to his chalkboard drawing—Ed.] It’s a whole lot sharper than that, but just like to write that
       cross there, see. It’s come up to a needlepoint. Until, the Church, in the minority, has got to get
       into a place until it’s the same kind of a ministry that this left, because, when this Headstone
       comes back… 369 It’s got a little pocket-like here, where it’s going to sit right in there, on the
       regular pyramid. It just isn’t a cap that sits across the top. It’s a little flange, and it’s got to sit
       on there, ’cause it sheds the water. And when it comes, this Church has got to be honed. 370 All
       these, rest the stones in the pyramid, are laying so perfect till you can’t run a razor blade
       between them, weighing tons, laying in there. How they got them up, they don’t know. But
       they were built. 371 And up here, when the pyramid Cap does come, the pyramid Itself, the
       Body of Christ will have to be honed. Not only just some creed or doctrine, or something other
       we come through. It’ll have to be so perfectly like Christ, till, when He comes, He and that
       ministry will fit right smack together. See? Then will come the Rapture, the going Home.
        Oh, have you been baptized into the body? No! No! How many say no? (No) Thank God for
       honest hearts. Notice, that you can never get any place with God, by being dishonest with
       yourself and with the word. And that’s what happen to this ministry in this hour, is that they’re
       not honest with the word.
        And I remember the tears of Brother Branham said, “When I pass away, God let me hand this
       ole Bible over to somebody that’ll be honest with it.” And God will not use nobody today that’s
       not honest with the word of God.

        Notice here, until you come into that body the devil’s gonna condemn you. Notice that there
       will come an hour…There will come an hour when every person that has not come into the body
       
       10
       will be condemned by Jehovah God. There’ll come and hour when the blood will leave the
       mercy-seat. The blood has not left the mercy-seat, there’s still mercy. And as long as there’s
       mercy sinner friend you can come to Christ. But there’ll come an hour when the blood leaves the
       mercy-seat. When you can scream, and cry for mercy and God will laugh right in your face. You
       say, “Laugh at you?” Yes, sir! Laugh at you, because he is a terrible God.
        There’ll come an hour, where the sanctuary will have to be cleansed. They’ll come an hour

       uncle, your mother or your father, will be able to come and sit down with the believers that are
       all in the body, when the time comes when that last member comes into the body. Not when the
       last member sees the message. Not when the last member hears the tape recorder. No, when the
       last member comes into the body. Then the sanctuary will become full of judgement, and the
       blood has left the mercy-seat and you will be packed out dead if you don’t go out some other
       way. But there’ll come an hour when you just cannot sit there any longer.
        Notice that all outside of the body will be under the condemnation of God. All outside of the
       ark perished, everyone drowned. Even the birds, the animals, the bees, whatever it was drowned.
       And there’s only one power, there’s only one safety place, that the righteous can run into today
       and that’s the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. It’s the only place. All outside the body will die.

       Look. 210 Then, if you are Abraham’s Seed, you can’t dispute with God. Abraham’s Seed is a
       part of this Spirit. For, God gave Abraham a sign of circumcision, cutting off the flesh, for a
       witness He had received him. In this last days, has took the Holy Ghost and circumcised every
       believer, of cutting off all doubts and unbelief, to believe God’s Word is pure and holy, and It’s
       the Truth. Circumcision; cutting away all unbelief, everything, cutting loose every shore line.
       Saying, “God, I believe You; live or die, sink or drown. It’s Your Word. I believe It.” Then, see
       what I mean? 211 And God said, “I’ll swear by Myself, ’cause there’s none I can swear by.”
       He’s the greatest thing there was. He said, “I’ll swear by Myself, that I’ll save Abraham and his
       Seed.” That’s right. 212 Now who is the Seed of Abraham? Those who are filled with the Holy
       Ghost, are Seeds of Abraham. Look. Look. For Abraham come Isaac; through Isaac come
       Christ. How do we get into Christ then? We can only be in Christ…The Bible said, “You that
       are in Christ are dead, and are taking on Abraham’s Seed, and are heirs according to the
       promise.” Is that right? Whew! “Those that are dead in Christ, are Abraham’s Seed, and heirs
       according to the promise. 213 So, through that Blood cell! Through your natural blood cell, was
       broken away, and you are enshrouded with the Blood cell of Abraham’s Seed, which is Christ. In
       that Blood cell, can only contain…Not iniquity, and filth, and nastiness. INSIDE OF THAT
       BLOOD CELL, CAN ONLY ATTAIN THE LIFE OF GOD, WHICH IS THE HOLY GHOST.
       214 AND YOU CAN NO MORE BE DESTROYED THAN GOD HIMSELF CAN BE
       DESTROYED, FOR IT’S A PART OF GOD. “I’ll raise them up at the last day.” “Those who
       He has justified, He hath already glorified.” And in the Presence and the mind of Almighty
       God, EVERY MAN BORN AGAIN OF THE HOLY GHOST IS GLORIFIED IN HIS
       PRESENCE NOW, WAITING FOR THE TIME OF REDEMPTION. Whew! My, my! You see
       
       11
       it? God, through grace, has called you to Abraham’s Seed. And every one of Abraham’s Seed,
       Almighty God swore by Himself He would raise him up. God said He would take care of it. 215
       How you Abraham’s Seed? By being dead, your life hid, “By one Spirit we are all…” Not
       “lettered” in, not “sprinkled” in. “But by one water”? No. “But by one Spirit are we all
       baptized into this Blood cell, which is Christ Jesus. In the original, was only one Blood cell, and
       we’re baptized in There, with Him, and He was the Son of God. [Brother Branham claps his
       hands together two times—Ed.] And we are sons and daughters of God, joint heir with Him in
       the Kingdom, believing everything the Father says is the Truth. Hallelujah! Brother!
        Why will all outside of the body die? Because God has a law…God has a law that is his
       commandments his word. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, thou shalt not covet thy
       neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s, anything that he has. Thou shalt love the
       Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy might and with all thy soul. Thou shalt not steal,
       thou shalt not lie. Thou shalt not bare false witness. That’s Gods word. And Gods law is so great,
       and it’s got the greatest penalty and that is death. So therefore, God has a law and a law is no
       good without a penalty.

       63-0901M - Token
       William Marrion Branham
       259 And then when he heard Pastor Moses speak, that day, he said, “But you’ve got to get
       beneath that blood, for God said, ‘The blood is a token.’ It’s a token! No matter how much you
       believed, how much you are circumcised; that’s a covenant God gave to Abraham, and so forth,
       that’s the covenant. But you’ve got to get beneath the blood, that’s a token, for He said, ‘When I
       see the blood, I’ll pass.’ Israelite, or any!” 260 That’s denomination or not denomination,
       either one, you must come beneath the Blood. Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal,
       undenomination, whatever you are, it’s for an individual. You’ve got to come beneath the
       Blood. Now just don’t talk about It; receive It! Hear me! Hear me! In the Name of the Lord,
       hear me! See? Got to come beneath the Blood! 261 He was not responsible for any persons
       from beneath the blood. GOD MADE IT CLEAR THAT ALL FROM UNDER THAT BLOOD
       WOULD PERISH. 262 MAY I USE HIS WORDS? ALL OUTSIDE OF CHRIST WILL
       PERISH. How do you get in Christ? First Corinthians 12, “By one Spirit!” 263 Not, “by one
       handshake, by one membership, by one denomination.” That’s what they’re trying to make it.
       They may do that. 264 “But by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body.” “If an angel from
       Heaven teaches anything else,” Paul said, “let him be cursed.” THAT’S THE MESSAGE,
       COME INTO CHRIST! 265 Look, any persons outside of the token, God was not responsible.
       And God is not responsible for any person, big or small, popular or unpopular, rich or poor,
       bond or free, male or female; He is not responsible for anybody that’s from under the Token
       covenant. He’s not responsible. 266 You say, “But, O Lord, I’ve did this. I cast out devils. Lord,
       I did this. I—I preached the Gospel.” 267 “Depart from Me, you that work iniquity. I never even
       knew you.” HE ONLY RECOGNIZES THE TOKEN.

        What good is a red light or what good is a twenty-five-mile hour speed sign, if there’s no law
       to back it up and put you in Jail and fine you.
        So, God in order to be God he had to have a law. And the wages of breaking Gods law, and
       the wages of sin is death.
        Like people think today, because God is silent and don’t strike them dead immediately, they
       think they can smoke marijuana and live in fornication like they do…God have mercy!
        I used to live over in Meriden, Ct. and them long-haired devils over there demon possessed
       boys. Down there on the bank of the creek there, playing that wicky wacky guitar all night long
       and smoking dope. I didn’t get any sleep. Demon power was so great, I couldn’t even hardly
       close my eyes. I finally got out of that wicked place and moved over here in Rockfall Ct. a little
       country place and now them long haired beast devils are over there to. DON’T YOU TELL ME
       THAT LONG HAIR AIN’T A DEVIL! I don’t care what you call it, it’s devils. Get their long
       polls and tents out and go over with them girls and live-in filthy fornication all night. LET ME
       TELL YOU SOMETHING CHILDREN! THAT’S THE BEAST GENERATION that’s coming.
       That’s nothing but the beast. Them devils over there and I heard them devil’s squalling out about
       three o'clock this morning. I heard Mark and Timmy jump up out of the bed and run out, “What
       is it?” I said, “It’s devils crying out of men in the last days.” What is it? People think they can
       break God’s law and get by with it! You can’t do it! THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH! A total
       separation from God. We’re coming to that hour that we’re living in right now. Oh my, the
       wages of sin is death.
        God has a law and when you break that law brother your gonna be judged for it. People say,
       “The law is done away with.” Let me tell you something, the law is here as long as Gods here
       and the Bible here. No sir! Jesus Christ never done away with the old testament the law. Jesus
       Christ only magnified it and made it harder. He said, “Except your righteousness exceed the
       righteousness of the scribes and of the Pharisees, YOU SHALL IN NO-WISE enter into the
       kingdom of heaven.” That’s tougher an’t it? Amen) That’s tougher than, thou shalt not steal, thou
       shalt not kill, thou shalt not bare false witness, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife. When a
       man covets his neighbor’s wife, HE’S UNDER THE JUDGEMENTS OF GOD!
       Matthew 5:20-Reference quote:
       20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
       scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
        Why? Because the Bibles said, “Covertness which is the sin of idolatry” How many
       covertness people is sitting right in this message of this hour? Coveting after this kind of car,
       coveting after this, coveting after that. More of this, more bonds, more money, more this, it’s
       IDOLATRY!
        The soldiers said to John the Baptist said, “Well, you got the scribes and the Pharisees John,
       now what are we soldiers gonna do?” He said, “Do no violence to no man and BE SATISFIED
       with your wages.”
       Luke 3:14-Reference quote:
       14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto
       them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.

        Brother and sister as we was coming to church this morning, I said, “God we’d everyone
       would be better off, if my boys and I had to hook up an ole mule this morning and put them to a
       horse and wagon. All them ole rubber marks, all over the highway, I can’t sleep at night any
       more. Hear them ole open pipes roaring up and down the highways ninety miles an hour in
       second gear and hundred and ten in third gear. People can’t sleep, you call the law and you can’t
       get nobody.
        But let one of my children throw a ball in the neighbor’s yard and the police is down there in
       ten minutes. GOD, I HATE THIS WORLD! What is it? Teenagers demon possessed, that’s all
       you see. The devil is taking them right onto hell. But the devil don’t tell them the wages of sin is
       death. Eternal separation from God and everlasting life in a lake of fire. Don’t tell the people
       that! This age is just hell bound, that’s all there is to it. Bring Christ, that’s what I say!
        All outside of the body of Jesus Christ will perish. The WRATH OF GOD ABIDES UPON
       EVERYTHING that’s not in the body. So then, “If that’s true, well then Brother Bob, how are
       we gonna get into the body?” That’s what we’re doing here this morning.
        Notice here there’s not one speck of condemnation to the man or to the woman, or to the girl
       or to the boy that comes into the body. When you come into the body of Christ, it’s an absolute
       TO YOU! THAT YOU ARE PASSED FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE. AND YOU CAN NO
       MORE PERISH THAN GOD HIMSELF CAN PERISH! GOD SWARES BY HIMSELF THAT
       YOU’LL NOT DIE!
        Saint John 5:14 said, “He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me, hath
       everlasting life and shall never come into condemnation: but has passed from death unto life.”
       John 5:24-Reference quote:
       Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
       everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.”

       27 Well, that would be the same Man today. He’s here. He will let you do things, and so forth,
       like that, but when you go to sinning, and get with—and going like that, then however, the line
       will be drawed. Something will come down there and stop it, and say, “Looky here just a
       minute.” Is that right? Sure, He does. He chastens His children: chastens them. I believe He
       does. And the Bible said that “They are brought upon us to try to our faith.” Is that right?
       Now, if you’re sick tonight and something might’ve happened along the road, and you sinned, or
       something another, ask God to forgive you. Maybe you been a little dilatory. And you say, “Well,
       I never went out and got drunk.” You don’t have to get drunk to sin; just disbelieve. That’s sin,
       unbelief. I’d go out, I’d say, “It’s nighttime.” I can’t say, “Just this much is nighttime, or just
       that much is nighttime.” It’s all nighttime. 28 Now, we know drinking and carrying on is sin; but
       the whole thing is because of unbelief. ’Cause if you believe God, and Jesus Christ to be His Son,
       you are absolutely not going to do those things. You believe that? “He that’s born of God does
       not commit sin.” See? All right. You must believe. The whole thing lays in faith. Jesus said,
       “He that heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, has Everlasting Life, shall not
       come into condemnation, but’s already passed from death into Life.” Do you believe that’s the
       truth? There it lays. There isn’t nothing else that you can do, only believe. And if you believe,
       
       14
       then them little immoral things will just drop off, like that. As you believe, you become love. And
       love is God. And you begin to wind yourself into Christ. And these other things, you don’t have
       to quit doing them; they just quit themselves. There’s just no desire to do it. “The worshipper
       having purged, has no more conscience, or desire of sin.” Hebrews 9. See? “The worshipper
       once purged…” See what I mean? When the worshipper is purged, is when he is born again,
       when his old nature dies, and a new nature sets in. Then he becomes a part of God, a son of God.
       He gets new Life, and the Life is… And the Greek word there is “Zoe,” which means “the Life of
       God.” And you become an offspring of God. And God can’t hurt you without hurting Himself.
       See what I mean?

       52-0900 - God's Way That's Been Made For Us
       William Marrion Branham
       10 Now, this week I’ve tried to prove, by the Scripture, that the man that’s born again of the
       Kingdom of God has nothing to fear. You’re absolutely, safely secure in Jesus Christ. “All the
       Father has given Me,” He said, “will come to Me. No man can come ‘less the Father calls. The
       Father has got to lead him up to Me; and he that comes to Me, I will in no wise cast out. And all
       the…No man can pluck them out of My Father’s hand; no man is greater than He is. He that
       heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting Life; shall not come
       into condemnation, but has passed from Life…from death unto Life. He that eats My flesh
       and drinks My Blood hath,” not will have, “but hath,” present tense, “everlasting Life, and I’ll
       raise him up at the last day.” 11 “Wherefore grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you’re
       sealed until the Day of your Redemption.” There you are. “Sealed away until the Day of your
       Redemption.” Not just from one revival to another, but till the Day of your Redemption.
        Notice here, here’s the first stages of being able to pass from out from under the
       condemnation of God.
        Now I feel lead of the Lord to say what I’m saying! Don’t you take this message lightly this
       morning, I’m speaking in the name of the Lord.
        Notice here, “He that heareth my words and believeth on him who sent me hath everlasting
       life. And shall never come under condemnation but has passed from death unto life.” Showing
       you that after you hear the word of God, there is coming an hour when people are gonna pass
       through the condemnation of the Lord God!
        WE’RE LIVING IN THAT HOUR NOW, when sin has heaped up to the mountain top. And
       God is sick of these long-haired devils and all these demon possessions out here. Ripping and
       raring up all night long. Did you know the devils move at night? Everything evil moves at night.
       It’s real quiet at day light and the birds begin to sing. And them devils has worn them bodies out
       and they got to lay them down at night. The Bible says, in the last days that young men would
       have long hair and would be livin with women in fornication and no fear of God. That’s the sign
       that God is sick of everything. It’ll come under the condemnation of God. You bear me record! It
       ain’t far off. The wrath of God is going to belch from end of this country to the other.
        God help us as believers, that is hearing the word of God. We’ll not come under the
       condemnation of devil. Why? If you hear and understand the word of God and you believe the
       one that sent the man that’s bringing the word of God. THEN HE PROMISED YOU THAT
       
       15
       HE’D BRING YOU INTO HIS SIDE HIS SAFETY PLACE. AND THERE’S NO SAFETY
       OUTSIDE OF THE BODY OF THE LORD JESUS. Come into the body!

       54-1003M - The Word Became Flesh
       William Marrion Branham
       231 Look! God, through His prophet, Isaiah, a man who had his up’s-and-down’s like we do,
       had his mistakes like we do; but God got that man so yielded, by being a prophet, that his
       words…God’s thoughts! Hallelujah! God’s thoughts expressed through those mortal lips of
       Isaiah; a man with sin and things I have, with his up’s-and-down’s like I have, and like you
       have; but a yielded vessel to God, expressed the thought, God’s thought, through word. And no
       matter what they done, Isaiah’s words had to be fulfilled, for it was God’s thought expressed
       through Isaiah. 232 There you are. Hallelujah! O God! “Upon this rock I’ll build My Church,
       and the gates of hell shall not prevail against It.” Oh, my! When the world is no more,
       “Heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word shall never pass away.” Why? He was
       expressing, in Word, the thought of Almighty God. And when we, by faith, can accept that
       Word, it’s got to become material. Oh, how it thrills my heart, to think, “Thy Word, forever, in
       Heaven, Lord, is confirmed.” What God’s thoughts is, He expresses them in Words, and Here
       is the living Word of God. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit several times—Ed.] 233
       Jesus said, “He that heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting
       Life, and shall not come into condemnation; but has passed from death unto Life.”
       Hallelujah! 234 Not “he that goes to church.” Not “he that puts his name on the book.” Not “he
       that professes.” Not “he that shouts.” Not “he that heals the sick.” Not “he that opens the
       blinded eyes.” Not “he that speaketh with tongues.” Not “he that prophesies.” 235 “But he that
       heareth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting Life, and shall never
       come into condemnation, but has already passed from death unto Life.” Oh, brother, let that
       faith anchor one time in that heart, till them Words will be true before God. Then, heavens
       and earth will shake and go away, but that Eternal Word, that thought that’s in your heart,
       that’s expressed by God, can no more fail than Isaiah’s words could fail. 236 There has been
       thousands looking at them miracles was done, and yet could not believe, because Isaiah had
       expressed it and said, “They will not believe It.” 237 God’s Word is Eternal. “In the beginning
       was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” God, in the beginning,
       back there when He seen the world, He seen you and I here this morning. He seen my baby
       sitting back yonder. He seen every hungry person in India. He seen every preacher in the pulpit.
       He seen every hypocrite walking. He seen the whole thing. The infinite mind of God foresaw it.
       238 And He said, “Now, to redeem that fallen race, I’ll send forth My Son, Christ Jesus.” There
       was the Word. In the beginning, before it was a Word, it was a thought. Before, it was a
       thought; it was expressed in a word; and the Word become material and dwelt among us.
       Hallelujah! Ten million years, maybe, before the world was ever formed, God’s thought seen
       His body, tabernacled in flesh, to take the sting out of death. Whew! 239 How Eternal is the
       Word of God! Oh, times will change, years will come and go, aeons of time will pass away; but
       God’s Word will remain forever. There it is! 240 “O Lord, let me hide Your Word in my heart,
       that I sin not against You. Let me meditate It, day and night. Let me write Your commandments
       upon My bedpost. And let Them always be—be before Me. And, Lord, that I sin not in my heart
       against You.” But let me walk in It. “There is therefore now no condemnation,” Romans 8:1.
       
       16
       Hallelujah! “There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the
       flesh, but after the Spirit.” Amen. 241 God’s expressed thoughts, into the human heart, moves
       right on, as the immortal God leads His subjects from place to place. And the Bible said, “The
       footsteps of the righteous man is ordered of the Lord.” Oh, my! How new is the world? How
       long is Eternity! When we think of the Word of God expressed through the lips of a mortal
       being, yet so submissive to the Word of God!
        How are you gonna get into the body? By the capstone that he’ll send from heaven.
       Understand his word, when you understand his word by a revelation of God by the Holy Ghost
       you receive everlasting life. And then God brings YOU HIS PROVIDED WAY INTO THE
       BODY.
        You hear people say, “Glory to God, we’ll go up there and we’ll get down and have a tarry
       meeting, we’ll tarry! We’ll pray!”
        God said, “Just go down there and just believe it and wait there!” And I’ll send it. That’s my
       provided way. You believe my word; I’ll send you what it takes to put you into that safety place.
        I BELIEVE FOR THE FIRST-TIME IN ALMOST TWO THOUSAND YEARS, THAT
       GOD IS BRINGING A PEOPLE TOGETHER THAT ARE GONNA COME INTO GODS’
       SAFETY TOWER THIS HOUR. Knowing what a thing that’ll be brother, if you can come into
       the tower of safety, you’ll know that you’ll be saved and you’ll not burn.
        He’s not going to drown these things with water! But he’s gonna burn them with fire. And so,
       our only place of safety is in the tower, the body of the Lord Jesus, where the righteous run into
       it and are saved. And once that believer comes into that body, then the devil never able to put
       one bit of condemnation on them again.
        The very reason that you are tossed to and fro and pounded by the devil both night and day is
       because you have an understanding of God’s word. And you know that if you don’t come into
       the body, that the wrath of God abideth alone upon you. So therefore, it puts pressure on you.
       John 3:36-Reference quote:
       36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not
       see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
        GOD HAS A CHAMBER THAT TAKES THE PRESSURE OUT OF THIS THING! AND
       THAT’S CHRIST! Your gonna have more pressure all the time, till you come into that body!
        Oh friend, oh how my heart doth rejoice and magnify the Lord, when I can see the things
       taking place around me and know that God has left us a promise. How we ought to rejoice, what
       if we had no hope. What if we had no hope for our children? What if we had no hope for our
       loved ones?
        Notice the law, why does God condemned everything that is on the outside of the body. Why
       is because God’s law is so great and he’s so holy…In order to justify his great law he couldn’t
       send his son down and die. He had to become the son, he was both father, son and holy ghost. Go
       ahead and say it was his own father if you want to. You’ll never see nothing but Jesus only. He
       become the son! He was the father to become the son. Why? BECAUSE GODS LAW WAS SO
       GREAT AND SO HOLY AND SO RIGHTEOUS AND SO PURE AND IT WAS DEATH!
       AND HE COME AND TOOK THE DEATH PENALTY FOR YOU AND I. WHY DID HE?
       WHY CALVARY, WHY THE CROSS, WHY THE BLOODY CROSS? SO, THERE MIGHT
       
       17
       BE A PROVIDED WAY FOR YOU TO COME INTO HIM! WHERE THERE IS NO
       CONDEMNATION. HALLELUJAH! Where there’s liberty, where there’s freedom, where
       there’s joy and peace and happiness.
        Notice here, the believer…Oh this is so wonderful! The believer, he didn’t have no sin till he
       heard the word. He thought he was so spirit filled today and everything was just so right, he was
       just a little miracle worker and everything was just fine till the prophet brought the word of God.
       And then that He was living in peace and thought everything was right, and the very thing that he
       jumped and hollered and shouted for joy slayed him, killed him. Slayed him and killed him! We
       didn’t have no sin, till the word come. Huh! We didn’t have no sin till the word come!
        We thought everything was all right. Oh, we we’re justified sanctified and filled with the holy
       ghost and had a mind to go on. And then the prophet of God come and said, “You ain’t got it!”
       And then you begin to get scared. Because he took your tongues, your evidence away from you.
       He took your works away from you. “Oh, glory to God I quit smoking” Well, smoking will give
       you cancer, you shouldn’t smoke at all. “I quit running around on my wife” Well, you shouldn’t
       break your marriage vows, that’s the wrong thing to do. That an’t salvation. “Well, a quiver went
       down my spine” Well, that’s wonderful that ain’t it either. “Well, glory to God, I saw a vision”
       So did millions of others, but they never mounted to a hill of beans. That ain’t salvation. But
       when the word of God come the law of God’s word come today from the prophet of God…
       Brother we thought we was all right, we thought we was alive and the word of God slayed us!
        No wonder Jesus said…When the Greeks come and said, “We would see Jesus” He turned
       around and said, “Except a grain of wheat fall in the ground and die, it abideth alone.”
       John 12:24-Reference quote:
       24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
       alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

       this Laodicean Church, lukewarm… “Lo, I stand at the door and knock.” Laodicean, we can

       William Marrion Branham
       260 Pentecost has done the same. They speak in tongues, and so forth, “That’s all you have to
       do. That’s got it. Come on, join the church.” All right. Get your false baptism, and so forth,
       and go on, “And that’s all you have to do.” See? 261 But when Christ comes, He’s Coming for
       a virgin with…a Church without even one spot or one wrinkle of denomination or any other
       thing, dogmas mixed with it. It’s going to be Word, and That alone. 262 Now, oh, man, here we
       are! Blessed be the Lord! Now we come to the Body to be the Bride of Christ, now to be His
       “flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.” Now, we’ll hurry up now. “Flesh of His flesh, and
       bone of His bone.” Why didn’t… 263 Ask you a question. Why didn’t all your rains, back
       yonder, bring the bride to Christ? I want you to answer me that. If…His Coming is overdue. We
       believe it. (Like it was in the days of Noah, longsuffering, He’s getting His Bride ready.) Why
       didn’t these rains…Why didn’t you Pentecostals back yonder, a few years ago, when you
       started, forty, fifty years ago, why didn’t you bring Christ, the Bridegroom, to the bride? Going
       to let that soak, a minute. Why? BECAUSE YOU PREGNATED HER, YOURSELF, WITH
       YOUR DENOMINATION. THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DONE. HE WON’T MARRY A
       WHORE. He’ll marry a virgin. It’s flat, but that’s the Truth. You know It, in a flat way. You
       don’t have to wonder. I don’t stumble around about It. Tell you the Truth. WHY DIDN’T IT
       BRING HER? WHY DIDN’T IT BRING CHRIST, BRING CHRIST TO HER? BECAUSE
       SHE’S NOT FIT. HE FOUND HER IN ADULTERY. 264 Exactly the reason children don’t
       live forever when they’re born; Adam found his wife pregnated. 265 That’s the reason
       Jehovah had to take a Gentile Bride; found her pregnated. 266 That’s exactly the way Christ
       has to get Him a Bride now; He’s found the so-called group pregnated. HE’S GOING TO
       SOW HIS SEED. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET IT, BECAUSE THEY’RE
       PREDESTINATED TO BE A CHURCH AT THE END OF THE ROAD. 267 Like Adam and
       Jehovah’s, He found them pregnated with man-made doctrines of denominations. Like God’s
       Truth, in Genesis 1, “Every seed has brought forth after its kind.” So, when the Spirit fell on
       her, man had been there to her womb, and filled it with denominational seeds of his own
       thinking, so that’s why she got to be the way she is, and Christ could not come to her. Hum!
       That’s hard, isn’t it?

       104 Well, they say, “I don’t need anybody to teach me. Glory to God, I got the Holy Ghost.”
       Well, then, the Holy Ghost was wrong when It said It set some in the church, teachers? God put
       them in the church, as teachers. That settles it. Why’d He put teachers in there, if the Holy Ghost
       is going to do all the teaching? See? All right. See? 105 What people needs is their brains
       baptized, besides their water. That’s right. All right. Excuse that sharp expression, but I—I like
       to really let her soak in. We want a revival, and, brother, you got to stir the thing up. Before you
       
       19
       can do it, you got to get Satan kicked away. Don’t fuss with him, take your grounds and stand
       there. Had to battle him, around the world, and every other Christian that ever stood for God
       has to battle him. But if you know what you’re standing in, what you know is to be the Truth, it’s
       THUS SAITH THE LORD, you can stand there. 106 You say, “Well, glory to God, I got saved
       because I quit drinking. Glory to God, I had a shiver run down my back. I had a rushing,
       mighty wind to hit me in the face. Do you believe that, Brother Branham?” Sure. But I want to
       see where that rushing, mighty wind come from, first. See? That’s right. Truly. That’s shivers,
       all right, but I’m not saved because I had a shiver, and not because I had a rushing, mighty
       wind. “You don’t believe in that, brother?” Yes, I do. But wait a minute, let’s back up here just a
       little bit. The devil’s got some counterfeits along there. 107 I’M SAVED BECAUSE I MET
       GOD’S CONDITIONS. HE CALLED ME, AND I KNEW HE CALLED ME. I ACCEPTED
       HIM ON HIS WORD, THEREFORE I CAN TELL SATAN, “THUS SAITH THE LORD!”
       
        We saw the eternal word of God, and we died, so that we might be born again. God’s word
       God’s law come! And what did the message of Brother Branham do? It magnified our sin. We
       begin to see what a sinner we was in the sight of God. Where one day everything was alright.
       And now everything is just a trembling and we don’t know where saved, we don’t know whether
       we’re goin in the rapture. We don’t know which ends up, when you hear those tapes.
        You know the believer, it’s like the law, takes the believer today and puts him in jail, puts him
       in prison. And then they go have court, the cases are already set up, the prosecuting Attorney just
       condemns you every which way with the word. And then after he tries your case, you say, “I’m
       gone, I’m lost, I can’t make it, there an’t no hope for me! I quit smoking, I quit drinking and I
       thought that was alright. And now I hear this attorney and he’s just pouring it on me! I’m just
       gone and there’s no hope for me” And then the attorney takes off and turns around and puts on a
       great robe and puts on a white wig. And the same prosecuting attorney goes down and sits down
       behind the desk and say’s, “Case dismissed!” And then the believer so stupefied and just
       staggered by the prosecuting attorney becoming the judge and the case dismissed. Why, is
       because we was guilty alright, we was condemned. But what it was, he said, “somebody else
       took your place” Jesus Christ! Your free!
        So, we sought after the righteousness of Christ, by giving up smoking, giving up drinking,
       speaking in tongues. Saying, “Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the
       Lord, now you finally got it.”
        The sister from down in Jeffersonville brought to me a new form I never heard before, for the
       way they got the holy ghost. The way they got it when she was getting it, you know. And this
       brother had a way that just prayed them right through to it, where you could be righteous with
       God. And it was, “Holy rollie pollie” Just keep saying, “Holy rollie pollie” and you’ll get it! That
       beats saying “Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.” We found out, that it didn’t come that way!
        We who sought after the righteousness of Christ, by the works of the denominations found
       out that it was not righteousness at all. If it come by the works of that, then the promise is not
       sure to the seed. But the promise is sure to the seed, is because the righteousness of Christ is by
       Faith! “For by faith, are you saved through grace, not of works lest any man should boast.”
       Ephesians 2:8,9-Reference quote:
       8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
       9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
       
       20
        So, we have been put out of prison, the bondage has been broken away from us. Because we
       have accepted Gods provided way through faith. Through a revelation upon God’s word we
       become his righteousness. Ain’t that wonderful? (Amen)

       it’s got to have rapturing faith. We can’t even have faith for Divine healing, let alone
       rapturing faith. Got to have a faith that’ll change and quicken this body, and be taken away. I
       believe there’s a Church on its road tonight, a Power of the living God, that men will speak the
       Word here and there, and it’ll flash like lightning. And a Church is coming out; not a
       psychologist, not some of this put-on, make-belief; but a real, true, genuine, anointed, Holy

       221 One Angel come to Abraham and his group up on the mountain, and performed a miracle,
       by discerning the thoughts that was in his heart. Is that right? And Sarah on the inside. Where,
       the angels that went to Sodom had thousands down there. See, the shaking comes in the little
       group. You’ve seen it, Joseph. You’ve seen Chicago get its last call. That’s right. And God
       honored you, done just exactly what He said. Getting the Bride ready, that’s what it is. 222
       Now we’re going to end right here, by saying this. The end-time Message is to get the Bride
       ready and prepared for the Rapture. What can it do? According to Malachi 4, is bring them
       back to the Faith that was once delivered to the saints. Bring them back to the Faith of the
       fathers, the pentecostal part, in the restoration time. “I will restore, saith the Lord.” That’s
       real event, end-time evangelism.
        Now notice here…notice here that the law was spiritual, the Ten commandments are spiritual.
       All of Leviticus and all the law is very, very spiritual. But the thing about it, we’re carnal. We’re
       the fault, the law is not at fault. We’re the fault! The thing about it, we just couldn’t be righteous.
       Honey brother sister, there’s no way for you to be righteous.
        I was trying to get salvation to my sister who was steep in sin. She was wanting to be
       beautiful and she was wanted to be a movie star. Ended up a prostitute all most. You say, “I
       shouldn’t say that about your sister.” I’d say it if she was here this morning. Tell the good along
       with the bad. That’s why it would be better off, if your little girl was just as ugly as a mud fence.
       Provided that she thinks she’s so pretty that world can’t live without her. When she ain’t nothing,
       she ain’t worth but fifty cents. That ole spirit leaves that body, nobody wants her at all. And they
       got to take her down and put her in the grave, cause she gonna be stinking rotten filthy nasty and
       smelly, in just a little bit.
       
       21
        So, who you are and what are you? You an’t nothing, not a thing. And there’s nothing you
       can do to earn salvation, not one thing. For by grace are you saved through FAITH! Not of works
       lest any man should boast. IT IS THE GRACE OF GOD, that saves you! GOD’S BLOOD IS SO
       HOLY AND SO RIGHTEOUS, HE CAN MAKE THE VILEST SINNER WHOLE. Thank God
       for the blood of Jesus. You see your calling. You see what you was. And what are you, sitting
       here this morning? You are what you are because of the grace of the Lord Jesus! Because of his
       mercy! How can I be sitting here this morning…Lord how could I possibly be here with these
       people that’s waiting upon thy faithfulness? IS BECAUSE GOD HAS CALLED YOU! AND IF
       ANYBODY WILL BE SAVED, IT WILL BE BY THE GRACE OF GOD! So, what do we have
       to boast of?
        Well you say, “Look at them poor ole hippies” Well, if it wasn’t for the grace of God, what
       would you be today? You don’t know what you’d be if you didn’t have the grace of God. What
       can we say? “The grace of God” It’s God’s grace that gives us godly sorrow. There’s no way in
       the world for a man or woman to be saved, unless God gives them godly sorrow for their sins.
       Godly sorrow leads to repentiveness.
        So, what is it? There we was in Jail only to find out we didn’t have nothing laid against us.
        No wonder apostle Paul penned those great words, “He Jesus Christ was delivered for our
       offensives.” He was delivered unto Calvary for our offences. He who knew no sin became sin for
       you and I, that we might become the righteousness of Christ. And he was raised from the dead,
       for our justification. Hallelujah! Therefore, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus
       Christ.
       2 Corinthians 5:21-Reference quote:
       21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
       righteousness of God in him.
       Romans 4:25-Reference quote:
       “Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.”
       Romans 5:1-Reference quote:
       1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
        All right now here is the believers; hope here I’m trying to say. Here’s your hope till you
       come into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. You can have peace through this wrathful God,
       through the Lord Jesus Christ. And the only way that you can have access to Jesus Christ, is by a
       divine revelation upon his promise word for the hour. You then can have peace with God
       through our Lord Jesus Christ.

       He that is the elected Life, the predestinated Life, that’s in Me,” and He is the Word, “from the
       beginning; when he comes forth, he’ll bear My fruits.” Saint John 14:12. But others will live by
       the same thing, calling themselves Christians and believers. “Not all that saith, ‘Lord, Lord,’
       will enter in.” Now, this is to take place and be manifested in the last days, “when the mysteries
       
       22
       of God should be finished,” as we’ll get to a little later. 52 These trees, the true vine and false
       vine! You’ve heard me preach on that since, from years ago, how they’ve growed up together.
       Brought them in individuals and showed that, from Cain and Abel, the two vines that met at an
       altar; both of them religious, both of them anointed, both of them desiring life, and worshipping
       the same God. And one was rejected and the other received. And the only way that the one that
       was received could have done anything different from his brother, it was revealed to him. For
       the Bible said, “By faith…” Hebrews, 11th chapter, “By faith Abel offered unto God a more
       excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God testified that he was righteous.” Jesus, said,
       the spiritual revelation of Who He was! “Who does man say I the Son of man am?” He said,
       Peter said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” “Blessed art thou, Simon—
       Simon, son of Jonas; flesh and blood never revealed this to you. My Father which is in
       Heaven has revealed it. Upon this rock I’ll build My Church,” (what?) THE TRUE
       REVELATION OF THE WORD. There is the true Vine again. “Abel, by faith!” You said, “IT
       WASN’T A REVELATION.” 53 WHAT IS FAITH? FAITH IS SOMETHING THAT’S
       REVEALED TO YOU; THAT IS NOT YET, BUT YOU BELIEVE IT WILL BE. FAITH IS A
       REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD. SO, BY REVELATION! 54 And the churches today
       don’t even believe in spiritual revelation. They believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system.
       “By revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God
       testified he was righteous.” Amen. I hope you see that. See where we’re living? See the hour?
       
        Notice why the judge dismissed the case against you! It was not because you quit drinking,
       you quit smoking, you quit running around on your wife, you quit gambling, you quit living in
       fornication and adultery drinking and sousing around all night like these beasts out here tonightlast night. It wasn’t because you quit all them things, that he dismissed your case. He dismissed
       the case, because he couldn’t find any fault IN THE LORD JESUS. BROTHER THERE’S ALL
       KINDS OF FAULTS IN YOU, AND DON’T YOU THINK THERE AN’T! Our case was
       dismissed because the wrathful judge couldn’t find any FAULT IN THE LORD JESUS.
        Why, is because that Lamb for the sacrifice for the atonement had to be kept up for fourteen
       days for God to look him over! And he couldn’t find any spot in him or any blemish in him at all.
       Jesus Christ was without spot and without blemish. IT’S NOT WHAT I AM, WHAT I GAVE
       UP, IT WAS WHAT HE WAS FOR ME, HALLELUJAH! HE DIED THAT I MIGHT LIVE.

       and, ‘When I see the blood, I’ll pass over you, for it’s a token that you’ve accepted the death of
       the lamb that I have provided for you.’” The blood was the token. 147 Now the Spirit is the
       Token. “You shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.” And when the Blood
       was shed, the Token was sent down on the Day of Pentecost, like a rushing, mighty wind. 148

       That was the theme of every apostle. That was, “Have you received the Holy Ghost since you

       bible like you ought to. Look how you got mad at your brother. Look, you talked about your
       sister last week, you’ll never be able to make it. You can’t make it, you may as well leave the
       assembly, there’s no hope for you.” That’s ole Lucifer talking to you! That’s the ole devil talking
       to you.
        Let me give you Gods test this morning. CAN YOU HEAR HIS VOICE? CAN YOU
       BELIEVE HIS WORD? CAN YOU BELIEVE ON THE ONE THAT GOD SENT? THEN
       YOU HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE, AND SHALL NEVER COME INTO CONDEMNATION.
       THAT’S THE DEVIL TALKING TO THIS CONGREGATION. CAST THE DEVIL OUT! HE
       THAT HEARETH MY WORDS AND BELIEVETH ON HIM WHO SENT ME HATH
       EVERLASTING LIFE! AND SHALL NEVER COME TO THE CONDEMNATION. AND
       THE WORKS THAT I DO SHALL HE DO ALSO AND GREATER WORKS THEN THESE
       SHALL YOU DO. Because I go to my father.
       John 6:29-Reference quote:
       Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he
       hath sent.
       John 5:24-Reference quote:
       Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
       everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
       John 14:12-Reference quote:
       Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and
       greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

       64-0321E - The Voice Of The Sign
       William Marrion Branham
       203 He said, “If you come back at all, God hasn’t spoke to me.” Uh-huh? See? There was a
       prophet, THERE WAS A SIGN; THERE WAS HIS VOICE. And to fail to obey It brought
       judgment. 204 The Holy Ghost is our prophet today. Fail to hear His Voice? He’s identified in
       the Scripture, that He would say these things. Jesus Christ, the form of the Holy Ghost! 205
       God dealt with this one man. This, God never deals with groups; it’s with one man. Elijah
       wasn’t a group. John wasn’t a group. They wasn’t a group or a denomination, neither one of
       them. But both of them condemned such. That’s right. John said, “Don’t you think to say we
       have Abraham to our father. God is able of these stones to rise children to Abraham.” 206 And
       the end-time sign will have an end-time Voice. And the end-time sign will be according to what
       is predicted in the Bible. And the end-time Voice, that follows the end-time sign, will be exactly
       identified in the Scripture, will be the Scripture that’s been promised. 207 Now we’ve read in
       Luke 17 what the end-time sign would be, would be like it was at Sodom, a promise. And we have
       the Sodom in the natural, why can’t we believe the sign in spiritual here? If you can see the
       Scriptures, also, Luke 17 is the sign, and Malachi 4 is the Voice. The sign was like God
       manifested in flesh, knowing the secrets of the heart; and the Voice of Malachi 4 was turning
       the people away from their creeds, back to the Faith of the fathers. That’s the sign. 208 You
       know what? I’m closing now. Signs are usually accepted, sure; BUT, THE VOICE, OH, NO.
       THE VOICE THAT FOLLOWS THE SIGN, THEY DON’T WANT NOTHING TO DO
       WITH THAT. Yes. 209 Jesus’ sign, as Messiah, to heal the sick, they accepted that. But one day
       He said, “I and the Father are One.” 210 Oh, my, that Voice wasn’t accepted. They said, “You
       make Yourself God, equal with God.” He said, “I’m the Son of God.” 211 “Oh, my, how could
       God have a Son?” See? “Far be it from God having a Son!” 212 But, you see, they believed
       the—the sign, the sick could be healed, and, oh, that was wonderful, that was just dandy. But
       when it come to the Voice, they didn’t want to believe the Voice. What’d they do? They put
       Him out.
        The devil’s done took flight already! Casting out devils left and right, by the word of God.
       HE’S our perfection! HE’S our justification! HE’S our holiness! And HE’S OUR
       RESURRECTION! Yes Lord, I know my brother will live again! In the last days, when the
       resurrection comes. I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE, HE THAT BELIEVETH
       IN ME THOU HE WERE DEAD YET SHALL HE LIVE!! I’M HIM!
       John 11:25-26-Reference quote:
       25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he
       were dead, yet shall he live:
       26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
        Do you believe God’s WORD? (Amen) Understand Gods word. You shall never, never come
       into condemnation.
        Let me tell you something brother and sister, as long as you got that death in you, the body is
       death it’s gotta die. It’s gotta die, there’s death in that body there’s no good in it. There’s sins in
       
       26
       it and sin will stay in it. Because it was born wrong and IT’LL NEVER BE RIGHT UNTIL
       GOD MAKES IT RIGHT BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT DWELLETH IN YOU AND
       QUICKENS INTO IMMORTALITY! It’ll give you trouble until you lay it down. So, don’t get
       your eyes on your flesh! Don’t get your eyes on your faults! Don’t get your eyes on your
       mistakes! But get your eyes upon the perfect Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of unbelief.
       And he’s become a justifier for the believer today.
        Who is that devil, who is that demon that’s gonna keep you in jail, when God said, he
       dismissed the case? You know what? The devil can remember every little thing that you stole. I
       forgot that egg, that I stole out of the hen nest. I forgot that little orange, that I stole out of the ole
       country store. I forgot that piece of bubble gum that I never had money to buy and I slipped it in
       my pocket and then it condemned me that night. But by and by as I got older, I forgot the egg, I
       forgot the little orange, I forgot the bubble gum. BUT WHEN I MET HIM GLORY TO GOD, I
       REMEMBER EVERY EGG, EVERY BUBBLE GUM AND EVERY ORANGE I EVER
       STOLE AND WITH TEARS IN MY EYES, I WENT BACK MAKING RESTITUTION FOR
       IT.
        I’m afraid of some peoples experience today, when they hear the word of God and they hear
       the unsearchable riches of Christ preached and they’re never sorry for their sins. And they never
       go make restitution, I wonder if you ever met him or not! I believe in restitution for your wrong.
       Some of those things you can’t go make right.
        But I went and made everything right, that I could make right. I beat a man out of three
       hundred dollars when I was a young boy and it’s haunted me to this day. I promised God when I
       met him there and stood in his presence and heard his voice. I said, “God if you’ll help me, I’m
       poor I don’t know how I’d ever get that much money. But if you’ll help me, I’ll go back to that
       man and I’ll ask him in sorrow and in tears to forgive me for that wickedness” That’s why I say
       boy, don’t never cheat nobody. Don’t never lie, even if you’re not a Christian or even if you’re
       not a Christian don’t do it. It’ll damn your soul. When you do except Christ, you won’t have to
       go back and make those things right.
        But oh, when I see holiness and I see how great his and then it’s the least I could do is go and
       humble myself and say, “Forgive me! I’m a Christian now and I shouldn’t of done that. Won’t
       you please forgive me.” Brother and sister, it’ll turn to your testimony. People say, “I never
       heard of such a thing, I’d forgot all about it! Here, here I don’t want that money. You take it and
       put it in the ministry.” I said, “No sir! Please take it! Please take it, I owe it!” So, then when you
       go there, the glory of God and the goodness of God will make you feel so good that you went
       and made things right. I wonder about things today?
        God’s penalty for breaking his law is death! There’s only one way out for you. That’s to
       accept Gods provided way to live. You don’t have to do nothing, it’s a law. Just accept Christ.
        By a revelation, God…What is it? Here it is! You say, “Yes, I believe God, I fear God”
       That’s not wisdom but it’s the beginning of wisdom. You say, “I fear God” That’s good! “I
       respect God!” That’s good! “I fear God!” That’s the beginning of wisdom. It’s not wisdom but
       it’s the beginning of it. And then you just say, “Lord I want to serve you” All right! Read the
       written word, hear the word of God being preached. And by and by if you accept him in your
       mental faith, the word of God pouring into your mental faith, the holy Ghost will turn it into
       divine revelation and then your justified. I hope you didn’t let that pass by now?

       55-0123E - Earnestly Contend For The Faith
       William Marrion Branham
       109 Paul was down here in the natural realm with his Ph.D. See? He didn’t know. He had an
       intellectual faith, but he didn’t have a Divine faith. There’s quite a difference in me having an
       intellectual faith than a Divine faith. There’s where you, my Baptist friends, failed to go on. You
       get the intellectual faith by that, but it must be a Divine revelation of Jesus Christ to you that
       takes sin out of the heart. Intellectual faith is not enough. That’s all right, but it only brings you
       to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a personal experience of the birth, the new birth,
       regeneration, making a new creature in Christ.

       58-1221E - The Unity Of One God In The One Church
       William Marrion Branham
       53 You see, Satan uses a man’s head. He chose that in the garden of Eden, to take a man’s
       head, his thinking. And he has brought that down even to the church. See, the devil takes a
       man’s head, so he can use his eye. And if you’ll notice, if the man isn’t genuinely born again,
       spiritual, he’ll take what he can see with his eyes, the pride of life. And he’ll go, many man, to
       say he’s going to—to achieve something, he wants to join church. He wants to be religious. And
       he’ll look around till he can find the biggest church he can find, because man wants to do
       something big. He wants to make a big name for himself. That’s what carnal, foolish-thinking
       man think, “Oh, if I can have my organization! If I can only add so-many thousands to my
       denomination, it’ll be the largest then in the land, of its kind!” What good does that do? But he
       thinks he’s achieving something because he’s adding more. 54 I believe it was some years ago,
       in 1944, that the Baptists had a slogan out, “A million more in ’44.” And what did they have
       when they got a million more? Just like joining a lodge, if they wasn’t genuine, born-again
       disciples of Christ. They were just Baptist by name. 55 Look at the other denominations, the
       Lutheran, the Presbyterian, the Pentecostals, all the other denominations, they’re the same.
       They’re trying to achieve something. They want to do something great, see, because it’s his eye
       he’s looking at. He thinks with his eye. And many times he don’t understand that that’s the thing
       that he oughtn’t to do. But, the devil takes the man’s eye, he shows him something pretty. He
       opens his eyes to look at it. And he’s got that into the church, into the intellectual thinking of
       man. 56 Sometime ago, this great evangelist, Billy Graham, stood here in Louisville, and held up
       his Bible. He said, “This is God’s standard.” And he’s right. He’s exactly right. Mordecai Ham,
       the evangelist, (my old Kentucky home), and I, were sitting at the same table; which, Billy was
       converted under Mordecai Ham. And we were sitting there. And he said, “What happens?” He
       said, “Paul went into a city and got one convert, he returned a year later and he had thirty by
       that one.” Said, “I go into a city and have twenty thousand converts, return in a year and can’t
       find twenty. Something is wrong.” And he said, “You know what it is? It’s you lazy preachers
       that set in the buildings, your offices, with your feet on the desk, and don’t go visit the people.”
       57 I thought, “Billy, that’s a very good intellectual,” please don’t quote me, “but that isn’t it.”
       Who was the pastors that went to that one that Paul got converted? 58 It wasn’t that. It’s here.
       Those so-called meetings today, and they are great meetings, but it only works on the
       intellectual part of man. A man gets under the spell of a revival, and he says, “Yes, I accept
       
       28
       Christ,” and he does it intellectually because he’s in a great crowd. He does it because there’s
       great ministers before him, but it’s only an intellectual conception. That man can never go on.
       HE’S GOT TO COME FROM HIS MIND, TO HIS HEART, AND BE BORN AGAIN, OR
       HE’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO STAND THE TEST. 59 Intellectual conception is all right, but
       when…Remember, when the eye looks upon it, the devil uses your eye. In the garden of Eden, it
       proved that the devil chose the head of man, to work in, but God chooses his heart. The devil
       shows him, with his eyes, something that he can see, and he says, “Seeing is believing.” 60
       BUT WHEN GOD COMES TO A MAN, HE COMES TO HIS HEART. AND HE LETS HIM
       BELIEVE THINGS BY HIS HEART, THROUGH FAITH, THAT HIS EYES DOES NOT
       SEE. FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, THAT, “THE FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE OF
       THINGS HOPED FOR, THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS NOT SEEN.” 61 God working here;
       Satan working here. So what good does these big schools and seminaries do anyhow? It
       sometimes, not always, but too many times, it pulls from here, up to here; when it ought to be
       taken from here, down to here in the man’s heart. 62 You know, the Scripture says, “As a man
       thinketh in his heart, so is he.”
       
        Notice here, there’s no condemnation in Christ. But as long as you are on the outside of that
       body…Now you could be the Bride, you could sit right there you’re the Bride. If you got faith
       and you believe, your justified and your sanctified. But your set aside out here, waiting to come
       into the body for service. But as long as you are on the outside, the devils gonna be pounding at
       you and condemning you.
        Why do you think that ole Lucifer…Oh I got his number! You know what it means when you
       get the number? We got his number today, by the opening of the word of God. Why is he up
       there in heaven, condemning the bride before God? Why is he up there saying, “Did you see
       what Brother Norman did? Did you see what brother Aitken did there? Did you see what Sister
       Aitken said? Did you see what Brother Lambert said? See, what he did what he did he shouldn’t
       do? Did you see Bill Britten there? Did you see that, did you see that? He said that he’s a
       believer, look at him there?” Well, you say, “You didn’t call my name Brother Bob.” I call every
       one of your names. Awe don’t you get thinking that! If you get thinking that, you’re in worse
       shape then all of us.
        There’s ole Lucifer coming right before God saying, this and that, that, that, that! And after he
       gets through telling all. He said, “That’s right! But look here, do you find any fault in that perfect
       Lamb there without spot without blemish? Do you see that bloody Lamb? That bloody Lamb is
       standing for Herold Britten. That bloody Lamb is standing for Brother Aitken. That bloody Lamb
       is standing for every one of my children. Now if you can find any fault in him, I’ll listen to you.”
       And then he turns around and walks away.
        BUT GLORY TO GOD, THERE’LL COME A DAY WHEN GOD WILL SAVE HIS
       CHURCH SO GREAT, THAT THEY’LL BE SAVED TO SIN NO MORE! What good is the
       devil gonna do going before God, when every member has come into his body and they become
       Christ! They are the mercy-seat then. He ain’t even gonna accuse you anymore, he ain’t got no
       chance, there’s no condemnation.

       51-0508 - Faith Is The Substance
       William Marrion Branham
       32 After the days of that, came along Jesus. He was God’s Ensign. And He was lifted up. He
       ascended on high and give gifts back to men. And men received the baptism of the Holy Spirit to
       be made deity himself. Now, that didn’t set very good. But that’s according to the Word. A man
       or a woman that’s borned of the Spirit of God is a part of God. Amen. You are sons of God and
       daughters of God. Didn’t Jesus say, “Isn’t it written in your Scriptures, your laws, that you’re
       gods.” Not to forgive sins now, but you’re sons and daughters of God, limited to your faith. 33
       And the very God, back there in the beginning that rolled the world, the moon, the stars, and
       made them from things which do not appear, or made them out of things that do appear. Out of
       things… And where did He get the material to make it? He spoke it into existence by His Word.
       He said, “Let there be.” And it was so: Deity. And that—a portion of that deity dwells in the
       heart of every borned again Christian. Hallelujah. Then what did He say, “Ask what you will,
       and it’ll be given to you.” There you are. Deity, it fell on the day of Pentecost. It’s still falling.
       All right. 34 And men are regenerated, made a new person, sealed into the Kingdom of God by
       the Holy Spirit. The life of Christ pressed into them. All their drinking and immoral habits,
       and everything go out. The love of God is like a Notary Public: takes a seal and presses it until
       the inscription of that seal is pressed in the paper over the signature. Oh, my. And when Christ
       signs your name on the Book of Life, and the Holy Spirit presses It in there until the Life of
       Christ is formed in you (Hallelujah.) becomes deity. Men and women are sons and daughters
       of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know we’ll be like Him. For we shall see
       Him as He is, have a body like His own glorious body. And we’re waiting our perfect
       redemption. Amen. You believe it? 35 Our bodies are groaning, and we have an inheritance.
       And we’re children now, heirs of the Kingdom (Oh, my.), kings and priests unto God offering
       spiritual sacrifices.
        Of course, if you do wrong, you just get down and say…You won’t pray to him up there.
       You’ll just get down and pray to him and say, “Lord I didn’t mean to do that” He ain’t up there,
       he’s down here now. His Mercy-Seats here, “Lord!” I ain’t communing with him way off up
       there now, I’m communing with him down here now.
        No condemnation to those that come into Christ. All right now, who walk after the spirit, see.
       Now oh, don’t they quote this scripture out here in the denominations, “Brother if any man be in
       Christ, he’s a new creation he’s walking after the spirit.” See! That’s right, IF any man, IF!
       That’s a big word, IF! You are led by the Holy Spirit, IF you are in Christ Jesus. Now, this is
       gonna get a little sticky but just hold with me just a minute. IF any man be in Christ, there’s no
       condemnation, IF he’s in there. And IF he’s in there, he is a new creation, not an old one patched
       up. But he is a complete brand-new unit a total complete new unit, new creation. Now we are not
       a new creation yet the Bride. We are not the masterpiece revealed. But we are becoming a new
       creation. We are coming through God’s provided way, and God’s process to bring us into this
       new creation, see.
        Notice, a new creation when it comes into Christ by that one Token, Love, Baptism, Holy
       Spirit, Seal of God, that individual boy girl man or woman automatically then becomes a total
       new creation!
       
       30
        Now notice here. Once when he was on the outside of the body he didn’t have the great
       leadership of the holy spirit. He was not a miracle worker; these signs did not follow him. The
       works that Jesus did he could not do them. Why could he not do them? Because he was not in the
       body! The great works that Jesus did can only be done, in the Body! Visions, miracles, signs,
       wonders, all them great things. Speaking in tongues, interpretations of tongues, speaking the
       word, the creative power of God. That’s all in the BODY!
        Now children please, please listen to your pastor right here. Will ya? If you ever listen, please
       listen to what I’m saying just now. Your gonna need it down the road.
        Now IF, IF any man is in Christ Jesus. Now IF that’s a big word, IF, IF you are these signs
       shall follow them that believe. IF you are, the word will be made flesh! IF you are, you’ll be a
       living manifestation of Jesus Christ, you are Jesus Christ on earth! IF you are in Christ Jesus!
       See! IF, you are. And If the Token Baptism Seal of God has not come, then you are not in Christ
       Jesus. You’re only believing on Christ Jesus by a revelation. But brother, there is a vast
       difference in believing on Christ Jesus and believing in him!
        Peter believed on him, but he denied the Lord before the cock crowed. Now, the Law is not
       carnal the law is spiritual. He word is spiritual. But your carnal sold under sin. Your soul is held
       captive by that evil nature you got. Yes, sir! That’s what’s giving you all your trouble. It’s got
       death in it. Peter said, I’LL, I’LL, I’LL do this! Watch out!! Me! I, I’LL do it! I’ll cut his head
       off! I’ll, just let me at him! Before the cock crows… “I’ll say…I’ll say before the Cock crows
       Peter you’ll deny me three times.” “I’ll never do it!” Jesus knew that ole flesh was weak in Peter.
       He knew that Peter didn’t have power for service. He knew that Peter wasn’t in him yet. He
       knew that Peter believed on him though.
       Matthew 26:34-Reference quote:
       33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I
       never be offended.
       34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt
       deny me thrice.
        And he said, “I’ll say that your faith will not fail you, because I prayed for you.
       Luke 22:31-32-Reference quote:
       31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift
       you as wheat:
       32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen
       thy brethren.
        We may not in Connecticut may not be believing in him, WE MAY NOT BE HIS BODY
       YET. BUT ONE THING FOR SURE, WE KNOW HOW FAR WE HAVE COME! WE KNOW
       THAT WE GOT THE KEY TO UNLOCK THE DOOR FOR IT. We know that much. We know
       how much Holy Ghost we have got.
        You have just as much of the Holy Ghost in you this morning, as you have understanding in
       what I’m talking about! Why? Because the word is the Holy Ghost! The word is the spirit of
       God! And that’s how much of the spirit you got.
       
       31
        But there’ll come a sound from heaven…What is it? What we got is, the Holy Ghost in seed
       form. But the life is in that seed. And the greater the seed is growing the more the life that’s in it.

       identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 117 The Blood, Covenant Blood, is not
       recognized without the Token. The Word assures us of the promise. The Token is the sign the
       purchase has been made for us. 118 Full obedience to the full Word of God entitles us to the
       Token. No other way is there, that you could ever be entitled to the Token, until you fully obey
       the Word. Not what somebody has put into It, and added to It; but what God said about It! 119
       When He said, “You must be born again.” That don’t mean jump up-and-down at the altar; that
       don’t mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor; that don’t mean all this foolishness
       that we’ve seen done; it don’t mean putting your name on a church book. It means death to your
       first being, and Life to the second being. It means that the Blood has been applied, and you’re
       identified by the Life of Jesus Christ. And if He be the Vine, and we be the branches, the Life
       that’s in the branch is in also from the Vine. It’ll bear the fruit. 120 IF THAT FIRST
       BRANCH COME FORTH, THAT BRANCH OUT OF THAT VINE, THAT WROTE A
       BOOK OF ACTS BEHIND IT; IF THAT BRANCH EVER PUTS FORTH, A VINE PUTS
       FORTH ANOTHER BRANCH, THEY’LL WRITE ANOTHER BOOK OF ACTS BEHIND
       IT, ’CAUSE IT’S THE SAME LIFE. If a one of your grapevines out here brings forth blue
       grapes, if it puts forth another branch, it’ll bring forth blue grapes. 121 And I tell you, today, we
       got so many grafted vines into It, with denominations and creeds and things, and yet any citrus
       fruit grafted in can live, live in that Vine. But it’s bearing the wrong fruit. 122 What we need,
       today, is another baptism of the Holy Spirit, and have the real Power of God that identifies the
       works that Jesus Christ promised for this day, not so much as that day. This day, the promise
       that He made here. That was what He promised there, He would pour out His Spirit. Now He
       has promised it again in the last days, and what He would do.
        We may not be believing in Christ Jesus… You know that’s why I try to be honest with you?
       I know your crippled, I know you’re sick. But you don’t see me calling prayer lines. Why? Is I
       know where I stand. And you can’t bluff the devil. But God does things on the outside here, by
       believing on him. We get an answer to prayer ever now and then. But when we do it thrills us to
       death, we have to tell everybody about it. If fact it thrills you so, because it’s so uncommon for
       you to get an answer to prayer.
        I’m not teaching that God don’t answer your prayer! People take me wrong! They make fun
       of me and ridicule me. God will hold accountable for that. I’m standing here on the word of God
       and you make fun of it, it’s you that’s under the wrath of God, I ain’t. You make fun of God;
       you’re not making fun at me! People that go out here and make fun of me and laugh and talk
       about me, they’re not just talking about me, their talking about Jesus! You just watch their lives
       and see how they wind up and where they wind up at, see. Don’t make fun of God. Every one of
       
       32
       them are gonna have to face this before it’s over. Everyone is gonna have to face this issue. Only
       your honest and your sincere, and you’ve forsook all because you believe it’s the truth. So,
       blessed are you when man speaks evil of you and persecutes you and says slanderous things
       about what you believe.
       Matthew 5:11-Reference quote:
       0 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of
       heaven.
       11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil
       against you falsely, for my sake.
       12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the
       prophets which were before you.
       13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it
       is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
       14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
        We’re not believing in Christ Jesus, if we did brother you couldn’t get near this building this
       morning. The apostles the hundred and twenty believed on the Lord Jesus Christ but they
       believed on him until they come in him. And when they come in him they started believing in
       him. Why? Because they were demonstrating the faith of Jesus Christ.
        “Silver and gold, have I none” Oh buddy, I passed you here for many years. I passed you here
       ole cripple man, for many years lame from your mother womb. But I just received something the
       other day, up there in the upper room. I was believing on him but now I’m believing in him. I
       perceive, I perceive that God’s gonna heal you. Silver and gold, have I none, the council of
       churches took it all away! But in the name of Jesus, RISE UP AND WALK! THAT’S THE
       CHURCH BAPTIZED IN HER MIGHTY POWER, BELIEVING IN CHRIST JESUS.
        Now how many want to be honest? (Amen) You’ve got to be honest before you ever get in
       him. That’s right! Boy, this message just keeps coming, but I can’t get off it.
        Now if any man be in Christ, he’s a new creation. What was them hundred and twenty, that
       had excepted Gods provided way believing on the Messiah, what happen to them? He gave them
       a promise, that they’d never come into condemnation of Titus, coming up to the walls of
       Jerusalem. “Go down there and wait! For the promise of my father, I will send upon you.
       Luke 24:49-Reference quote:
       49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,
       until ye be endued with power from on high.
        My father loves you and I love you and we are coming to take up our abode with you and
       when you do, the works that I did, you’ll do also and greater works then these shall you do.
       Why? Is because, you are in me and I in you, and I’m in you and I’m doing the works and it’s
       not you.
       John14:12-Reference quote:
       11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works'
       sake.
       
       33
       12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and
       greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
       13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the
       Son.
        IF, IF any man be in Christ Jesus, he’s a new creation. If not, he’s still being worked on by
       the carpenter.
        All right now, you look in the word of God and see yourself this morning. See yourself, your
       right there. You say, “Is my name there?” No, not your name, but your right there.
        Now notice here, there is therefore now…There is therefore now, present tense no
       condemnation to them that have come into Christ Jesus by one holy spirit Baptism. There’s only
       one faith one Revelation and one Lord and one Baptism to get into Christ with. But when you
       come into there, there’s no condemnation any more.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 2 - The Patmos Vision
       William Marrion Branham
       Revelation 1:17-18, “And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand
       upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the First and the Last: I am He That liveth, and was
       dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” No
       human being could stand the full effect of that vision. His strength utterly gone, John fell at His
       feet as though dead. But the hand of the Lord in love touched him, and the voice of blessing said,
       “Fear not. Don’t be afraid. I am the First and Last. I am He That liveth, and was dead; and,
       behold, I am alive for evermore.” What is there to fear? The judgment that fell upon Him at the
       cross, at the grave, and when He descended, was for us. He absorbed the full brunt of the
       wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation TO THEM WHICH ARE IN
       CHRIST JESUS. See for a surety our “Attorney” is our “Judge.” He is both “Attorney” and
       “Judge.” As Judge the “case is settled” — it is finished. There is now therefore no
       condemnation. Why should the church fear? What promise has He ever failed to manifest
       before us? Why should it fear punishment or death? It has all been overcome. Here is the mighty
       conqueror. Here is the One Who conquered both worlds of the seen and unseen. Not like
       Alexander, who conquered the world at the age of thirty-three and knew no other way to turn for
       further conquest, so he died a victim of sin and riotous living. Not like Napoleon, who conquered
       all Europe but finally was defeated at Waterloo and banished to Elba, only to find himself
       conquered. But nothing could conquer Christ. He that descended has now ascended above all,
       and unto Him has been given a Name that is above every name. Yes, He conquered death,
       hell, and the grave, and has the keys thereof. What He looses is loosed, and what He binds is
       bound. There is no changing of it. There was no conqueror before Him and there is none
       beside Him. He alone is the Saviour, Redeemer. He is the ONLY God: and “Lord Jesus
       Christ” is His Name. “Don’t fear, John. Don’t fear, little flock. All that I am, you are heir to.
       All my power is yours. My omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst. I have not come to
       bring fear and failure, but love and courage and ability. All power is given unto Me and it is
       yours to use. You speak the Word and I will perform it. That is My covenant and it can never
       fail.”
       
       34
        You have the sworn affidavit of God himself, that you can no more die then he can die. Can
       God die? Can God perish? Can God come to the judgement? Do you think Christ could be
       judged again? Do you think Christ could come to the white throne judgment, that he’ll lose out
       and we’ll lose out? No sir! He was wounded for our transgression; he was bruised for our
       iniquity and the chastisement of his peace is upon us.
       Isaiah 53:5-Reference quote: 5But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement
       of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
        All right then, if you come to Christ you’ll never come into the judgement.
        Now, just a few minutes here. So therefore, brethren and sisters this morning, there’s no
       condemnation to them that have come to Christ Jesus. But let me say this, you better work out
       your salvation with fear and trembling right quickly to get ready to come into Christ Jesus. And
       by that you’re working out your salvation, that is your works to prove your faith. If you say your
       predestinated, let me see your works. Are you willing to leave houses lands and jobs and
       neighbors and friends and loved ones, to get this? If not, you’re not worthy of it and you’ll never
       get it.
        And people ask carnal questions. “Brother Branham, can a person go in the rapture, that don’t
       pay their tithes? That’s real spiritual an’t it? That person ain’t in the picture. I said, “Oh God how
       long, how long!” Brother Branham said, “Long, long, long…. suffering!” Waiting till somebody
       got spiritual.

       61-0723E - God Being Misunderstood
       William Marrion Branham
       146.? Please give Scripture to this question. 111 All right, if you will…That is right, that the
       Bible said in Malachi, the 4th chapter, “Will a man rob God? And Brother Branham, don’t you
       feel that everyone who claims to be a Christian should pay tithes, pay their tithes into the
       storehouse of the Lord you say, ‘Where have’ you ‘robbed Thee?’ In tithe and offerings. Bring
       all of your tithe and offerings into My storehouse, and prove Me,” saith the Lord, “if I will not
       open up the windows of Heaven, and pour out a blessing that there’ll not be room enough to
       receive.” 112 That’s a challenge to any individual! And if I only had the time, and would not get
       to this little Scripture that I wish to get to in about the next ten minutes, I would like to give you a
       personal testimony of how that I was even hungry, and my mother and them hungry, and my
       daddy sick, but I took my tithes out first and give it to God, and you ought to see what happened.
       I have never seen in my life, that any man or a woman, that if you only make one dollar a week,
       will bring the ten cents of that money and put it into your storehouse, or a church where you
       come, if God don’t bless that call me a hypocrite. Yes, sir. That’s a challenge to anybody. And
       every Christian…That goes to this other question. Every Christian should pay tithes! That’s
       right. It should be done.
        Now ask some questions just on these seals. “Brother Branham, should a woman just trim the
       edges of her hair?” I groaned, oh God! Oh, Lord when you gonna do it. “Brother Branham
       
       35
       should a woman wear a red dress?” “Brother Branham, should we go to any church that don’t
       believe this message?” He said, “No, just go right on.” If you ain’t got no more spirit then that,
       just go right on. If you an’t come no further then that, then just go right on. If you ain’t got no
       more than that, just go right on. But Long suffering, long suffering.
        How many think God for long suffering? (Amen) God is suffering long with us. How many
       want to hurry and get ready? (Amen) Well I say this, I believe that you people in Connecticut are
       the closest people to what happen on the day of Pentecost then any church people that’s ever
       raised up in two thousand years of history.
        Now notice here, though you may not be in Christ Jesus…Listen here! “Therefore, there is no
       condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.”
        Now I’m gonna say some little sticky things, right here right now. But, it’ll help you see. Now
       you follow your flesh more than you follow the Holy Spirit. Right present tense this morning.
       And I say that because, not just to plow your corn close and dig at you. I wouldn’t do that
       because I love you, see. But to let you know where you stand. Because you’ve got to understand
       the holy ghost, you’ve got to understand these things in order to not go out and pick up a
       pumpkin when you want to pick up a watermelon.
        Now notice if you was in Christ Jesus you’d be a new creation, you’d be doing the very works
       that Jesus did. Because you would have that power of his life to perform it.
        Now you cannot walk in the spirit…I mean to say, let me clarify that. You cannot have a real
       spirit filled, spirit walk with a spiritual leadership of the Holy spirit in service for the Lord, until
       you come into Christ.
        Now the Lord Jesus laid this upon my heart to preach this. And I have been in teaching and
       training by the Lord, and I have been instructed by the Lord Jesus to catch these things and
       notice them for fourteen years. And that I’ve always noticed about people, that they have in them
       a great desire to be worshipped themselves. Let me say it, that way. And that is a natural thing.
       That’s its natural for you to want to be well spoken of and well thought of.
        And that’s why it’s so hard for the teenagers today, it’s in their flesh to want be well thought
       of. That’s why they pattern to the mode of dress and styles and things of the world. I think we’re
       just gonna have to pray and be patient and trust God to bring everybody through this day. That’s
       in the ole evil nature.
        And I’ve noticed a desire in religious people, following this message and out in the religious
       world, that they have a great desire to be worshipped themselves. And therefore, they try to help
       God out. They try to help God out and help him move by his spirit, when he’s not moving by his
       spirit. How many understand what I’m saying? (Amen)
        I suppose that there has been tens of thousands of ministers raise up in 1955, 54, 53 and in the
       fifties…Tens of thousands of them raised up with testimonies that would raise the hair upon your
       head. And if you believe their testimonies, you would not know where you were standing in the
       word of God. But you couldn’t say nothing against it. But it left you in question and a wondering
       in your mind, after men got up and said, they was fasting for thirteen days. And after they had
       fasted for thirteen days, a ball of fire come through the ceiling and an angel appeared and said,
       “Now you’ll go forth with great power to heal the sick and you’ll be givin a sign, and it’ll
       operate, if you get the people to believe you.” I’ve heard hundreds of them myself. I don’t know
       if it’s hundreds, I’ve heard so many I don’t know, I’ve heard them for fourteen years, but have
       stopped lately because I was not out in the world any more. But forever I’ve met good men with
       nice ministries preach the word of God. And always, always they had met a great Lord, seen
       angels, had power.
       
       36
        And here I was crying night and day for God to anoint what he give me. And I couldn’t
       understand it.
        And boy, they was after money, like a hound dog after a rabbit. And I wouldn’t never take
       anybody’s money. And they’d get it. I’d drive an ole car with oil dripping out and sleep on the
       side of the road. My wife and I eating crackers and baloney, once in a while be able to get a
       MacDonald’s hamburger. And I’d cry and cry to the Lord. I’d say, “God I don’t understand. I tell
       the truth and nobody would listen to me.” Nobody listen! I’d no more then get started and
       everybody would speak evil of me, think evil of me. And I’d do no wrong! “Lord I try to walk
       perfect before you. And you know my heart. God why is that? Why is that?” You know when I
       found out, why it was? Is because I told the truth and they lied.
        And people will believe a lie before they’ll believe the truth. And that’s why you should not
       receive a story about a brother, because you’ll believe it. So somebody says, “No stop right there,
       let’s get down right here and pray for that brother right now. I don’t want to hear that because it
       may be wrong and I’ll be believing a lie. And if you believe a lie that somebody told on a
       brother, your just as guilty as the one that told it. And you give your ear…the briefs ear is not a
       filthy garbage can.” I told some ministers that to. I said, “I don’t want to hear no more of that
       junk and that filth. If you can’t call me and talk about something else don’t talk to me.” I’ll have
       my phone taken out, if I can’t hear something good.” Why? Because it would get me to believe
       it. I’m just a human being, and the devil pound me and get me to tell it. Then what if I tell
       somebody? It’s best to stop hearing such filth as that.
        And when you see people sin and do wrong… I don’t care if they claim to believe, stay away
       from them till they get right. Don’t say hello or good-bye, say nothing else just leave them alone
       and go right on.
        Be like the servant of the prophet, “Don’t speak to nobody, go straight there and do your job.”
       If you’re after the promise, the devil after you don’t think he ain’t! So, you watch who you
       fellowship with and who your around. Talk about the loveliness of the Lord Jesus. About his
       promise and about his word.
        Now notice here, in closing. So many around the country today and in the past and today try
       to give the impression to the people that they are in Christ Jesus, because that they’re so spiritual.
       If you talk to them you’ll notice they are so spiritual. You know, “The Lord told me this” I had
       some people that I went out pastored say, “We just came back from the store… This is a good
       example. “We come back from the store and they seen a price on some meat that they got and I
       heard them ask Shirley, “Did the Lord Jesus appear to Brother Bob and tell him to go down there
       and find that special?” Said, “The Lord told me the other day and I went down and found it for
       thirty-nine cents” Or whatever it was. Now I can look over that. But see that shows me, that your
       trying to impress me how spiritual you are. And really you impress me how unspiritual you are.
       And then I was forever…The congregation that I usually preach to, I’d try to being out these
       things like I am right now here, and they said, “What’s the used to hear brother Lambert he ain’t
       got nothing! Why I see visions” I guess my ears heard more visions then I could remember.
       “Now, let me tell you about a vision I had. And then there was this vision I had the other night.
       Did I ever tell you that vision I had a few days ago? Let me tell you about this dream”
        I seen poor Sister Branham, and I sit there and my heart ached and I was just praying and my
       wife was praying. Someone looked over and said, “I had a dream the other night ad you was
       doing this. And Sister Branham I want to tell you about that dream. And then my husband was
       upon the mountain and he saw this vision and then…And then this other sister” And that’s
       everywhere you go, see. And what is it? And them minister come in and say, “Well, why don’t
       
       37
       you believe? “I was up there and I and Brother Bob was up there and a cloud come down and I
       heard a voice speak out of it. And the Lord told me, I was gonna go forth and I was gonna bruise
       that serpent head and It started to rain. And boy the rain started to come down and I just stood up
       and spoke the word.” I said, “Now hold it there brother, watch out, watch out! See! Watch out!
       The very hour that we’re living in condemns what you’re saying.”
        Now I said, it’s gonna get a little sticky and it’s getting a little sticky. Ain’t it? But see, I got
       all the word to stand on and you ain’t got nothing to stand on! You ain’t got nothing! I got all the
       word and you ain’t got nothing.

       And what did he do? There has become, by it, a great falling away from the Truth. They got off
       on…The people don’t know what to do. Creeds, denominations, all kinds of isms, sensations,

       It. They don’t follow the charter, therefore they lose the course. And after all these years, when
       we got nine hundred and something different organizations of Christianity, and each one
       condemning the other, and saying, “This is right, and they’re wrong; and this is right, and that’s

       is what the Church needs for this end-time way. God promised to give them a sign for this last
       day.
       
        Did you ever hear me…Did I ever come to you in visions and dreams? (No, Never) Did you
       ever hear me come here, and preached to you visions and dreams? (No, never) I waited years
       before I ever told you one of those things that the Lord told me years ago when he appeared to
       me. And then you believed me, didn’t you? (Yes) Would you believe me if I continued if I come
       and say, I had a vision the other day and this and that and their…
       
       38
        Let me say this! There is where Satan has had a field day for years! With sincere people, see.
       See they try to impersonate somebody see. I wanna believe you, I wanna believe it, but all the
       time it’s giving me a ferocious battle trying to put it in the word of God. If I could understand it
       by the word, see. How many understand what I’m saying? (Amen) See brother Bill, I followed
       so many preachers I couldn’t count and God forsook me over it. I’m suffering right to day,
       because I believed everybody that come along. “I saw an angel” I’d say, “That’s wonderful! And
       I’d cry!” I heard a voice Brother Bob. I’d say, “Oh, that’s wonderful brother” And I’d get with
       that brother and here we’d go. And God would just pour it on me, lick after lick after lick and I
       suffered over it. And come to find out, he didn’t live no life. He never had no hunger for the
       word of God, after people’s money.
        I’d say, “God I don’t understand these things. I’d pray and cry till my eyes was swollen
       together and you won’t speak to me. These guys don’t live no life and you just speak to them all
       day long and they have visions all day long. I don’t see no visions, God it ain’t fair! Lord it ain’t
       fair.” Do you think it’s fair? (No)
        Now hold it right here! God knows I want a good solid, solid, solid, SOLID WORD BORN
       PEOPLE, that’s able to get something real. AND IF YOU LISTEN TO ME I’LL PROMISE
       YOU SOMETHING REAL!
        And I took note of this for years, watched it. Now notice, that all them people that was superduper spiritual, super-duper anointing, heard the word of the Lord day and night, saw visions all
       the time. I never seen them ever amount to a hill of beans and they ended up in disaster. Did you
       hear what I said? (Amen) I heard so many vision’s that people said.
        But brother, let me tell you something, do we realize that we are on the outside of the body of
       Christ? How many gonna say amen to that? (Amen) Notice, now I’m not saying that God doesn’t
       show visions on the outside of the body. Yes, I believe they’re genuine visions that are taking
       place by the sovereign grace of God. But notice here, even Brother Branham said, “That for a
       man to see visions his conscious and subconscious has to be right together.” And I noticed
       people saying they’re seeing visions, with their eyes closed. That’s not a vision! Remember
       before you can see a vision, it takes the supernatural power, the super… Not a blessing. But it’s a
       super, super, supernatural power of God to put you into another dimension that trance. And then
       God speaks out in first person.

       I said, “You see, that’s normal. But God so sets it to some of us that our first conscious and
       subconscious is right together. We don’t go to sleep. God just uses it to see things that was, and
       which is, and shall come. That’s prophetic.”
        Now notice, now notice here, God does not give that to everybody. How many knows that?
       (Amen) But I find this out, usually…now let’s say, people like that go on and on. And that kind
       of people will never be able to receive the straightness of God’s word. Why? Because when you
       take the word and show them that they are on the outside of the body, where those things do not
       operate.
        Now hold it here, let me quote the prophet of God! How many like me to quote him? (Amen)
       
       39
       The prophet of God said, “On the outside of the body people have sensations. They think they’re
       visions, they think they’re the voices of God but really, they are the sensations of their flesh.
       Trying to make God do something!” He said, “In Christ Jesus, we’re sitting together in heavenly
       places, he said we have signs and wonders and miracles and visions and the word of the Lord
       coming with Thus Saith the Lord. And that person goes and it happens just like that.” How many
       say amen to that? (Amen)

       20 And the antichrist spirit is a religious spirit; don’t forget that, dear people. And how blessed
       are your eyes that do see, and hear, and understand; for you cannot understand, unless God
       reveals it to you. For the whole church is built upon a spiritual revelation of Jesus Christ being
       the Son of God. Every time you hit it, you hit mixed multitudes, especially when supernatural’s
       done. Moses went out of Egypt with supernatural; a mixed multitude went. 21 Luther, many of
       you Lutheran people, why, history claims it wasn’t a mystery, how that Martin Luther protested
       the Catholic church and got by with it, but how he could hold his head above all the fanaticism
       that followed the revival. And that’s what it is today. And you non-Pentecostals, that what it’s…
       Let me say this as a Baptist: what I know of, the Pentecostals has a lot of nonsense. They have
       a lot of flesh and a lot of carrying on, but brother, there is a genuine Holy Spirit among them.
       That is right. So you Pentecostals, that can hold your head in the—into Calvary, and into the
       Word, and not on sensations, but according to the Word, and still walk before God, blessed are
       you. You’ve got the cream of the crop—Spirit and Word.

       What we need is an old fashion Holy Ghost revival to clean up the church. That is right. I’m
       not saying that jokingly; this is not a joking place, because we’re dealing with eternal
       destination to men’s souls that I’ll answer for at the day of judgment. But that’s true. No wonder
       the church has to go after all kinds of little isms, and fantastics, little sensations and things.
       Why take that substitute? Why don’t you clean up and stand still? Pentecostal skies are full of
       the real Holy Ghost that’ll make you what you should be. Why do you take anything like that,
       little isms? Because you’re trying to live in sin and possess the Holy Ghost at the same time.
       She’s took Her flight and left you. That’s what’s the matter with the church. That’s exactly right.
       So much, we’ll get on that a little later on.
       
        Notice that all these visions and miracles and signs and wonders and the perfect leadership of
       the Holy Ghost is on the inside of the body! And what the devil tries to do to sincere people…
        I went through that! I got mixed up in that when I got mixed up with the preachers and the
       power of God left me and everything. I suffered and I tried to listen to great men even in this
       message. I’d respect them and I’d be afraid to ask them point blank, but I’d hint to them that they
       may have enough word of God to help me. To help me and show me why, that this ministry
       
       40
       doesn’t operate that the Lord give me. And they would tell me some things and I’d try to do
       them. And if I would of gone on, I would of got in bad trouble. But then I seen better than that
       and I stopped that real quick.
        Notice here, even to the tabernacle they tried to see visions. Everybody seeing visions all the
       time. The only difference was none of them lived the life that Brother Branham lived. None of
       them was in the place where he was at. His visions mounted to something, and all theirs did, was
       the glory they got from telling it to other people. Notice the speakers and tongues and the
       prophesiers at the tabernacle. No secrets of the heart, did it ever make manifest. And the prophet
       of God knew it was on the outside of the body. That’s why that he put the judgement to it, and
       the question to it. And said, bring it into the room and write it down and none of them went. And
       what did they do? They went over to another brother’s church and was still speaking in tongues
       and prophesying and it’s all false and all of the flesh and nothing to it. What’s gonna happen?
       Just mark my words they’ll everyone miss the genuine thing that crosses the country and they’ll
       be throwed right into the tribulation. Because they wouldn’t except and be honest with God’s
       word. And they come to brother Braham and said, “You put the pressure on us” He said, I’m
       under pressure every time I go to the pulpit, not one time has it ever failed. It’ll tell you your
       name where you come from and what to do and everything sin that’s in your life. It cannot just
       quote scriptures. All right what about visions? What good does a vision! “I saw a vision and I
       heard something knock three times.” Well, what good is it? What good is telling a vision? “You
       heard something knock three times.” Do you see what I’m saying children?
        Every vision that Brother Branham ever had, you know that God revealed and put it right
       back in the word of God and it was a great blessing. It’s for the edification of the Body, for
       something real and genuine.
        Now notice here, just for an example, you see the disaster of the people that was in this group
       over false visions. Right today their trying to figure how they can get back here. They know now
       they made a mistake. But it’s about three years too late, see. Why? I knew, when that man said
       he, “knew how the third pull operated” I knew right there, was a wrong spirit speaking to him.
       When he said, “Seven angels appeared to him little birds with helmets on them.” I knew right
       then that he had a spirit on him thinking he was a prophet. And when I brought it to his face, he
       just smiled. Let me tell you something brother, a prophet is born, not made! They’re not made by
       some silly women behind them. They’re not made by your flesh in this hour. Anybody that
       would want a prophet’s ministry, ought to have his head examined. No, they still go right on,
       “The word of the Lord come to me! I got the word of the Lord. I saw a vision!” See! What is it?
       And a spiritual man’s sitting there knows, that he’s on the outside of the body. He knows right
       then that it’s an evil spirit. What did it do? Look at the fruit of that vision that he had. Now the
       people is trying to get a couple of ministers in the message to come and examine his doctrine.
       Trying to get rid of him, they see they made a mistake. When they’re as just and more to blame
       then that boy is to blame. Silly women! Now it’s damned that boy’s soul, and if God don’t have
       mercy on them they’ll go right to hell with him.
        YOU DON’T PLAY WITH GOD! BREAK ONE WORD OF GODS PLAN TODAY
       BROTHER, IS DEATH! YOU CAN’T PLAY WITH GOD!
        If you don’t fear God or don’t respect God…You got to watch when you say, “The Lord told
       me, I saw this” Watch out! OH, GOD BURN THAT DOWN IN YOU THIS MORNING WITH
       AN IRON PEN! These great signs and wonders and miracles and these great visions, take place
       over in the body, NOT ON THE OUTSIDE!
       
       41
        GO UP THERE AND TARRY, UNTIL YOU BE ENDUED WITH POWER TO SEE A
       REAL VISION.
        You can’t see a vision a real genuine vision without the power of God. Did you know people
       are on the outside of the body with no office? Don’t you realize that office is a special built thing
       down in that man. And if it wasn’t for that office he couldn’t hold himself up there right with the
       word. And then you try to dabble in the supernatural without even an office, without even being
       in the body, with all kinds of sin and flesh and your flesh controlling you. DON’T YOU
       REALIZE YOU ARE THE VERY TOOL FOR THE DEVIL? I know that’s hard, brother and
       sister. Am I telling you the truth? (Amen)
        And a man he says, “I’m Saul and he’s Abel” Because I know, he doesn’t have what he says
       he has. I said, “You’re no more called to preach then the man on the moon! You just don’t have
       it, so you’d better realize it, for sooner or later.” Why? Because I love him. Now he hates you
       now!
        See a person that tries to make people, impress people that you got all these great super-duper
       things, that you’re so spiritual, you’re just walking in the spirit all day long. And the holy spirit
       just tells you everything. See, people we done come too far children to try to accept something of
       imitation.
        I know some of you sitting right here and you know it and Brother Bob got on you hard. And
       you would of lost your mind, if I hadn’t come to you as a pastor and helped you. You all most
       lost your mind, over trying dabble in supernatural things that wasn’t of God. It was just the
       mercy and the grace of God that helped our poor little brother here in this group. You’ll know it
       and he knows, he knows I only say this to help you. And I love you. Now because he just walked
       on right with that word and grow'ed in grace and become a real humble sincere servant of Christ,
       God will use him.
        But you’ve got to wise up, don’t try to be so super-duper duper spiritual. You’ll make a better
       impression, if you just come out and tell the people, “I’m just so full of all kinds of faults. I wish
       I was led by the spirit, I’m just in bad shape” Now that’s spiritual there. So, see the way up is the
       way down and the way down is the way up. DO YOU SEE WHAT I’m TRYING TO SAY?
       (Amen) In other-words, don’t come up here on the front seat.
        I remember women sitting there boy, just writing down everything I was saying. Just smile,
       amen and writing everything down. And they was the most unspiritual women in my
       congregation. But you’d think they was God’s gift to the earth and the church couldn’t continue
       without them, they was just so spiritual. You see what I mean?
        What is spirituality? Why you know what? It fooled me! The very persons I thought was
       spiritual in my congregation, turned out to be the most unspiritual they everyone left me. Now
       who was spiritual? You don’t know who that seed of God is? Don’t you let that outward
       appearance try to fool you.

       55-1009 - The Way To Have Fellowship
       William Marrion Branham
       18 I’d rather have a church… Listen, just a moment. I would rather have a church that knows
       nothing about any spiritual gift, and just be so in love with each other and with Christ, I’d
       rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church. Now, that might sound hard
       in a Pentecostal group, but I would rather have it. Where there is gifts, they’ll fail. Where there
       
       42
       is gifts, they’ll bring confusion. Where there is gifts, they can be questioned. But where there is
       love, it is perfect. That’s right. And if you had perfect love you’d have perfect gifts. That’s right.
       So work first with love. That brings fellowship, and fellowship brings gifts.
        Now where’s all this stuff, out across the country right now, they’re out in their evangelistic
       ministry, trying to manifest gifts?
        I know a man that could preach like a house on fire, Glory to God, he preached this message
       inside out, upside down and around and around. Prophesying speaking in tongues see visions and
       everything. And went out and lived in adultery, with another woman. And still trying to go on
       preaching, in this message.
        Remember how many times your pastor told you! Follow a true man of God and listen to him
       and you’ll get something real, that’ll shake the nations with. Go ahead and accept something
       false, you’ll never mount to a hill of beans and you’ll end up on a heap of something. And people
       that confess and profess to be in the body of the Jesus Christ, and have all these things. Bare me
       record, that their sins will find them out.
        Now I’ve got to teeter-totter that and balance that back up and make it right. I’m not saying,
       that you cannot see a vision. I am not saying, that the holy spirit will not lead you. In fact I’ll say
       this! You people sitting here this morning have more leadership of the holy spirit then anybody
       that I know in the earth today and including the ministry. You have more of the holy ghost in you
       that any people I know of because you have more revelation. But for you to try to see visions and
       be so spirit led, that everything that you do, you think is the holy spirit the devil will bring that
       around and destroy you with that. You may get by and try to make out like your being spirit led
       and so great and then God will let you make the most horrible, horrible’est mistakes that you
       ever made in your life and then you’ll come down so low. And then it will be hard for you to
       come back up again. How many knows I’m telling you the truth? (Amen)
        So, what I’m trying to say is…Let’s just say this. Now usually a…let’s say a prophet…I don’t
       know why, but everybody wants to be a prophet. But to me, I think if they look and they seen the
       agony the responsibility, and no words to explain the hardship of the pressure and the other
       things that go with it. I really believe if they would weigh it out, they would be more thankful
       just being a little toe maybe, see then go through all that. Now usually there are so many today,
       that want to be a prophet. And if the devil can get you to believe you are one, and try to show
       you something, he’ll destroy you and take you and destroy you. Because he don’t care nothing
       about you, the devil don’t… He’ll just gouge your eyes right out and he’s got no mercy, see.
       He’s just a bloodless, godless evil thing, see. He’ll go to any means to destroy you.
        See, the Lord Jesus loves you, see. Listen, God is yearning and desiring to give you
       supernatural things. But he can’t give them to you, until he’s got you wired up right. How many
       rather get wired up right? (Amen)
        So, now see! Brother Branham said, “A man that’s real spiritual, when your around him
       you’ll think he ain’t spiritual. Because he don’t want you to think he’s spiritual.
        Not one time did I ever see Brother Branham, when he walked up to me say, “Praise the Lord,
       Hallelujah Brother Bob how you doin!” Every time I seen him, he was just as natural as can be.
       He’d say, “How are you Bob, looks like to me you gained some weight boy!”
        And I know some ministers that’ll call you on the phone and say, “Hey Hallelujah, Glory to
       God!” Because I don’t say that, they think my spirits bad. I see some people say, “Brother you
       down, you’re not smiling? Are you troubled, you troubled?” Then some people will say, “I think
       
       43
       he’s got something against me, he wouldn’t look at me and wouldn’t shake my hand.” How
       many have heard those things? (Amen) Or, “I don’t believe that person don’t like me because
       she don’t look at me right.”
        Oh, how I got fooled on that! I’d been preaching away, and I seen a woman looking at me and
       I’d look the other way. I said, “God she’s resisting everything I’m saying.” And I wouldn’t even
       look back that way. And I’d try to go out and maybe get…Not here! And I’d get out and get
       away real quick. And then God made that women come right around and say, “Brother, brother”
       I said, “Yes mam” I think, oh what’s she gonna say to me. She said, “Brother, you don’t know
       how that message blessed me!” I said, “Why, thank you sister!” Ain’t that a wonderful woman!
       I’d just feel so sheepishly and go home.
        Now let me show you there. Now let me show you the mistake I could of made. I could of
       got thinking and told her, “Sister you’ve got an evil spirit on you. You’re resisting everything
       that I’m saying” And I would of ruined my ministry right there. Now that’s what happens to a
       many good ministers. They get to a imagine a way a person is looking at them and think it’s an
       evil spirit coming from over there. And what’s it do? It hurts the congregation.
        Now let me tell you something about a real true servant of God. He’d look back there, and the
       supernatural would see that spirit. No guess about it, he sees it. And he’ll go right on laboring
       under that thing and won’t say nothing about it, a real seasoned minister will go right on. He’ll
       wait, and when the holy spirit supernaturally will call that thing, he’ll call it. And it’ll be perfect
       every time. And when he does brother…But here’s what usually happens, God doesn’t call the
       spirits. Let this be a lesson to you. God usually doesn’t call a spirit, but that spirit will call God
       and challenge God first, then he’ll judge it. Do you understand what I said? (Amen)
        Notice it was not Brother Branham that challenged the maniac. But it was the maniac that
       challenged the spirit of God. And the spirit of God said, “Because that you’ve challenged the
       spirit of God, you’ll worship at my servant’s feet.”

       3 And then Brother Osborn’s been here. Many of you know Brother Osborn, just love that boy.
       He was in my meeting the night over in, I believe at—at Portland, Oregon, when that maniac run
       to the platform, about nearly three-hundred-pound man, just out of an insane institution. He just
       hated preachers. He’d hit a man the day before. They was after him, the law was. He broke his
       collar bone, his jaw, and knocked him out on the street. And he dodged the law, and then he
       come in. There’s five thousand, five hundred there that night. And I just walked to the platform,
       and I was just standing there speaking on believe. And all at once somebody come running up
       through the platform, running up to the platform; there’s was about three hundred ministers
       setting in the back and they all knew the man. And he had a gray suit on, a huge man. And he
       come running up, just stomping like that, real fast. And I could detect there was something
       wrong. But I never… You know the first thing is the Word of God; that’s first. That’s where
       everything should be reverent, when that Word is going forth. And then he ran to the platform;
       he said, “You hypocrite,” said, “you snake in the grass.” He said, “I’ll show how much man of
       God you are,” said, “I’ll break every bone in your body.” 4 And I looked around to him, and I
       seen he was demon possessed. And I just led two little police to Christ, was back in the waiting
       room, the dressing room. And quickly, they rushed to the platform, I motioned to them. It wasn’t
       
       44
       a flesh and blood affair; it was between spirit power. And I just went ahead with the, started with
       the message, and these ministers, three hundred of them, started shrinking back. Brother Baxter
       was present, setting there. I had just had been made acquainted with him. Many ministers I
       guess, that you all would know. And Doctor Wyatt, you remember him? He’s—he was there. And
       Booth, Brother Booth-Clibborn, you remember he was there, and many of them that’s around the
       Portland, Ore—the area. And oh, what a fellow that was. He turned around he said, “You
       hypocrite,” said, “you deceiver,” he said, “you stand up here and act like that before those
       people and pose yourself to be a man sent from God.” Said, “I’ll show you how much you’re
       sent from,” said, “I’ll break every bone in your frail body tonight.” 5 Well, physically speaking,
       he was certainly able to do it. And he weighed at nearly three hundred pounds I suppose, about
       six foot two, and arms about like that. And his eyes was set, and his teeth scissored together. I
       just kept on speaking. And he rushed towards me, run over to me, said, “I’ll break every bone in
       your body.” And I turned around to look at him… Now, you better be sure you know what you’re
       talking about in them times. There’s no chance there for you to, just to bluff yourself; you better
       just let God have His way. So I… He told me; He promised me when He sent me, that He’d take
       care of me; so it’s up to Him to do it. You see? I just… Now, I… And He will do it, every battle.
       So I turned around to him; I just stood there a few moments, just a second or two, and he called
       me a snake in the grass again, a hypocrite. And I never said nothing, and just looked up again,
       he said, “Tonight I’ll break every bone in your body.” And he said, “Hawk! Pfft!” He spit right
       in my face, like that. And I started to say something. “I wouldn’t do that friends,” I was going to
       say that. Instead of that, the Angel of the Lord come whirling down and said, “Tonight you’ll fall
       over my feet; you’ll bow to the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.” 6 Now, that wasn’t me, that was
       God. So both made their prophesies. Both made their challenges, both spirits. Now, who was
       right was the next thing. He said, “I’ll show you how much your feet I bow to.” And he run
       forward like that and drew back his big fist. And everybody was just spellbound. Course all those
       demons setting there, that was their legion. I’m sure I’m talking to spiritual people. That was
       legions; it all went into this fellow. Like Goliath in the day of old. And he was, oh, he made that
       bold challenge, and he rushed forward, said, “I’ll see whose feet I fall over.” And he drew back
       his big fist like that. I said, “Satan, come out of the man.” And when he did he went… He made a
       great big scream, threw up his hands, his eyes went way out like that, and fell around till the
       police had to pull him off of my feet where he pinned me to the floor. They said, “Is that man
       dead?” I said, “No.” “Well,” said, “is he healed?” I said, “No. It’s just God showing His power
       to make that demon bow to Him.” That was all. See? I said, “He’s not dead.”
        So, see how easy it is for the devil to trick you? Now you’ll pray for me along that line. See
       that’s hard, that’s real hard to go out and preach revelation because those spirits are there. You
       may not know exactly where they are but sometimes you may. But see, without the real
       supernatural power of God, YOU’RE A FOOL, you’re a fool to try to challenge the devil or try
       to cast out devils or reveal evil things, you see.
        How many want to see something real again? (Amen) We’ll never see the real genuine real
       power of God, like we seen in the prophet until we come somewhere a group of people that come
       and face the facts. And as far as I know you’re the only group of people that’s facing the facts
       across the country. And you’ll be the only one that’ll get it, I mean first! You’re bound to get it.
        Now how many that helped you, let’s see? (Amen) Now, the great danger is, knowing that
       you’re on the out-side of the body, it ought to scare you if you seen a vision. It ought to scare
       
       45
       you if you hear a voice. Because you don’t have enough of the spirit of God to know which is
       which hardly. And there’s the big danger, see.
        Look! For years, I didn’t tell things that I seen and kept them to myself. My own wife could
       tell you a few things. She could tell you a few things, of the hell of literal hell I went through.
       And if it hadn’t been for God, we’d of went into an insane asylum. Sweating them out, knowing
       that everything had to coincide with that major prophet. And He wasn’t saying nothing about it. I
       waited for as much as ten to eleven years to see them line up with the word of God. Eleven years
       the devil pounded me brother, unmerciful no mercy at all on me. And if it wasn’t the tender
       loving hand of God, your pastor would of done died in an insane asylum and locked up in a
       closed ward a long time ago.
        So, don’t tell me nothing about all them visions and everything, I know better than that. I
       know better! It takes the supernatural power of God and a gift from God to see genuine visions.
       And that gift will make room for itself. It’ll make itself known. But there’s all kinds of things
       that can happen outside of the body of Christ and it’ll end up in disaster.
        So, how many think it’s safer to wait for the real thing? (Amen) Because what it’ll do
       see…God knows! I’ve been accused of being a Nicolaitane. That I want to take power over the
       laity where they can’t have miracles and see visions. God is that true? (No) People say that about
       me! But in my heart, I’m not doing that! What I’m trying to do? I’m trying to get you wired up
       right so that you can have something that’s Genuine! THAT YOU CAN SHAKE THE WORLD
       WITH IT! And God will give it to you to. See, it’s just got to be wired up right.
        Now, I got one more thing…I got lots of things here, but I’ll never get to it will I? Now I got
       to get some of it. I got to get this here, so you can refer back to it on tape. Now can I leave that
       part of it? Let’s see your hands. You got that real solid? (Amen)
        Now you may be sitting there …Now, let me clear this up.
       Usually if your called and the Lord God…When you just first meet the Lord and he’s just
       blessing you real good and the spirit is real fresh on you, there’s where you can see some real
       genuine things. But now as you go on see, you won’t have the supernatural. Because you
       see…Now let me show you why? Look here! For a person to have visions and to have the great
       power of God on them, and have the great leadership of the holy ghost, He’s Got to Positively
       Have the Wire in Him! How can God pull a switch, pull that power through you to see that
       vision when you’re not even wired up right in here? It’ll blow out! If God did do it, it would
       blow you up. You won’t…
        I’ll tell you why? If God shows this man a vision here, that didn’t have a Revelation or even if
       he just had faith… If God will continually show that man visions and speak to him in an audible
       voice, give him perfect leadership of the holy ghost, it’d blow his head up till it would be that
       BIG!! He would be so full of pride, self-exalted that he would destroy him own self.
        Do you think I would give my little Timmy or Mark when he was five years old…Now Mark
       gets on me all the time about using him. “What do you do that for” He says! Well, let me show
       you something. I instructed him about squirrel hunting and about the rifle. I said, “Son that thing
       looks innocent, but the thing that comes out the end of that Barrel it is only that big, but it will
       put a hole from one side of your head and out the other and I’ll have to preach your funeral. I
       said, “keep that thing pointed down to the ground! Keep it pointed down to the ground and check
       it to see if there anything in it all the time’ Well, he wasn’t but a little ole fella. I said, “Now
       we’re going squirrel hunting son. Here’s this dangerous weapon.” We go out, we go out
       there…Now he’ll probably get me when I get home. But I just want to make a point. We got out
       there and get out of the car and I’m loading my gun up and I looked over and here he is looking
       
       46
       right down the barrel of the gun! And it’s loaded! He said, “What’s the matter?” I said, “What’s
       the matter? What’s the matter?” I said, “Son what are you doing with your eye ball on the end of
       that barrel? Don’t you know if that thing goes off, it would blow a hole clear through your
       head!” He said, “Well, what’s the use of getting so excited about it, dad!”
        Now do you think that God almighty, is gonna give you all that great supernatural power to
       see visions and to cast out devils, to raise the dead when you’re not even wired up right? Without
       age with maturity with virtue, with knowledge, with patience, with knowledge, with godliness,
       with brotherly kindness, he wouldn’t be much of a father, would he? Now how many is thankful
       that he don’t let you see all that now? (Amen) Do you know why he don’t let you see them?
       Because, he loves you! He don’t want to destroy you. All God’s heart desire is, to get the best
       that he can to you. But he’s got a provided way to bring it.
        All right, the reason why we don’t see these great powers in the church and in the people, is
       because we are not sealed. And the reason why that we can’t have these genuine things, is
       because…is because we are not ready for it. We must mature up to real adults, then God can trust
       you, not to look down the barrel. He can trust you to handle his power. You won’t reach out and
       say, I got this and I got that and show off see.
        Remember Brother Branham got in trouble about that. “And the 3rd Pull will be no show off
       at all”

       390 Is this the mystery, of the Thunders, that will bring back the Headstone? You know, the
       pyramid never was capped. The Headstone is yet to come. It’s been rejected. Could it be,

       The First Pull, you remember what happened? I tried to explain It. He said, “Don’t do that.”
       393 The Second Pull, He said, “Don’t try.” And I pulled, anyhow. You remember?
       [Congregation says, “Yes.”—Ed.] All of you remember. It’s on tape and everything. 394 And

       speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored, placed entirely ready for the
       rapture in the resurrection, the Son of man. This is so, or is it not? And you would do this if

       56-0408A - What Is A Vision?
       William Marrion Branham
       
       110 And then I went in, farther into the vision. And when it did, I was standing with, you know, a
       little baby’s shoe, of about a year old. You know, the little bitty eyelets; not a bootee, but a—a
       shoe. And I had a—a string in my hand, trying to lace this little eighth-of-an-inch hole in this
       eyelet, with about a half-inch string. Just working fervently, trying to push that string through,
       that half-inch string, through an eighth-of-an-inch eyelet. And I was breaking the threads all
       over, the string, trying to push it through like that. And it just wouldn’t do it. And the string was
       being all broke up, on the end. 111 So, just then I heard Someone say, behind me, “Don’t you
       understand that you can’t teach babies supernatural things?” I looked around. And It was
       behind me. And I recognized that Voice. He said, “You’re using the wrong end of the string.”
       112 And I looked down at the end of the string laying on the floor, a great pile of string, and it
       was laced down to a nice eighth of inch, so it would go through the hole. I said, “I understand.”
       113 And as I reached to pick up the string, I was taken again. Now, you mark this down. Watch it
       come to pass. See? And as I—I started to reach down, I was gone again. Then, when I come to, I
       was standing by the side of a beautiful lake, something like your lake out here in the summertime
       when it’s real pretty and green. And there were fishermen all around the lake, and they were
       fishing, but they were catching small fishes. And I looked out into the lake, and those great,
       beautiful rainbow trout out there, and I said, “I know this is a vision, but I can’t understand
       those trout. But,” I said, “you know, I believe, right down in my heart, I can catch those.” So, I
       picked up the string, but, instead of it being a string, it was a fishing pole. 114 And just then, the
       One behind me said, “Now I’ll teach you to fish, how to catch those.” And so He took…And He
       said, “Tie on the lure.” And I snapped the lure on. He said, “Now throw way out,” now listen
       close, “way out into the deep.” And He said, “When you do, now let the lure sink down, first.
       Then,” said, “pull it slow.” Now, that’s really fishermen’s technique. So I… 115 He said, “Then,
       when you do, now, you’ll feel some nibbles at it, but don’t tell nobody what you’re doing. Keep it
       to yourself.” And said, “Then when you—when you feel it nibble again,” said, “pull it just a
       little, a little bit, but not too hard,” He said, “and then it’ll pull it away from the little fish. And
       when they scatter, that’ll attract the attention of the big fish, and they’ll grab it.” And said,
       “That’s the way you’ll catch it.” Said, “Then, when they bite, on the third time, set your hook for
       the—the catch.” I said, “I understand.” Said, “But keep still. Don’t tell nobody. Keep still.” And
       I said, “All right.” 116 I had the lure in my hand. And all these fishermen turned out to be
       ministers, and they all come around, saying, “Brother Branham, I know you can catch fish.” 117
       Oh, of course, that made me feel real good. I said, “Oh, yes, I’m a fisherman. I can catch fish.”
       And he said…I said, “Now, here is the way you do it.” And I said, “You throw it way out.” And I
       went way out, in to the—to the deep water. I said, “Now, those little fish are fine, brethren, but
       we want the big ones, too.” And I—I said, “See when it sinks down. Now see, there it is, just
       about where it should be. Now, see there, see there. There, them is little fish.” I said, “Now,
       when they stretch again…” 118 I give it a great big jerk, and, when I did, I pulled the whole lure
       out of the water. And when I did, I caught a fish, but I wondered how he ever got the lure in his
       mouth. Cause, looked like the skin just stretched over the lure, about the same size of the lure.
       And I thought, “Oh, my!” 119 And just then, this One Who had been talking, behind me, stepped
       around in front of me. It was Him, the Angel of the Lord. He had His hands folded. He looked at
       me, said, “Just what I told you not to do!” And I said, “Yes. That’s right.” 120 He said, “You
       
       48
       see, that First Pull was when you use to put your hands on the people and tell them what was
       their trouble.” Said, “The Second Pull was when you’d know the secrets of the heart, like I told
       you.” And said, “Instead of you keeping that to yourself, you tried to explain all about it, and tell
       people. And when you did,” said, “you didn’t know nothing about it, yourself. And how could
       you explain it? And you’ve caused a big bunch of carnal impersonations to rise up, and you see
       what you’ve done.” 121 And I said, “Lord, I’m sorry.” And I—I said, “Oh, I’m so sorry! I don’t
       know what to do.” 122 And I was pulling the line, like this, and I was trying to straighten my line
       out. And He looked at me, said, “Now, don’t get your line tangled up, in these kind of times.”
       123 I thought, “Maybe He’s going to give me another try.” And I was…I said, “I’ll sure be
       careful.” And was winding my line in, seen it taken up all right. 124 And then when He said that,
       just then I felt myself go higher, way up. And when I was set down, then I was beneath, and
       standing up above, a great tent. I never seen such a tent! 125 And I had just made an altar call,
       seeming like, down at the altar. And when I was down there, I looked, and there was hundreds of
       people standing around the altar, weeping, because they had accepted the Lord Jesus. And they
       were just weeping, out loud. And I said, “Oh, that’s more like it, like that.” 126 And a real kind
       gentleman walked out to the platform, said, “While Brother Branham is resting, just a few
       moments,” he said, “we’ll call the prayer line.” And said, “Everyone with prayer cards
       beginning with a certain number, stand over, on to the right.” Well, I noticed the prayer line,
       seemed like it went all around the tent, and out, and down the street. Such a prayer line! 127 And
       I looked over, which was then to my left; and that would be to my right, if I was standing on the
       platform, would be that way. There’s a piece of canvas stretched there. And in behind this
       canvas was a little, square building, about twelve-foot across and twenty-foot long, something
       like that. Well, I stood and looked at that. 128 And I seen them bringing a lady up, on a stretcher.
       And there was a lady there taking her name and things, with a…on a—on a paper. And so
       there’s someone come and got her, and pushed her through. And the next man come through,
       was with crutches. I see them go through that little building. 129 And on the outside, the lady
       come out, screaming to the top of her voice, pushing this stretcher. And the… 130 Then there
       was another lady on the other side, looked like kind of a dark-haired woman, and she said,
       “What happened?” 131 She said, “I just don’t know.” She said, “I couldn’t tell you what
       happened.” She said, “I have been paralyzed for twenty years. And, looky, I—I feel like I—I—I
       never was sick.” 132 And just then, out come the man, leaping and jumping, with his—with his
       crutches in his hand. And I—I looked at that. And just then… 133 Now, here is something. Notice
       close. There’s a difference between the Angel of the Lord and that Light. Because, I heard
       something a moving, as It does when It comes here at the platform, at night, kind of like a
       “Whew! Whew! Whew!” and like a Fire whipping around, licking blaze. And It left me, and It
       went right down over the top of that audience, and went and stood over the top of that little
       building, then settled down on top of it. And then, when It did, this One that was standing by me,
       behind me, the same Voice, the Angel’s Voice, He said, “I’ll meet you in there. And this is the
       Third Pull, but nobody will know nothing about it.” 134 And I said, “Well, I don’t understand.
       Why in there? Why that?” He said, “It will not be a public show, this time.” 135 And I said, “I
       don’t understand, going into that closet like that.” 136 And He said, “Is not It written by our
       Lord, ‘When thou prayest, be not like the hypocrites who like to be heard before men. But enter
       into the secret closet and pray to the Father Who seeth in secret; and He Who seeth in secret
       shall reward thee openly’?” It’s perfectly to the Scripture. Every time, it is. And I said, “I
       understand.” 137 Then He took me to this place, and set me down in this room where I was at.
       And then He told me what to do for the third time. Now, Christian friends, that will, when I leave
       
       49
       this world, that will still be in my bosom. When I…But, you mark my words, what’s going to take
       place. 138 When, that—that was five months ago, six months now, and we had no idea we’d ever
       go to—to down here at Mexico.
        That’s why…that’s why that Brother Branham in the later part of his ministry, said while he
       prayed for the sick said, “Bow your head, every head bowed and every eye closed and cursed be
       the man or the woman that raises their eyes.”
        And after the miracle took place he said, now you can raise your head. You can see she’s
       well. Why? Because the power of miracles signs and wonders is not givin to make a public show
       of. So, brother all I can say sisters let us humble ourselves before the Lord God. And say, “Lord
       God if it’s your will to use me, wire me up right and build me up right. Because those
       supernatural things of God, visions and miracles, signs and wonders and those supernatural
       things, without all this here (Bro. Lambert is pointing to the virtues of Christ in the Statue of a
       Perfect Man sign, hanging in the church) is a stumbling block to the person that you tell them to.
       Because they’ll see, that your evil nature is controlling you more than the Holy Spirit. And when
       your evil nature has more control over you more than the holy spirit, its disastrous to even talk
       about those things.

       E-68 Of course, any one can see there's a blind woman. I want you to bow your head. Cursed
       be the person that'll raise their eyes and look this way until they hear me say, "Raise your
       eyes." And I have faith, and let me alone with the woman.
       Jesus led a man outside the city. I don't have to see miracles to believe Him, but I believe in
       miracle raising God. Don't no one move. And you can suit yourself after I've said this. Keep your
       heads bowed till you hear my voice tell you to raise your head.
       Sister, blind man set by the gate, one day, begging. Jesus came along. God bless your heart. You
       want to see for the glory of God. Will you give God glory? I want you to close the lids over your
       eyes, like the rest of the audience. And only myself and the Holy Spirit Who is supernatural
       stands present. E-69 I was given a vision a few nights ago, concerning something. That's the
       reason I said, "Cursed be the person that would look this way or open their eyes before I ask for
       it."If you will believe, the blind spirit that's blinded those eyes will have to leave. Sight will
       appear through them. Now, have faith.

        Now I’m gonna close right here. Look quickly in John 4:23. I wish I could talk fast like
       Brother Mike Canada. He can more in 20 minutes then I can say in two hours and a half. That ole
       left hand never stops.
       John 4:23-Reference quote:
       23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit
       and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
        Notice here, “But the hour cometh, and now is,” The hour wasn’t there right then though, was
       it? (no) Now where was the believers at this time, of Jesus coming to the well at Samaria? Where
       was the believers? Was they believing on the Lord Jesus? Did they have fellowship with Jesus?
       (Amen) Was they walking in the light? But they was still on the outside of the body. And Jesus
       said here, “The hour cometh!” There is an hour coming! But, it’s not here yet. And now is! Now
       is a part of it was the work that he was doing then, see. “When the true worshippers shall
       worship the Father in spirit” How can you worship in the spirit, in the great supernatural spirit,
       until you come into that spirit? By one great holy ghost baptism into the body.
        Now notice here, “In the spirit and in the truth.” Now what we got here is part of that, has
       come to pass. Now is! It now is that we here believe… That’s what we believe that we are
       worshipping God “in the truth,” but not in the spirit.
        Now, let me clarify that. I believe the presence of the Holy Spirit is here. I Believe that you
       sitting here have a portion of the Holy Ghost. But we don’t have enough to sit in the spirit
       worshipping in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
        But I tell you one thing, Jesus said, “The hour is coming” And brother it come like a sound
       from heaven like a rushing mighty wind. And brother they begin to worship God in the spirit.
        Brother Branham said, “They was slobbering and their eyes were red, and they come down,
       abba! abba! abba! They was a mess. But they was worshipping in the spirit. So, full of it that
       their cup just running over. And brother it run over brother, it had…you cannot worship in the
       spirit and in the truth, that miracles signs and wonders and healings and cripples and everything
       without being healed. Now what do we do? We go and except it by faith.
       
       51
        We worship in the truth and we worship in the spirit and we’re sitting in heavenly places in
       Christ Jesus waiting for the resurrection to come it’s all over. And you can’t make the bible live,
       you can’t do nothing. How many is glad to take it like it is now? (Amen) Somebody is gonna
       worship in the truth and in the spirit.
        Notice here, now I’m gonna close on this here. 1 Corinthians 12:13. And you brothers that
       love doctrine. I’m gonna tie another knot, in that Token.
       1 Corinthians 12:13 let’s all quote that. “ For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body”
        That scripture 1 Corinthians 12:13 is the Latter Rain. Now brothers, preacher brothers, I got
       you hog tied both hands and feet. Oh, my! 1 Corinthians 12:13 is the Latter Rain. What is the
       latter rain? The latter rain is the harvest rain, that brings the fruit to the maturity. And Full
       maturity is perfection and perfection is 1 Corinthians 12:13 when you come into the body. And
       the latter rain is givin as the life to come to the seed. It’s the life giver to make the seed word
       live. Come on is, that right? (Amen) So, then the latter rain in 1 Corinthians 12:13 is one and the
       same. True? (Amen) What is it? 1 Corinthians 12:13 is none other than the power life of Christ
       baptizing you into his body for service. It’s the spirit giving you power to make the word in you
       live. That’s the latter rain.
        Oh, my! If that was noised out in the assemblies in this message it would vibrate across the
       country, wouldn’t it? How many believe that? (Amen)
        How many just let me make just one more statement? (Amen)
       Now notice here, that the Bible said that Abel…Now get this in closing. Won’t take but five
       minutes. Able offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice. Why did he offer unto God a more
       excellent sacrifice? Notice that God was pleased with Abel’s sacrifice. Notice that Able did not
       bring any fruit of the field. Fruit of the field is harvest. Now I see, you’re getting it. Notice that
       Cain brought the fruit of the field. What is fruit? Jesus said, “I’ve ordained you that you may
       bring forth fruit.” Signs, wonders, miracles the powers of God.
       John 15:16-Reference quote:
       16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring
       forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my
       name, he may give it you.

       72 But look, coming here, at Abel, not with working. Wrapped a little vine around this old
       sheep’s neck, and here he come pulling him up there, throwed him upon the altar and begin to
       beat his throat, and killed him. Why? Abel had a revelation. We’re letting that soak just a
       minute. It was a revelation that Abel had that made him just. He had a revelation of the
       requirement of Almighty God, and he brought a lamb. And that’s the only way that you’ll ever
       be able to see Divine healing, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it’ll be by revelation. When they
       come down off the mountain… Here it is, I’ll prove it. They come down off the mountain and
       Jesus said, “Who does man say I am?” Well, some of them said, “You’re Elias.” Other ones
       
       52
       said, “Why, You’re of the prophets.” Just like they try to tack now the coat of Elijah and so forth,
       all them things you know. They had the same spirits them day; they just living on today. 73
       “Some said, You’re Elias, and some say You’re the prophet, and some say You’re this or that or
       that or the other.” He said, “But who do you say I am.” Peter said, “Thou art the Christ the
       Son of the living God.” He said, “Blessed art thou Simon Barjona, for no seminary revealed
       this to you. No tholo—theologians ever revealed this to you. Not flesh and blood has not, but
       My Father which is in heaven. And upon this Rock I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell
       will not prevail against It.” What is it? The revelation of God. There you are. The… God
       reveals sinner truth in the Spirit. “Upon this Rock (the spiritual revelation of God) I’ll build
       My Church and the gates of hell can’t prevail against It.” So you can fight the holy-rollers, as
       you call them, all you want to; God’s Church will prevail right—go right on to end of time.
       Yes, sir.
        And that Cain spirit tried to bring visions and power and the glory of God the FRUIT,
       WITHOUT A REVELATION UPON THE WORD! BUT ABLE NEVER BROUGHT THE
       FRUIT! HE NEVER SAID, “LORD I SAW A VISION, I GOT THIS, I GOT THAT! HE
       BROUGHT THE BLOOD!!!! GLORY TO GOD! HE BROUGHT THE REVEALED WORD!
       And God loved Abel’s sacrifice and spoke from heaven and vindicated it!
        Notice at the same time, that God vindicated Abel’s blood sacrifice, HE JUST CAME!! And
       God said now, “Why are you mad at me, why are you wroth, why are you mad, why are you
       angry. IF THOU Doest not well, will not you be accepted?”
       Genesis 4:6-Reference quote:
       6 And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
       7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.
       And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
        “Oh, but Lord I saw a vision, I spoke in tongues, I cast out devils” Depart from me you
       worker of iniquity, I never did know you!
       Matthew 7:21-Reference quote:
       20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
       21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he
       that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
       22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
       name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
       23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
       
        But Abel offered up unto God a more excellent sacrifice and that is he had a revelation. What
       did he offer up? Blood! GOD DIDN’T WANT FRUIT! HE WANTED BLOOD! And that’s
       what he is wanting today. He wants blood first! And the Token the vindication, the sign, the seal
       of God, Comes to The Blood! It’ll never come to a vision! It’ll never come to signs wonders and
       miracles. It’s got to come by the bloody revealed word of God! And then God vindicates it!
        Let’s bow our heads. Now, if our sisters come to the organ and piano please. Oh children,
       how blessed we are, to be able to have an honest heart and to just accept these things. Every son
       
       53
       and daughter that comes to God must be tried and tested upon the word of God. “Line upon line,
       precept upon precept, hear a little bit and there a little bit, with stammering lips and another
       tongue” they’ll get it. How did it come? By the word of God! How is God gonna be faithful to
       his promise today? By the preaching of God’s word and by people that are believing in it and
       accepting it. That’s how he’ll do it.
       Isaiah 28:10-Reference quote:
       7 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest
       and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of
       the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
       8 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.
       9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that
       are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.
       10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a
       little, and there a little:
       11 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
        Now let us pray;
        Oh, great Eternal loving God. We thank thee and we praise thee for thy word. Oh Lord thy
       word is a lamp unto our feet Lord and a light unto our pathway God. Oh, Lord we’re so thankful
       for the evening light, that lights up our pathway that we may see how to walk. Oh God, we thank
       you for men and women Lord, that’s able to stand the chastisement the instruction of thy word
       Lord. Lord thou sayest in the last days, who can I teach knowledge to? Who can I teach doctrine
       to? Them that are weaned from the breasts. Oh God, we’re so thankful for people that’s willing
       to sit Lord and be taught the word of God. Heavenly father, we’re growing up together. Lord
       how we pray that you’ll help us to be wired up right. God wire us up right Lord. That there’ll be
       no blown fuses. Heavenly Father wire us up right, that the power of God will not just destroy us.
       Lord we see how so may ministers, are waiting for a burning lake of fire today. Is because they
       sought the power of God, sought the glory of God without offering the right sacrifice. Lord God
       we come to thee, poor in spirit Lord needy oh God. We come to thee offering the sacrifice the
       bloody revealed word of God. And praying Lord, that you’ll speak from heaven Lord and
       vindicate the sacrifice. God, we thank you that we’re able to receive it father. Bless us now, bless
       each and every person Lord in Jesus Name, amen.
        Let’s stand to or feet. What page is that? “307.” Start that off, Brother Shaw.
       Congregation sings. “Jesus Father of My Soul”
        My what a broken song. How many this morning…Oh friend, can’t you see the unsearchable
       grace of the Lord Jesus that saved a wretched sinner like us? How many now and forever, you
       just wanna except Christ the provided way and realize it’s by Grace are you saved through faith.
       The Grace of God. The Grace of God. There’s no good in us, it’s all in him. That’s why we must
       strive to come into him, see.
        As long as we stay outside here, we’ll never mount to nothing. We want to come into Christ.
       That’ll be the great body, that’ll the great resurrected raptured church. When that believing child
       of God, that comes Gods provided way. Now he’s your sacrifice! He’s your justifier! He’s your
       sanctifier! Now this ought to give you peace in your heart. He was delivered for our offenses! He
       was delivered for our offenses! He was raised again for your justification! And now we have
       peace, through that wrathful God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. I would to God that every
       
       54
       member in my congregation, that could anchor down in their soul. That you are resting in the
       finish works of Christ. And he promised, if you’d let him wire you up right, he’ll give you power
       for service. And then you’ll be a witness unto him, into all the world. You’ll not be a stumbling
       stone, you’ll be a living a living manifestation of Jesus Christ. When they see you, they’ll see
       him. You want that? (Amen) How many gonna take your pastor’s words away with you? Bless
       your heart! I believe when she winds up, you’ll see that it’s right. There’ll be another inaugurated
       church, just as sure as I’m standing here. It’s a law of God. If you wire the building up right,
       there’s a man here that can turn on the light, see.
        Now with our heads bowed. The Bible said, they sung a hymn and they went out. Let’s take
       this word of God out, and say, “Lord it’s true, help me oh God, to become your word. Lord I
       don’t want to resist the word of God. I don’t want to butt up against it buck it Lord. Try to make
       excuses for myself. But Lord. I’m poor in spirit, I’m needy Lord. I want to come into you!
       You’re my safe tower”
        Now with or heads bowed and our eyes closed. I’ll ask Brother Norman to dismiss us in a
       word of prayer. Remember the service tonight. I don’t know, Brother Bill are you preaching
       tonight? Your preaching, are you? I think Brother Bill is gonna minister for us tonight. Now let’s
       come tonight, not to just hear from Brother Bill. But let’s come tonight, that God’s presence
       would be among us and he would anoint Brother Bill that he would say something just for me.
       Something that would help me, then I would know that wasn’t Bill speaking, but God just let
       him say the words that I need.
        Now with our heads bowed with our eyes closed. Thank you for your wonderful attention and
       may the Lord Jesus bless you. And I love you. And may the hour soon arise, when you’ll come
       into that great, great body of Christ. And that’s all that we desire, is that great glorious day.
        Brother Norman! Prays closing prayer.
       Congregation sings dismissal song, “Take the Name of Jesus With You.”

         Opening prayer by: Robert Lambert
         Father God, oh, we’re so thankful for the Promise of the Hour, God. Oh, we’re so thankful
        that You loved us, and Lord, you give us grace to prove our love to You, God. We’ve forsaken
        all. Oh, Lord, how we love You! How we thank You, for the blessed hope that we have in the
        coming of the Holy Ghost, Lord, to give us power to get out of here, God, oh, we’re so thankful!
        We’re so thankful that You’ve not left us without a promise, without a leadership of the Holy
        Ghost. Oh, Thou art the Great & Mighty One, Lord, help us to keep our eyes upon Jesus only,
        Lord, for we realize, Lord, that in man and in this flesh dwelleth no good thing, but in the Lord
        Jesus Christ dwelleth every good gifts. Oh, how we adore Thee, how our souls magnify the
        Name of the Lord. Lord, we thank Thee for all the saints gathered here tonight around the
        coming of the Lord Jesus, the pouring out of His great promise. God, they’ve left houses and
        lands, and lots, and jobs and wives, husbands, and friends, neighbors and loved ones. Oh, God,
        give them the reward of a believer, Lord! Pour out the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. God, may it
        be tonight that You do this great thing that Thou hast promised, Lord. Bless us in the remainder
        part of the service. Bless us, lead us, and guide us. In Jesus Name. Amen.
         You may be seated. Do you love Him? I love Him with all my heart, all my soul, and all my
        mind. James said, “Show me your faith, and let me see your works then, faith without works is
        dead.” Jesus said, “He that has left houses, lands & lots, wives and brothers, and kindred, lands
        for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake shall receive a hundredfold in this life, and in the world to
        come.” God’s Word is true. God will never fail His Word. The great prophet, the immortal
        Elijah, Bro. William Branham, made this statement, said, “If you can find the place where the
        people of God are gathered around the Promise, and where the great Presence of the Lord Jesus
        is, he said, there you will find where God will pour out His Spirit.” You know, and I believe,
        when you see people that’s laying on the floor crying and weeping for the Lord Jesus to come,
        when you meet people like that, praising the Lord, weeping and crying, and singing with all their
        hearts, and clapping their hands, you’ll find God’s people.
        Matthew 22:37-Reference Scripture
        37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and

        James 2:14-24-Reference Scripture
        14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can
        faith save him?
        15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
        
        2
        16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye
        give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?
        17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
        18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works,
        and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
        19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
        20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
        21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the
        altar?
        22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
        23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto
        him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
        24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

        Now, blessed Lord, we as Your Church, as the—the Church of the living God, as this service
        tonight, Your people here that’s called by Your Name, You said, “If they will gather together
        and pray, then I’ll hear from Heaven.”
        
         You know back in Pentecost, they tried to work up the Holy Ghost with the piano, but you
        know they just couldn’t work Him up. It just didn’t have the sincerity to it. But, you know, you
        can’t fool God, and you can’t fool God’s people, and people shouldn’t clap and shouldn’t jump
        any higher than they’re living. But, when you find people that are living the life and are in love
        with the Lord, and sincere with your heart, then it’s a joy to see people clap their hands and pat
        their foot, and sing with all their heart. But it certainly is a stink in the nostrils of God to find
        assemblies across the country that raise their hands and praise God, and live like the devil, and
        sing the songs of Zion, and in a hurry to get home real quick to watch the Late Show on
        television. I believe this kind of praise and this kind of worship, and this kind of clapping your
        hands, it would be better if you’d just sit there, and didn’t do nothing.
         I’m so thankful for a people that’s called by His Name, that love His Promise and are waiting
        for His Promise, and I believe standing before me tonight are people that are preparing to receive
        the greatest Gift that has ever been given in 2,000 years, and I’m speaking of the great Gift of
        God, the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. You know, one of the most saddest things in this hour, is to
        find people in denominational churches and even people following the great prophet’s message
        William Branham, that is they have “devalued”, and you hear a lot about the word, devalued, and
        they have devalued the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, until they have devalued it so much, that
        
        3
        people are no longer willing to strive, and struggle and weep with tears and fasting, and prayers,
        all night prayer meetings to strive and struggle to enter in to the great Gift of God, the Baptism of
        the Holy Ghost. And, they have made it so easy, to receive that just anybody can live any way
        they want to, and just believe that Bro. William Branham is God’s prophet, and you got It!
         Brother, and sister, as long as there is a life left in my old feeble bones, I’m gonna tell the
        people that it’s going to take more than that to receive God’s great Gift! It’s going to cost you
        everything you hold dear in life. You’re going to have to lay it down to prove to Jesus, that you
        love Him more than you love anything in this world. And, I’m glad God set it up that way,
        because only Perfect Love for the Lord Jesus Christ will be able to enter in to that great Baptism,
        and only those that receive that great Baptism, will be the only ones that will be in heaven, that is
        the First Resurrection. So, now we put works to our faith, that if we really believe that God is
        getting ready to do this thing, then let’s act like it. Let’s act like it! If we act like it, we’ll live like
        it, we’ll talk like it, we’ll pray like it, we’ll come to church like it, everything about us will be
        centered around the Promise of God!
         When you find people that are centered around the coming of the Promise of God for this
        hour, then you’ll find God’s people, and when you find those people, then you will pattern your
        life after them. I find across the country, many times I don’t say nothing, but I kind of watch and
        look and listen, and I’m afraid that people are getting one another’s spirits, instead of getting the
        Holy Spirit. If you get the Holy Spirit, it will cause you to be like Christ! But, if you get one
        another’s spirit, then everybody will act like one another. We call that little clicks, and little
        “isms”, and “wasm’s”, you know.
         I don’t know where the “wasm’s” come from, I think it come out of Gainesville, Georgia, and
        incidentally that reminds me that, that left-handed preacher called me, and he was so on fire, I
        was feeling kind of down and I didn’t know if I could make it to service this morning. I heard
        some friend’s little sister Shirley, and mother our other sister, “that’s your Aunt”? and, I heard
        they was here and different ones. I had the flu, and the way I got up I thought, I’d just fall back
        down in to bed, the way I felt, but, I’m glad I came. You know, it’s just something about you
        may feel real bad, but when you get here, you feel much better. No matter how you feel, when
        you get here, you feel much better, so I’m glad I came. And, I tried to lay back down this
        afternoon and I got up and fell back down with hardly enough strength to even stand up, old legs
        about 100% weaker than they were. But I feel better already, just being
        here.
         And, we’re very thankful, I kind of, you know it makes me a little nervous when strangers
        come, and I kind of missed Shirley, and them, and I got to preaching, and looking down there so
        didn’t say anything just went on, we’re very happy to have little Shirley, and her mother our dear
        sister and Brother Jimmy’s Aunt. So, we’re glad to have them.
         You know they believe this Token Revelation, and they’re way down in the valley, down in
        Pennsylvania, the beautiful mountains there, and they love this Promise. And, I know Sister
        Shirley is looking forward to that great day when she’s gonna leave that old wheelchair and be
        made whole. You know, we’re kind of an afflicted little bunch here, Sister Shirley. We… I’m
        walking around on these ole spindly legs, but, God… I know He’s going to do it. He came to me
        like three times oh, about the last six months ago and showed me my new legs. So, I just feel
        good about it, and I know I’m going to get them. I know little Irma is looking forward to getting
        hers, and different ones. We’re an afflicted bunch. People say, well, if you’ve got anything,
        “Why don’t, why ain’t these great things happening?” Well, see, you don’t understand. First, you
        bear the reproach of barrenness. First, you’ve got to bear the reproach of being barren. You’re
        
        4
        barren of the power of God, you’re void of the power of God. But then you hunger and thirst
        after it, then you get It, and then God makes all, those that laughed at you, He makes them come
        and bow down before you, and worship the Lord for you.
        Revelation 3:9-Reference quote:
        9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but
        do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have
        loved thee.
         Did you know that’s a promise? Did you know that’s a promise? How many heard me quote
        that Promise many times? (Amen) Found right in the third chapter of Revelation. Said there
        would be a group of people, that little Bride, they’d find out that everybody that said, they have
        the Baptism of the Holy Ghost in this hour and the little Bride found them out to be liars. You
        believe that’s in the Bible? (Amen) It’s in the Bible. Found them out to be liars! And the little
        Bride went out and got the True Baptism of the Holy Ghost, and begins demonstrating It. And,
        Jesus said, “I’ll make all them that laughed at you, and said they had It, I’m going to make them
        come and get down on their knees before you, and worship Me, right down on their knees, and
        cry and beg for the same thing that you went after and got.” So, I’m thankful to be around a
        group of people like this! Thankful!
        Revelation 2:2-Reference quote:
        2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which
        are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them
        liars:
        Revelation 3:9-Reference quote:
        9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but
        do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have
        loved thee.
        Isaiah 60:14-Reference quote:
        14 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that
        despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city
        of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
         So, we, find that you find a group of people that’s contending for that great Promise, and are
        waiting in love for God to come and do the Thing that He Promised. Then you’ll find an
        atmosphere of Faith. And, it takes the life of the Holy Ghost to create an atmosphere of Faith.
        And, we, find an atmosphere of Faith, and that’s where you’ll find God is going to do the thing
        that He promised. And, when you can hear the people crying, and their hands up in the air, and
        you hear them praying and crying, and the thing that they’re praying and crying for, that’s the
        thing you’re going to receive. See? In every hour, God’s people, He’s seen to it, that they prayed
        and cried and sought Him for the thing that He was going to do in their hour. And, if, you read in
        the history, and in the Bible, you’ll find out that He did the very thing they cried and prayed for.
        
        5
         Now, if you find a group of people that believe it’s all over, then you’ll never find God ever
        move with that group of people. See? He can’t move there, because they don’t believe He is
        going to do anything. So, if I was searching for God, do you know what I would do? I’d find a
        people that’s looking for God to do something. Wouldn’t you? You know, I often said like this,
        “well, Lord, what if I’m wrong, Lord?” Just say, what if I’m wrong? And I told all these people
        wrong, and they really have got the power of God, they really have the Seal of God, they really
        have got the nine gifts of the Spirit, they really have got the nine fruits of the Spirit, they really
        are raising the dead and opening the blind eyes, and yet, I can’t find it nowhere, and I’ve told
        them wrong? But Lord, when I met them, they wasn’t praying.
         Lord, when I met them, they wasn’t seeking You. Lord, when I met them, they wasn’t striving
        to overcome, they had all kinds of things in life that was wrong. But, Lord, At least, I’ve
        convinced them that they’ve got to live a better life, they’ve got to overcome themselves. So, you
        know, I got to thinking, well, if I do make a mistake, it will be a good one. Now, on the other
        hand, I said, “Lord, now, what if I’m right, though, and the other preachers are wrong, and those
        people never overcome themselves, they never strive and struggle to overcome the things in their
        life that they should, and they go on confessing they got It, and can’t demonstrate It, and, then I
        go ahead and tell them they got It, lie to them, and then, I said, Jesus come to me in that Day and
        say, “You’ve seen those signs wasn’t following, Bob, you’ve seen they had all them things in
        their life, and you never preached against them, you told them they was all right, and had It, and
        was ready to go, so, now they’ve gone to hell, and so have you.” You know, I thought, that
        would be a terrible mistake to make. I think, I’ll just go on telling everybody, they ain’t got It!
        How many think that would be better? Get them praying, get them seeking God, get them
        overcoming. You know, I believe one of these days I believe God is gonna do a Thing in the
        earth that is gonna surprise people, don’t you? I believe they are gonna find out that it really
        wasn’t over after all!

        59-1217 - What Was The Holy Ghost Given For?
        William Marrion Branham
        When you accept Christ as your personal Saviour, you are believing unto the baptism of the
        Holy Ghost. That is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost, my dear Baptist brethren. It is wrong.
        A brother said to me the other day, said, “Brother Branham,” or some time ago, months ago, he
        said, “Brother Branham, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
        righteousness.” I said, “Truly.” Said, “What more can a man do than believe?” 63 I said,
        “That’s all a man can do. That’s all he can do today, is believe God. But God gave him a seal of
        circumcision,” that we went through last night, “AS A SIGN THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED HIS
        FAITH IN HIM.” AND, TODAY, UNTIL GOD… YOU BELIEVE UNTO HIM WHEN YOU
        ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOUR. BUT WHEN GOD GIVES YOU THE
        SEAL OF THE HOLY GHOST, HE SEALED YOU TO YOUR ETERNAL DESTINATION.

        275 How do you get in the Church? [Congregation says, “Born.”—Ed.] Born. What by? The
        Breath of God. Breathe on me, Breathe on me; Spirit of the living God, Breathe on me. 276
        That’s my prayer: just let the Holy Spirit breathe. Oh, my! For, the Breath of God, what is It?
        Sealed away in the Kingdom of God, knowing that, when I first confessed, I believe Jesus Christ.
        Yeah. Then, to my Faith, I add virtue, godly virtue. Then to my virtue, I add knowledge of the
        Word. 277 To my knowledge, I add temperance, self-control. I like that. “My country ’tis of thee,
        crown my soul with self-control, from sea to shining sea.” See? 278 Patience. Oh, my! Tested.
        Don’t you worry; Satan will count them for you. I’m climbing up the ladder now. See? I’ve
        added virtue, knowledge, temperance, now I’ve got to add patience. I still ain’t got the Holy
        Ghost. 279 Then after I add patience, I add godliness. You know what that is? Like God. I add
        that. Don’t misbehave myself. Go like a Christian gentleman ought to. Let that not be a put-on.
        Something in me, the love of God, just boiling. See? See? Not say, “Uh-uh-uh-uh, boy, I could do
        it, but maybe I better not.” See? Huh-uh. Huh-uh. It’s there, anyhow. 280 It’s a Birth. I been
        birthed into this, into this, into this, into this, into this, into this, into this. And then the love of
        God, Christ, comes down and seals all that up in me, for service. See? 281 Then what does He
        do when He gives me the Holy Ghost? He sets you out in a separate place to yourself, marks
        you. See? You’re a different person then. You’re not of the world, no more. See? You’re
        clothed different. You’re dressed different. Not this outside dress. No, no. You don’t have to be
        odd and peculiar, and collar turned around, and a long ceremony, like. No, no. You don’t do
        that. You dress, physically, like this. It’s the spiritual dress that counts. The wedding garment has
        been put on you. What are you? 282 Like Jesus, watch, He was overshadowed, and He was
        transfigured there before them, and His raiment shined like the sun. There He was, Jesus, God
        placing His Own Son. See? And then up come Moses. Then up come Elijah. And Peter said,
        “You know, it’s—it’s a good thing to be here.” See how man gets? Yeah. Oh, the supernatural
        done! Said, “Let us build three tabernacles. Let’s build one for Moses, and one for Elijah, and
        one for You.” 283 And before he got through speaking, God just shut the whole thing up, said,
        “This is My beloved Son. In all these things that I required of Moses, and put the law out by
        Moses; the justice by the prophets; He has met it all. Hear ye Him. I’ll step out of the picture
        now. Just hear Him. Just hear Him.” Oh, my! What a beautiful thing! 284 THEN, WHEN WE
        HAVE MET THESE QUALIFICATIONS, AND BECOME FULL OF THE VIRTUES OF
        GOD AND THE THINGS OF GOD, THEN THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES DOWN AND
        SEALS US INTO THE KINGDOM. DON’T WORRY. EVERYBODY WILL KNOW YOU
        GOT IT. YOU WON’T HAVE TO SAY, “WELL, GLORY TO GOD, I KNOW I GOT IT. I
        spoke with tongues. Glory to God, I know I got It. I danced in the Spirit once.” YOU WON’T
        HAVE TO SAY A WORD ABOUT IT. EVERYBODY WILL KNOW YOU GOT IT. DON’T
        YOU WORRY. YEAH. IT’LL TESTIFY FOR ITSELF. HE WILL LET IT BE KNOWN
        AMONG MEN.
         You know, we’ve just been blessed to have Bro. Kuhn, Bro. Tyler, Bro. Richard Tyler with
        us, Bro. Taylor, is it? Taylor. I almost had it right. It’ll just take me a few more weeks, I’ll get it
        right, brother. You know, we’re not too smart around here. God tries to use what little bit we’ve
        
        7
        got, but we’ve been very happy to have Bro. Kuhn and Bro. Taylor with us, and I just thought,
        Shirley said, “Honey, I just never seen you talk so much in all my life, I didn’t think you was
        ever going to take us to dinner.” So, we talked out front about an hour, and we went over to the
        cheap steak place in Middletown, talked out front, got inside, and talked all the way up through
        there, and Shirley said, “You’re talking too loud.” But, Bro. Kuhn, he was talking louder than I
        was. So, I just went on talking anyway, I didn’t care. You know what I talk about, I don’t care
        who hears it. I believe what we’re talking about, everybody needs to hear about it. Don’t you?
         So, we got in there, and I don’t even remember eating steak. And, we was talking about
        Baptism of the Holy Ghost, New Birth, and everything else, and Bro. Richard kept saying all the
        time, “I’m hungry for Truth, I’m seeking Truth.” Bro. Kuhn finally said, “You know, I believe
        that Great Pearl of great price” …I said, “Oh, you’re near the Kingdom!” Talking about nearing
        the Kingdom, when you talk about that Pearl of great price. So, I feel awful blessed of the Lord
        to have our precious brothers come be with us.
         And, we ain’t got nothing to join, as Bro. Branham said, “join,” we ain’t got nothing to join,
        nothing to join here, we’re just a people that’s come from all over the country, hungering and
        thirsting for God, and we’re just a people that found out we really didn’t have what we thought
        we had. But, really want to get what the Bible has for us. One thing for sure, we’re waiting in
        love for God to come and do the Thing that He promised to do. And, we love Him, that He’d
        count us worthy to reveal this great Revelation to us.

        489 It goes right by them, and they don’t recognize it till it’s gone. It only picks up the
        predestinated Seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the earth. The same thing
        come through in the days of Noah, same thing come through in the days of Moses, days of
        Elijah, days of the prophets, days of Jesus, on down through and to this very hour. The
        pregnated person with the Seed of God, the Word in there manifesting Itself, so surrendered to
        the will of God that the Word, and the Word alone, manifests Itself in this person, the
        prisoner, to an individual. 490 Not say, “My church…” Now, “my church” has nothing to do
        with it. 491 IT’S AN INDIVIDUAL, ONE PERSON! ALL HELL IS AGAINST THIS
        TEACHING. ALL HELL IS AGAINST THIS TRUTH, BUT IT IS THE TRUTH. 492 Jesus
        never said, “Now, Peter, you and John, and all the rest the people, YOU’VE GOT THE
        REVELATION, NOW THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SAVED.” No. 493 It was to him,
        personally. “I say unto thee, thee,” not to them, “to thee, thou art Peter; upon this rock I’ll build
        My Church.” And the word Peter, means “a stone.” Stone means “the confessed one,” or, “the
        separated one.” 494 Upon a certain stone, upon a certain thing; see, a called-out, the Church
        called out; upon this stone, upon this “revelation.” “Flesh and blood never revealed it to you.
        But upon this revelation, called-out group, I’ll build My Church in them. And all the gates of
        hell will never be able to withstand it.” 495 “Not one hair of your head shall perish. You are
        Mine! I’ll raise you up in the last day, give unto him Eternal Life, and raise him up at the last
        days.” There it is, the revelation. Not them; but “him,” an individual! NOT A GROUP; AN

         That we, with Faith and Patience, we could wait here, week after week, month after month,
        since 1967, we’ve been waiting in this little store front building, waiting for God to come and do
        the Thing that He’s Promised. And, we look back and see how God has led us.
        How God has led us different ones, like Bro. Teddy and Bro. Stanley from all the way over in
        Yugoslavia. Led them by the Holy Ghost all the way over here, and they’ve never moved from
        the first time they’ve come heard this, Revelation. They’ve set real quietly.
         I remember when Bro. Teddy, first come, he never clapped his hand, he never patted his foot,
        he just cocked that head sideways like that, reminded me of an old eagle, you know, turn it up
        sideways like that, and turn it back like that, and the next thing you know, one day I was
        preaching and all I could see was hands. And, so, well, you know the rest. I never will forget the
        other day, over on the old boat, I was setting there thinking about the little assembly, and how I
        love you. I was thinking about Bro. Teddy, and I, we was all hot and tired working around on
        that old motor. A guy tried to skin my head on an old fishing boat, and he thought he’d skin my
        head, but he turned out he got his head skinned. Little brothers jumped in there, and found us
        traveling with the boat, and God just blessed us and give us a little old boat, we could never
        afford it, but God just blessed us, gave us a little boat to fish on.
         And, I was sitting there on that little old boat, and I got thinking about Bro. Teddy, and I, was
        thinking on him in my heart, and I thought, Lord, You were awful good to us to send Bro. Teddy
        all the way from Yugoslavia, and God knows how he lays on the floor and weeps and cries and
        prays for the ministry, agonize and travail with God with tears and crying for Him to come and
        do this great Thing. And, I believe…and I believe God sent Bro. Teddy all the way here from
        Yugoslavia. How many believe that? (Amen) I never will forget that night, I just thought God
        was ready to do this great Thing, that He’s gonna do, and when the planets come together, and
        God led us here in these all-night prayer meetings. And, I was just worried to death, afraid God
        would pour out His Spirit before daylight, and Bro. Teddy would miss It. And, I was praying,
        “God, send Bro. Teddy, scared to death, afraid he wasn’t going to get here, and lo, and behold,
        all at once, kept praying, and the door opened, and here he come, and I tell you, the power of
        God struck this building. How many remember that? Oh, my, didn’t He come through this
        building!
         And, what that is, that we love one another with such a love, that God just bears witness of
        that love, see? Hereby, will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for
        another.

        John 13:34-35-Reference Scripture:
        34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye
        also love one another.
        35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
         And, I have in all my life, I have never seen a group of people gathered under one roof, that
        has such hospitality, generosity, and had such devotions to God, and such love to God, and such
        love to one another, as you people right here. I’ve never seen the likes of it, and I’ve tried to start
        groups all over the United States. And, oh brother, God’s servant Bro. Gatlin, Bro. Mike Canada,
        and that little Bro. Mike Canada called me the other night, and he was so on fire. He said, “I got
        to put that tent up, this Revelation is just busting me and burning me up, said, “I just got to get
        out there and tell It.” “I can’t stand it any longer.” And, he’s ready to come back again, he’s got a
        guy down there, that’s got an airplane, and he told him, he said, “If you want to see a church, if
        you want to see a church, I want you to go up to New England, you’ve never seen nothing like it,
        and you’ll never be the same again.” So, he’s going to fly him up.
         So, I think they’re going to fly in on American next weekend. Then, he’s got two more
        brothers he’s told about you, and they’re going to drive Bro. Mike up. So, I don’t know, looks to
        me like he’s gonna be here all Fall. Might be better, maybe just pack his bags and move on up
        here.
         So, how many love Bro. Canada? He’s God’s servant. God’s children love God’s servants.
        When they tell them God’s, truth, then they realize they’re God’s servants, and they love God’s
        servants. And, so, he’s just burning up with this message down there, and of course, he don’t
        have hardly anybody to believe it, but he just tells them anyway, and everything is just going
        wrong with everybody down there. They’ve turned against It. This, group splits here, and then
        splits again, you know, and just keeps on splitting you know. And, Bro. Mike, he keeps saying,
        alright you know, Bro. Bob, I have that little sign that Bro. Kevin made, and everyone down here
        wants one of them signs, “Ye Must Be born Again”! And, so, they were wondering if they
        couldn’t send Bro. Kevin some money, he could make some more of those signs, “Ye Must Be
        Born Again”! And he said, “I’ve got that sign right in my door, and he said, “I’m just waiting for
        some of these people that claim to believe the Message to come in and look at that sign,” and he
        said, “I’m going to preach It to them. He’s got it right on the wall.” Oh, he’ll do it, too, I’ll tell
        you that. And, so, Bro. Mike, remember him in prayer. He’s just striving and struggling down
        there, and he’s an Evangelist, you know.
         Michael is an evangelist. The first time I’ve ever seen him come here and preach, I said, in
        my heart, “Lord, that’s Your evangelist.” Now, that’s the only man that I ever met, of course, I
        know other fine preachers, and I respect them and everything. But, to me in my heart, you know,
        I just when I saw him minister, I said, “Now there’s God’s evangelist right there.” And, to me,
        Bro. Mike is really an evangelist, he’ll never prosper as a pastor, he’ll never do it.” And, I
        believe God is going to use Bro. Mike, and send him around the world. Just wait and see now,
        just wait and see what I’m telling you, that God will one day will raise that man up, put His
        Spirit upon him, and send him around the world with this message. He’ll sure do it. And, so, he’s
        having a hard time trying to find God’s position, and place right now cause he’ll not find it right
        now, but, later on he will. He just lives to get back up here; he has such a love for you. Even in
        talking to me, he acted like that I didn’t even know you. He just talks, he say’s Bro. Bob, I’ve
        never seen anything like it, he just goes on, and on, he must have talked about fifteen dollars’
        worth and I noticed, so God bless his precious heart, we love him real dearly, so, remember him
        
        10
        in prayer. It’s just hard for him to even hang up when he calls. Maybe he’ll be here next
        weekend. And, those people, we’ll just pray that God will help them when they come.
         I just wonder if Bro. Kuhn wouldn’t get up and say something for the Lord. He’s certainly
        is… if I’ve ever met two humble men of God, these people are certainly humble, and course, me,
        I’m just pouring everything I could right down both, they’re just like a sponge, they’re just
        soaking up everything, you know, and I certainly find just meeting them this morning, very
        humble, and from what I understand they’re going around seeking, trying to find…trying to find
        knowledge, trying to find truth. They know something is amiss, trying to find out what can they
        get to satisfy their soul. Of, course, you know what I… my little two cents. I said, “I believe what
        you’re searching for is the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.” Bro. Kuhn I wonder, if you wouldn’t just
        get up and just say a word and this other brother.
         (Bro. Kuhn speaks. Bro. Taylor speaks.)
        
         Jesus, said, “Blessed are the pure in heart.”
        Matthew 5:8-Reference quote
        8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
        And, the only way you can be pure in heart is to be honest with God. That’s the only way we can
        ever receive God’s Promise of the Hour, and God’s great Gift is to be honest in our heart and to
        hunger and to thirst after Righteousness.
        Matthew 5:6-Reference quote:
        6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
         As, I was talking to Bro. Kuhn, and Bro. Richard today, I said, “The very evident fact that out
        of your own mouth, you’re saying just what Jesus Christ said you would say.” He said, the
        Elected would hunger and thirst after Righteousness. So, He answered them and said, “You that
        hunger and thirst after Righteousness, and we know Jesus Christs’ Baptism of the Holy Ghost is
        Righteousness, Christ is Righteousness, ye shall be filled.” And, if you’re hungering and
        thirsting you gotta be filled.
        Matthew 5:6-Reference quote:
        6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
         And, then if you hear the Truth, and you say, “Yes, preacher, I am, I’m poor in Spirit, you
        told me the Truth.” Then Jesus said, “Blessed are you, when you realize you’re poor in Spirit.”
        He said, “Blessed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the filling of the Spirit.” Until you’re willing
        to realize that you are poor in Spirit, then you can’t get filled with the Spirit.
        Matthew 5:3-Reference quote:
        3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
        Matthew 5:6-Reference quote:
        6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
        
        11
         As, I said, of course, these things are all new to Bro. Richard and Bro. Kuhn, so I know
        you’ve heard them time and again, but, maybe do you good to hear them again. Because we said
        many times there was a prophet one time and God appeared to him and said, when he was
        interceding for the little widow.
         The little widow’s husband had died and she had a lot of debts. And, God told the prophet, go
        tell her to go out and find empty vessels. Get all the empty vessels you can. And, then, I’m going
        to fill them with oil. And, I was preaching along one night, and, the Holy Spirit kind of brought
        that to my attention. I said, “Seemingly like the Lord has called me to find empty vessels.” And,
        I said, “Seemingly, that’s a hard thing to do, because everybody that’s following this Message,
        their vessels are already filled with oil.” And, I said, “You can’t fill a vessel that’s filled with oil,
        you’ve got to find an empty one.” Is that right? But, when you can realize that you’re really
        empty, and you don’t really have the great filling of the Holy Ghost, why then you’re willing to
        realize you’re empty. Then God said, “Blessed are you.”
         Now, what we have in America is, that we have a people that has heard a great prophet, and
        everybody can read the books, and listen to tapes. So, everybody is walking around, and they’re
        kind of a little tape dictionary in themselves. They pride themselves in being able to quote Bro.
        Branham. Because Bro. Branham made The Word of God so free, and it’s on tapes, and you can
        set and listen to tapes, and you can just go out and handle any denominational preacher real easy
        with what you’ve learned. So, it makes everybody a kind of, you know, a little walking tape
        dictionary, and we pride ourselves being so spiritual. And, if you don’t watch out, that can be a
        great snare to you though.
         You might be able to come to a place where you can quote everything on tape, but it would be
        better, if you just had a Revelation, a little revelation of what’s on one tape. And, then have an
        attitude towards God that’s right, and come to God, we can’t come to God in this hour. God
        knows how much of the Spirit you have. God knows what you are and how far you are. When
        we get to thinking, that we, just like old Laodicea, a spirit of Laodicea, you know. Jesus said,
        “Thou sayest, thou sayest, that you’re rich in the Spirit,” thou sayest, “That ye have need of
        nothing.” But, I say, “But, I say, “You say that you got the Spirit.” You say,
        “That you don’t have need of nothing.” But, I say, “That thou are wretched, thou art miserable,
        thou art poor, thou art blind, and thou art naked.” Said, I counsel of thee, to buy of Me, gold tried
        in the fire, but said you wouldn’t do it.
        Revelation 3:17-18-Reference quote:
        17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and
        knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
        18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment,
        that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine
        eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
         And so, we find out that the real Endtime Bride of Christ, she gets a Revelation that she’s
        poor in Spirit. She gets a Revelation upon the New Birth, the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and she
        begins to prepare herself, and goes out for the great filling of her vessel.

        489 It goes right by them, and they don’t recognize it till it’s gone. It only picks up the
        predestinated Seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the earth. The same thing
        come through in the days of Noah, same thing come through in the days of Moses, days of
        Elijah, days of the prophets, days of Jesus, on down through and to this very hour. The
        pregnated person with the Seed of God, the Word in there manifesting Itself, so surrendered to
        the will of God that the Word, and the Word alone, manifests Itself in this person, the
        prisoner, to an individual. 490 Not say, “My church…” Now, “my church” has nothing to do
        with it. 491 It’s an individual, one person! All hell is against this Teaching. All hell is against
        this Truth, but it is the Truth. 492 Jesus never said, “Now, Peter, you and John, and all the rest
        the people, YOU’VE GOT THE REVELATION, NOW THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SAVED.”
        No. 493 It was to him, personally. “I say unto thee, thee,” not to them, “to thee, thou art Peter;
        upon this rock I’ll build My Church.” And the word Peter, means “a stone.” Stone means “the
        confessed one,” or, “the separated one.” 494 Upon a certain stone, upon a certain thing; see, a
        called-out, the Church called out; upon this stone, upon this “revelation.” “Flesh and blood
        never revealed it to you. But upon this revelation, called-out group, I’ll build My Church in
        them. And all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it.” 495 “Not one hair of your
        head shall perish. You are Mine! I’ll raise you up in the last day, give unto him Eternal Life,
        and raise him up at the last days.” There it is, the revelation. Not them; but “him,” an
        individual! Not a group; an individual! All hell is against it. 496 BUT HIS MYSTERY IS
        ONLY REVEALED TO HIS BELOVED BRIDE. THAT’S THE ONLY ONE COULD SEE
        IT.
        
         And, this is what causes the great persecution among the mixed multitude that is following
        Bro. Branham’s Message. Because they say, “Well, I just come in to the Message.” I had some
        people down in Louisiana one night. I was preaching in a house meeting, and afterwards they
        were talking. And, they was all excited about these brethren that had come to the Message. But,
        of course, I wasn’t getting my point over down there at all. It just wasn’t going over, you know. I
        said, “Which Message?” and, so they all looked startled, and I said, “Which Message?” I said, “I
        was with Bro. Branham a few months ago in Tucson, and he told Bro. Pearry Green, that there
        was nine different interpretations of his Message in one city.” I said, “Which one of those nine
        did he come to?” and, now after coming here to Louisiana, I know personally, that there must be
        about fifteen or twenty here.” I said, “Which Message?” And, then you go up around
        Jeffersonville, you’ll find several more interpretations to the Message. And, the further you go,
        the more you’ll find.
         Until, there’s hundreds and hundreds of interpretations of the Message. Which one of those
        Messages did they come to? Many interpretations of one prophet’s Message, but only one of
        them is right! Which one of them is right? And, that is the Only One that will produce Life. It’s
        the only One will produce Life! So, the Bride, the real true elected Bride is going to hunger, is
        going to thirst, and once they come in contact with The Truth, then they are going to confess that
        they don’t have It, and that they’re poor in Spirit, and then they go out, and get the Promise of
        God!

        100 You can't be desperate till God speaks to you. Oh, Church, rise and shake yourself! Pinch
        your conscience, wake yourself up, in this hour! We must be desperate, or perish! There is
        coming forth something from the Lord! I know it as THUS SAITH THE LORD. There is
        coming forth something, and we better get desperate. IT'S BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.
        It'll pass through us and we won't see it.
         And, I believe with all my heart when she winds up, she will be that way. She’ll be just that
        way. First, we got to recognize that, like little Bro. Richard said tonight, we can go on, but, see it
        don’t even make sense. Here we have a great prophet’s Message, and then here we find people
        come into the Message, all over the country, and we’re supposed to be rooted and grounded in
        truth. And, here comes a person right straight out of the world, and they come right in, hear the
        Message, and then they say, “What about the Baptism of the Holy Ghost?” Do you believe
        everything that Bro. Branham said? Do you believe he’s a prophet? Naturally, they say, “Yes!”
        Do you believe that everything he says is infallible? Do you believe that every bit, everything
        that’s on tape, you believe it all? “Yes! Yes, yes!” You got IT! That poor soul is not even

        63-0901M - Token
        William Marrion Branham
        201 Apply It, church! Now don’t fail. Will you now? Don’t, don’t, don’t let the sun set. Don’t,
        don’t, don’t, don’t rest, day or night. Don’t take no chance. It won’t work, children. It won’t
        work. You must have the Token! 202 YOU SAY, “I BELIEVE. YES, I GO. I, YEAH, I
        BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. I…” THAT’S ALL RIGHT, BUT, THAT—THAT’S GOOD. 203
        BUT YOU MUST HAVE THE TOKEN! Do you hear, Branham Tabernacle? You must have
        the Token displayed! Without It, all your believing is in vain. See? You’ll live a good life; you
        listen to what the Word says; you go to church; you try to live right; that’s fine, but that’s not It.
        “When I see the Blood,” that’s the Token. And the Token here is not… 204 Cause, what, He—
        He had to see the actual chemistry, because the life had gone, he…had gone from it, it was an
        animal. 205 But here It’s His Own Life that was in the Blood. And the chemistry was only a
        signal or a sign of sanctification, but the Life Itself is the Token; for without the circumcision,
        without the Token, you’re not even in the covenant. The whole thing works together. IF YOU
        SAY YOU’RE CIRCUMCISED TO THE WORD, AND IT ONLY, THEN YOU’LL BELIEVE
        THE WORD; IF YOU BELIEVE THE WORD, THEN THE TOKEN HAS GOT TO COME,
        for he said, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the
        remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” There you are. Oh, my!
        
        14
         And, here, they bring them right through justification, sanctify them and fill them with the
        Holy Ghost, and put them in the running for the Rapture right there. To me, I think that’s a
        terrible thing. What happened, what happened to the rest of the Word of God? What happened to
        the rest of the Word of God? Then, I think, that’s what’s happening all over the country today,
        “If you believe it, you got It.” But, it’s another thing to take what you say that you got and try to
        make it fit the Word of God. And, I’ll say this, no matter how well you may quote tapes, but, if
        you can’t take what Bro. Branham said on tape and place it back in the Word of God, friend, I
        tell you, the devil will sure pour it on you.
         You got to be able to take what you believe and place it in the Word of God. And, like I was
        talking to the little Mennonite brothers out there, what they taught, and, I said, “Well, that sounds
        good, brother dear, but, if you can put that in the Word of God for me.” See?
         “If you can show me in the Word of God, but you can’t.” I can show you many places in the
        Word of God where you’re an unbeliever. And you say, like, he thought I was trying to say he
        wasn’t saved. I said, well, of course in my preaching I do say that. I said, “Now, brother dear, if I
        believed that you had It, I wouldn’t preach to you.” And, I’d come down and be with your group,
        if I believed you had it. I said, “Now somebody is wrong”, and I said, “No use talking about
        these other things,” I said, “You’ve done admitted that you can’t even talk with me on Acts 2:38,
        so what’s the use going any further?”
        Acts 2:38-Reference quote:
        38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
        Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
         Let’s talk about this, let’s take you down and baptize you in the Name of the Lord Jesus, then
        we’ll talk about these other things. He said, “Well, I can’t even talk about it.” So, I said, “Well,
        you see, you proved right there you’re an unbeliever.” And, I said, “No matter, you can say that
        you are Born Again, but, are you Born Again? You say that you’re a Christian, then are you a
        Christian? Anybody can use psychology, that’s psychology.
         Why, Bro. Branham even said, “Jains and Hindus, and the Mohammedans can produce more
        psychology than Christianity,” and their psychology produces a better life than the psychology of
        the United States Christians. But, it’s not psychology at all, it’s a Divine Revelation down in
        your heart. See? You’ve got to have a Divine Revelation down in your heart.
         As long as you believe on Christ as your personal Savior up in your head, I’d say, maybe, I
        don’t know for sure, but, maybe, that might save you at the White Throne Judgement, by just
        accepting Christ. That’s a good start, go ahead and accept what you believe Christ to be, but, if
        your name is on the Lamb’s Book of Life, He will lead you to the Truth.
         But, while, if you just accept Christ in your mind, if you ever come up against a man that’s
        got Revealed Truth, and he pins you down in the Word of God, your intellectual faith is made
        void then, and you’re gone then, and you’re lost. Then your ignorance becomes apostasy then,
        you know. Sure, I believe that there’s people all over the country that’s following Bro. Branham,
        I don’t know how many, that right now may be disbelieving. They’ve got rumors of what is
        being taught up here. Of course, they say things about that I preach, that really, it’s true what
        they say, the doctrine I preach. Like they say, well, “Bro. Lambert don’t believe anybody has the
        Holy Ghost.”

        61-1112 - A True Sign That's Overlooked
        William Marrion Branham
        199 Watch of these meetings, these great evangelists, and even in my humble little ministry, not
        excluding me. Sometimes I feel like ashamed, going out. That’s right. What are we to do? Stand
        and make altar calls and persuade them. Little girls come up there, and all chewing chewinggum, say, “See? See? I’m going. Uh-huh.” These women come up there, with bobbed hair and
        painted faces, Pentecostals, and go in, and come out, and say they spoke in tongues. And never
        let their hair grow, and still do the same thing they did. You tell me that’s conversion? That’s a
        mockery of God. Bible said, “It’s a sin and a disgrace for them to cut their hair.” How can a
        woman with bobbed hair condemn a woman that’s got paint on her face? Might as well hear it.
        The hour is coming, till the axe is laid to the root of the tree. And every tree that bringeth forth
        not good fruit is hewed down. 200 What’s the matter? It was wrong. Cause, our modern, socalled preachers out here, big crowd and stuffed shirts. Organizations know no more about God
        than a Hottentot does about Egyptian night, when it comes. They go up there… 201 What if that
        people at Pentecost would have went up there and said, “Now, Jesus commanded us that we
        should go up here and stay till we receive power from on High. Now, brethren, we’ve been here
        nine days, already. Let us accept it, by faith. Now, we have the Holy Ghost. We go out, because
        we’ve been here. We done what Jesus told us to do”? There had never been no experience. 202
        Let me tell you something. I know this is on tape, but here it comes, anyhow. Listen. I’m going to
        tell you something. It’s a shame. People trying to…I’ve never believed that the Holy Ghost was
        “shaking.” I’ve never believed that the Holy Ghost was “evidence of speaking in tongues, or
        crying, or shouting.” Them is emotional sensations. I believe the Holy Ghost can do that. BUT
        THE HOLY GHOST IS TABERNACLING DEITY. I BELIEVE A GREAT BUNCH OF
        PEOPLE THAT CLAIM TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST DON’T KNOW ONE THING
        ABOUT IT. You meet God. How? The Day of Pentecost! 203 They said now, like the Baptists
        today, the Presbyterian and Methodists. I ask, “Do you believe you got the…” 204 “Oh, yes, we
        accept It, by faith.” By faith, nothing! That isn’t It. It’s a sensation. 205 You like to see a sunset.
        You stand and watch the sun go down, and cry, and tears run down. That ain’t God. That’s
        emotion, from something that’s in you. You hear of somebody being sick, or someone dying, you
        scream out and cry. That’s not God. That’s human emotion. How God… 206 I’ve seen people at
        a ball game, get so happy they’d stammer their lips, everything else. Don’t tell me. WE’RE IN A
        NEED OF REVIVAL, A SALVATION. And the Pentecostals come around, get the people
        worked up, and tell them, “When they speak in tongues, they got the Holy Ghost.” And some of
        them live all kinds of lives, afterwards. Listen, brother. At the Day of Pentecost, it wasn’t so.
        They never relied upon any tongues or anything. While they were there, standing in one place,
        in one accord, God came down, literally, among them. They saw, on each one of them, licks of
        Fire, about like that, hanging above their head. God was there. It was no, “Accept it by faith,
        or some emotion.” They were filled with the Holy Ghost, and then went out and begin to speak
        with tongues. But, first, they met God. THAT’S WHAT’S THE MATTER TODAY. PEOPLE
        GET WORKED UP AND EXCITED, EMOTION, AND IT’S NOT THE HOLY GHOST. THE
        HOLY GHOST IS TABERNACLING DEITY. Your words is His Words. Tell you, what we
        need today, is a call.
        
        16
         Well, you could really cause a lot of trouble by people just saying, that I don’t believe
        anybody’s got the Holy Ghost, on the other hand, that may be true, that may be true. But I think
        people ought to be honest hearted like these brothers are, and come, at least, there’s one thing
        about it, if what you’ve got won’t hold up to the Revelation of God, it ain’t worth holding on to.
        So, if you’re honest hearted, you can’t get hurt any way you go. See? If you’re searching for
        Truth, you’ll ultimately find Truth in the end.
         See? Because Jesus said, “If you hunger and thirst after It, you’re gonna find It!”
         But, your intellectual faith, that’s fine, and, Bro. Branham said in 1965, that’s all the people
        had that was following his Ministry. He said, “We’ve got a Message that’s come from God, but
        I’m afraid that it’s intellectual.” It’s all intellectual. That means it’s all up in the head, and not
        down in the heart.

        58-1221E - The Unity Of One God In The One Church
        William Marrion Branham
        53 You see, Satan uses a man’s head. He chose that in the garden of Eden, to take a man’s
        head, his thinking. And he has brought that down even to the church. See, the devil takes a
        man’s head, so he can use his eye. And if you’ll notice, if the man isn’t genuinely born again,
        spiritual, he’ll take what he can see with his eyes, the pride of life. And he’ll go, many man, to
        say he’s going to—to achieve something, he wants to join church. He wants to be religious. And
        he’ll look around till he can find the biggest church he can find, because man wants to do
        something big. He wants to make a big name for himself. That’s what carnal, foolish-thinking
        man think, “Oh, if I can have my organization! If I can only add so-many thousands to my
        denomination, it’ll be the largest then in the land, of its kind!” What good does that do? But he
        thinks he’s achieving something because he’s adding more. 54 I believe it was some years ago,
        in 1944, that the Baptists had a slogan out, “A million more in ’44.” And what did they have
        when they got a million more? Just like joining a lodge, if they wasn’t genuine, born-again
        disciples of Christ. They were just Baptist by name. 55 Look at the other denominations, the
        Lutheran, the Presbyterian, the Pentecostals, all the other denominations, they’re the same.
        They’re trying to achieve something. They want to do something great, see, because it’s his eye
        he’s looking at. He thinks with his eye. And many times he don’t understand that that’s the thing
        that he oughtn’t to do. But, the devil takes the man’s eye, he shows him something pretty. He
        opens his eyes to look at it. And he’s got that into the church, into the intellectual thinking of
        man. 56 Sometime ago, this great evangelist, Billy Graham, stood here in Louisville, and held up
        his Bible. He said, “This is God’s standard.” And he’s right. He’s exactly right. Mordecai Ham,
        the evangelist, (my old Kentucky home), and I, were sitting at the same table; which, Billy was
        converted under Mordecai Ham. And we were sitting there. And he said, “What happens?” He
        said, “Paul went into a city and got one convert, he returned a year later and he had thirty by
        that one.” Said, “I go into a city and have twenty thousand converts, return in a year and can’t
        find twenty. Something is wrong.” And he said, “You know what it is? It’s you lazy preachers
        that set in the buildings, your offices, with your feet on the desk, and don’t go visit the people.”
        57 I thought, “Billy, that’s a very good intellectual,” please don’t quote me, “but that isn’t it.”
        Who was the pastors that went to that one that Paul got converted? 58 It wasn’t that. It’s here.
        
        17
        Those so-called meetings today, and they are great meetings, but it only works on the
        intellectual part of man. A man gets under the spell of a revival, and he says, “Yes, I accept
        Christ,” and he does it intellectually because he’s in a great crowd. He does it because there’s
        great ministers before him, but it’s only an intellectual conception. That man can never go on.
        HE’S GOT TO COME FROM HIS MIND, TO HIS HEART, AND BE BORN AGAIN, OR
        HE’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO STAND THE TEST. 59 Intellectual conception is all right, but
        when…Remember, when the eye looks upon it, the devil uses your eye. In the garden of Eden, it
        proved that the devil chose the head of man, to work in, but God chooses his heart. The devil
        shows him, with his eyes, something that he can see, and he says, “Seeing is believing.” 60
        BUT WHEN GOD COMES TO A MAN, HE COMES TO HIS HEART. AND HE LETS HIM
        BELIEVE THINGS BY HIS HEART, THROUGH FAITH, THAT HIS EYES DOES NOT
        SEE. FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, THAT, “THE FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE OF
        THINGS HOPED FOR, THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS NOT SEEN.” 61 God working here;
        Satan working here. So what good does these big schools and seminaries do anyhow? It
        sometimes, not always, but too many times, it pulls from here, up to here; when it ought to be
        taken from here, down to here in the man’s heart. 62 You know, the Scripture says, “As a man
        thinketh in his heart, so is he.”

        May they realize, that these great mile posts that we’re passing, these signs a flashing on
        both sides of the road, it’s only the pointing of the soon appearing of the righteous One,
        the Lord Jesus; Who, to be a friend of, means Life; to know, is Eternal Life. And we can only
        know Him according to the Bible, not by our church; but, BY THE BIRTH, THE NEW
        BIRTH, BEING BORN AGAIN.
         And, incidentally, I thought maybe I’d take this time, and, I’d like, before I do. I wasn’t going
        to say anything, but I thought I’d bring my book. You know, Paul carried parchments, well, I’ve
        got some, too. This is just one of them. And, if you ever want to see, you know, I understand
        what Bro. Branham said. Now, it’s not that the people are of the devil, but, see, I know, I know
        that if you’ve got unbelief, you’ve got an evil spirit working around you. And, you don’t know it,
        but the man of God knows it. And, it’s really remarkable to see people, I’ve had them in my
        study and around places, and I know they won’t believe what I say, I can just quote and quote
        Bible and everything, and they’ve got their mind shut up to anything I say, but, I said, “Could I
        quote you something the prophet said?” Then they’ll say, “Oh, yes, yes” because they
         know they’ve got to listen to that see! They know they got to listen to what the prophet said.
        You know, people today are not deceived in William Branham being a prophet, they’re not
        deceived. They all know that he’s a prophet, but what they’re deceived with is the Message that
        the prophet brought. They’re deceived on the Message that he brought. And, they won’t listen to
        what I say, cause they’ve done made up their mind that I couldn’t know anything, so, how could
        I say anything?
         If a person has got their mind already made up, that I’m a false anointed one. As Bro. Gatlin
        said, “Oh, yes, you got your little glass and you’ve zeroed it in, “Oh, yes, he’s a false anointed
        one all right.” That’s, I go and preach in places, and they flip out their glass, you know and they
        get it out, and turn it down, “Aha, aha, yes, I see, he certainly is what everybody said he was.”
        And, I had about 99% of the congregation down in a certain place in the South, and they got
        letters – “Oh, Bro. Lambert’s a false prophet, he said things that never come to pass, he sees
        visions and never come to pass, and there was a preacher friend of mine, and I know who it was,
        and I know why he said it.
         And, I notice this preacher at one time really liked me, and I noticed, boy, when I walked in
        there, it was like the garbage can on the city dump just come open. And, I just set there, I didn’t
        say much, and I just kept looking at him, nervous, you know, everything just got to fumble, his
        wife fumbling. I just kept smiling, you know, kept smiling, kept setting there, I wasn’t about to
        leave, cause I wanted to see what this is. And, ah, he just wouldn’t look at me in the eye, you
        know, and I just kept looking right at him, you know, he’d look over this way, and I’d look over
        that way, this way, boy he was wishing I’d get up and leave, but I wasn’t going to leave, and I set
        right there. He said, “You know, we use to have good fellowship, Bro. Lambert, when you’d
        come up here.” I said, “Yes sir!” But I never did preach there, I never did want to, and he said,
        “You feel that, don’t you, brother?”
        
        19
         I said, “Oh, yes, yes, I feel that. I felt it when I first come in and, he didn’t want to volunteer
        anything. I said, “You know, brother, sometimes a real hot phone call from a certain, certain
        place, from a certain, certain brother.” And, I got right down to home where it was at. He said,
        “That’s it!” “That’s the truth!” “That’s the truth, oh, there was letters and a phone call, that’s
        right, and there’s letters, and it’s all through the church, Bro. Bob.”
         Well, I said, “Brother,” I said, “if I’m guilty of anything, or got something wrong in my life, I
        said, why it’s just best to find out, if I’m wrong, the only thing, I need to repent, and, I said, if I
        am, I’ll be glad to repent.” I said, “If I’ve done anything wrong, I’ll just get up and repent.” And,
        he said, “Well, brother I want you to preach.” I said, “Brother, you know, you never got me to
        preach here before, I don’t want to preach, I don’t want to preach.” But, I said, “Brother, dear,
        you said, you were hungry for God, and you wanted to know the Truth.” I want to know if you
        really mean it.
         I said, “If you really want the Truth, I said, “what if you don’t have five people left out of
        about the ninety that you’ve got, you still want it? I said, “What if your wife don’t even believe
        it, do you still want it? You still want it?” I said, “Because it may cost you 90% of your
        congregation, and may cost you half of your family.” I said, “You still want it?” He said, “If it
        takes the hide off of my back, I want it.” I said, “All right, I’ll preach for you.” Well, it took the
        hide off his back. And, come to find out, that he wanted the hide back. I laid in the floor weeping
        and crying. He tried to get me up, I said, “I can’t get up now, brother.” He said, “Oh, please,
        Bro. Bob, don’t cry like that.” I said, ‘Brother, I’ve got to stay alone awhile.” And, he said,
        “Please, Bro. Bob, I can’t stand you crying like that.” He didn’t know what I was crying for, I
        just couldn’t get up. He said, “Oh, Bro. Bob, please get up.” I said, “Brother, I’m crying because
        the devil is going to turn you against me.” He said, “Oh, Bro. Bob, he’ll never do it.” I said,
        “Don’t you say that, brother, Don’t you say that, he’ll do it.” It wasn’t two weeks that he done
        what I said.
         The man got up, after God did what He did, and witnessed His great Holy Spirit there and
        poured out right there in his church, and vindicated what I was saying, the Supernatural Presence
        of God come right in his home. He knows it. Got up and screamed and cried, “This is the Truth,
        this is the Truth, This is the Truth.” For one time a man has come by and proved what Bro.
        Branham said, and he can’t tear it up. He said, “I don’t care what anybody says about him, this is
        the Truth.” And, it wasn’t two weeks and he turned against me.
        50 It’s pitiful, brothers and sisters, it’s really pitiful. I wonder before I say something, I wonder
        if Bro. Richard would like to say something. I see him sitting here crying, thanking the Lord,
        thanking the Lord for the Promise, thanking Him for the Truth, and we believe the Lord led
        Richard here. I understand he’s been overseas, going around everywhere trying to find the Truth.
        And God led him down here, and I remember the first time that he came, and the Holy Spirit fell
        upon him, and he was setting back there behind this pole with Bro. Frank, and then he said, “This
        is the first church I was ever in where I felt the Supernatural Presence of Christ.” Isn’t that right,
        brother?” (Amen) And, he said, “I’m coming back here.” And, I told the brethren, I said, “If he
        comes, he’ll sure be hindered.” When you say, you are going to come here, you can look for a
        great hindrance. How many say, “Amen” to that? A great hindrance. So, we’re very thankful that
        the Lord Jesus let Bro. Richard be with us. I feel like he’s part of us, and been here all the time.
        Now, I wonder if Bro. Richard….and, I know he loves the Lord Jesus. And, I love to see people
        that’s in love with the Lord Jesus Christ. He’s been searching for Him all over the country, and I
        understand he’s been over to Hawaii, and all over the place. Bro. Richard, I wonder if you just
        wouldn’t’ stand and give us a little word of testimony.
        
        20
         Bro. Richard testifies.
         You know, I don’t know why people in this day has gotten away from the Supernatural.
        Everything about a child of God is Supernatural, and when he really meets God, there’s
        something about him he craves the Supernatural. How many craves the Supernatural? One
        Supernatural thing that God will do in your life will do more for you than anything else I know
        of, just to know that God works the Supernatural through you. It’s a normal thing for a child of
        God to hunger and thirst after the Supernatural, and did you know that Jesus wants you, do you
        know Jesus wants you to be a miracle worker? He wants every child of God to be a miracle
        worker.
         But what we think about it is, that God has kind of been working so long, that maybe it’d be
        too much trouble for Him to do these things, or maybe He’s just gave out so many things like
        that, that maybe there’s not too much left, maybe we better not believe Him, or ask for very
        much. Bro. Branham said, “It’s like a little mouse under the great granaries of Egypt, saying to
        his friends, “Let’s just eat one grain today, cause we may run out.” I don’t believe we can
        exhaust the goodness and the power of God, do you? How many believe that the Lord Jesus
        wants to get glory from us?

        21 Could you imagine a little fish about that long, out in the middle of the ocean saying, “I better
        drink of this water sparingly; I might run out someday”? Oh, my…that…Why, my…That’s
        nothing compare with what the blessings God’s got for you. Could you imagine a little mouse
        under the great garners of Egypt saying, “I just better eat a few grains each day, because it
        might not last through the winter”? Why, he could never eat it in a thousand lifetimes. Neither
        could you “off-surp” the blessings that God’s got laid up from you if you live ten million years
        here on earth. There’ll still be plenty of blessings for you left, for He is the inexhaustible fountain
        of Life. When you plant yourself in Him, by this fountain, it’s like the tree that’s planted by the
        rivers of water. How glorious. And how He likes to push forth His blessings to His people and
        give to them abundantly.
         I believe that, the apostle once said, “Any preacher that will come, (I added that word
        preacher), he said, spirit, “Any preacher’s spirit that will come and say, “That Jesus Christ has
        not come to be manifested in the flesh, your flesh, he is an anti-Christ.” Don’t you believe him!
         So, any time that you see anybody that even though they claim to believe this Message, and
        will tell you, “That was only for Bro. Branham, that it’s all over, and will place the promises of
        God in this day to a day gone by in Bro. Branham,” or as I, just, a dear brother put out a paper
        against this Revelation here and tried to tear it up on the manifested sons of God.
         Why is people so angry at my teaching on manifested son of God? The Lord revealed to me,
        revealed to me that not too long ago. He showed me that even, uh, well, that even. It’s even
        getting into the dear Bro. Branham’s family. It’s working up a resentment against my teaching of
        the manifestation of a son of God. But I’ll guarantee you, before it’s over, they’ll everyone
        
        21
        believe what a manifested son of God is. And, I find it that some of the ministers now that’s
        rallying against this Revelation, and they’re saying that all these brothers that are expecting great
        power to come upon them to be manifested son of God, “they don’t realize that that’s over in the
        Millennium.” Well, that’s true, I’ll go along with that, over in the Millennium you won’t cut
        down a tree, and you’ll move it, and you’ll do those things over there.
         But I want to tell you something, you’ll be a manifested son of God this side of the
        Millennium, or you won’t be over there. You’ll either be one here, or you won’t be over there.

        429 Now remember, He is that Tree of Life, contrary to “the serpent’s seed,” you see. He’s that
        Seed, “the woman’s Seed,” the Tree of Life in the garden. “And lest they put forth their hands
        and move this Tree, they’d eat that Tree and live forever.” AND HE’S THE ONLY TREE THAT

        He had to be chopped down. And He was put on a tree of disgrace, “cursed is he that hang on a

        TO NOT FALL. SHE WON’T FAIL. SHE IS PREDESTINATED TO IT. “Blessed is the man
        who God will not impute sin.”
         So, it’s easy to tell one side of it, and, I tell you what I desire, And, I don’t say this and God
        knows, I told the brethren here, usually I don’t even talk to people personally. I just let them
        come and hear it, and if they get it fine, but I just talked to them today. I don’t go around the
        country and try to prove anybody wrong. I just preach to my little congregation. Many times,
        even, mother and dad heard one of my tapes down in Pennsylvania and, I know people resent me
        letting tapes out, and, then I decided I won’t do that. And, God knows, God knows that right here
        these brothers come and begged me to let them make my tapes, I wouldn’t even let them record
        my preaching. Is that right?
         I told them you listen to Bro. Branham and if what you think I’m saying, if you believe it’s
        right and you want to believe it, I’ll be your pastor. And I’ve never tried to push anything that I
        believe down anybody’s throat. And, the only reason people here believe what I say, that they
        found it in the Word of God. And, I charged them everyone in the Name of Jesus to search the
        tapes, search the books, and if you can find one time that I ever contradicted the Revelation of
        God, I’ll repent and quit preaching the Gospel.
         And, so, well, they’ve been searching, and I’ve never had anybody say anything to me yet.
        But I don’t go around, I’m not picking at the brothers. They can believe anything; they just don’t
        understand. They don’t understand. But, uh, I don’t think that, you know, that they ought to just
        condemn something before they even hear a man. It’s easy to prove somebody wrong behind
        their back, but it’s a shame, but, the devil has already alerted against this message, and the Lord
        
        23
        has revealed it to me, even in to dear Bro. Branham’s family. It’s worked up a resentment against
        this Revelation, against myself, my family, and what’s it caused by? Of what they hear people
        say. See? That’s why it’s so dangerous, it’s dangerous to listen to tales people tell.
         And, then what it is, no wonder Bro. Branham said, “There’ll be a “fanatic” message, a
        fanatic message, and a fanatic preacher will go forth through the land.” There’ll be a Message
        pass through them and the people will miss it and It’ll be gone and over before they know what’s
        going on.” And, said, “It will be great, just like my ministry, but it will be so humble, it will pass
        right through them.

        37 Now, you see, Jesus had proven to God that He’d been the right kind of Son. And God took
        Him up on the top of the mountain, brought witnesses out there—heavenly witnesses and earthly
        witnesses—and He clothed Him in immortality. When they looked up, they said, “His garments
        shined like the sun.” A supernatural something taken place. His garments glistened like the sun
        in its middle of the day, as white as they could be. God placed on Him that robe of immortality,
        showing that He had received Him. That’s the thing that God will do to His sons here on earth
        someday. He will call you aside, Church, if you’ll only obey Him and stay on the Word and
        believe it. And He will place into the Church, before the coming of Jesus Christ… He will
        place into the Church… All the powers that Christ had in Him will be in the Church. All that
        God was, He poured into Jesus; all that Jesus was, He pours into the Church. God wanting
        His work done, He sent it into His Son; the Son wanting the work done, sent it into the
        Church. “At that day you’ll know that I’m in the Father, the Father in Me, and I in you, and
        you in Me.” At that day, because the same power of God, was in Jehovah God, rested in Jesus
        Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ, rests in the placed sons in the body of
        Christ. 38 Placing of a son… Take him out in a certain place, have a ceremony before Angels,
        and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ. THEN THAT PERSON HAS THE
        AUTHORITY. Let me say this, if you count me a fanatic from this night on. That very same thing
        that I’m speaking of will be done. THERE’LL BE A POWER PUT INTO THE CHURCH,
        AND NOW IS COMING IN, THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL SO ANOINT THE PEOPLE,
        TILL THEY’LL SPEAK THE WORD AND IT’LL CREATE ITSELF RIGHT THERE. WE
        HAVEN’T SEEN POWERS LIKE’S COMING INTO THE CHURCH NOW. I KNOW IT

        FOR A FACT. “Say unto this mountain be moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that
        what you’ve said shall come to pass, you can have what you have said”: THE PLACING OF
        THE CHURCH IN POSITION, WHERE THE FULNESS OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY
        GHOST COMES INTO THE CHURCH. THEN CRITICS’ MOUTHS WILL BE SHUT.

        desires of their heart, they don’t, haven’t had any teaching, and they don’t claim to be a know-itall, and of course, I don’t want to appear that way. Of course, sometimes it may appear that I’m
        just trying to be a know-it-all, but that’s my ministry is preaching. And, if I didn’t believe what I
        was preaching, I just wouldn’t preach you know. So, when I preach it, I just preach like I am

        right and everybody else is wrong. And, I could be wrong, I could be wrong, but I don’t think so.
        I could be, but I don’t think so. I tell you why, because I find it’s all right here (pats the Bible).
        Now, I use to, say, “Now, Lord, I must be wrong,” but I quit saying that see, because I found out
        in the Word of God, what I was saying is right.
         And, so that’s why that I don’t have one speck of doubt. Not one little speck, there’s never
        enters into my mind one speck of doubt that what I’m telling you, that I believe what the apostle
        Paul or Jesus Christ Himself was preaching to this congregation they would be saying the same
        thing that you’ve been hearing. Why? Is because I believe that it’s the Revelation that has come
        forth from the Seals! And, to tell you the truth, I don’t believe Paul knew it. I don’t believe any
        of the prophets knew what you’re hearing right today.
        Luke 10:21-24-Reference scripture:
        21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and

        babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.
        22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the
        Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.
        23 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the
        things that ye see:
        24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see,
        and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

        it’s, “Time is no more.” And He said, “When the Seventh angel has begin to sound, then the
        mystery should be finished, AND TIME FOR THE ANGEL TO APPEAR.” We’re close,
        somewhere. Right. Now notice. 48 The Seven Seals holds the mystery of the Book. Until we can
        see what those Seven Seals has sealed in, we’re only presuming them things. Because, as I’ve
        told you, this morning, upon my little Message this morning, of God hiding in simplicity. You see,
        we—we are…We are sure to miss the thing unless It is absolutely, genuinely revealed by the
        Holy Spirit, and vindicated the same. See? If the prophet rises and tells you that This is just That,
        and God don’t vindicate the same, forget it. See? But God, in every statement, in everything, has
        to vindicate It, to make It right. See? So, His children will watch those things, see, and be alert,
        notice. 49 Seven Seals on the Book, has the…These Seven Seals has the Book sealed. See? The
        Book is absolutely sealed. Do you see it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] The Book is
        absolutely a sealed Book until the Seven Seals is broken. It is sealed up with Seven Seals. Now,
        that’s a different from the Seven Thunders. See? This is Seven Seals on the Book. And the Book
        will not, the Seals will not be released until the Message of the seventh angel. See? So we—we
        are presuming; but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding,
        vindicated Truth. Now, that’s exactly what the Word says, “The mystery should be finished at
        that time.” 50 And this Seven-Seal Book, remember, It was closed here, in Revelation the 5th
        
        30
        chapter, and in Revelation the 10th chapter It is opened. 51 And now we’re going to see what the
        Book says about how It become open. AND IS NOT MADE KNOWN UNTIL THE LAMB
        TAKES THE BOOK, AND BREAKS THE SEALS, AND OPENS THE BOOK. See? THE
        LAMB has got to take the Book. 52 It’s hid. Now remember, “No man in Heaven, no man in
        earth,” pope, bishop, cardinal, state presbyter, or whoever he is, “can break them Seals, or
        reveal the Book, BUT THE LAMB.” And we have probed, and presumed, and stumbled, and
        wondered, and—and that’s the reason we’re all in such a confusion. 53 But with the Divine
        promise that this Book of Redemption will be perfectly OPENED BY THE LAMB, and the
        SEALS THEREOF WILL BE LOOSED BY THE LAMB, in the last days in which we’re
        living now. And is not made known until the LAMB takes the Book and breaks the Seals.
        Because, remember, the Book was being holded in the hands of Him that sat upon the Throne.
        “And the LAMB comes to Him that sits upon the Throne, and takes the Book out of His right
        hand.” Takes the Book! Oh, that’s deep. We’ll try to solve it out if we can, by the help of the
        Holy Spirit. Now we’re depending on Him. And we will see, later, it is at the end time, “When
        time has run out.” 54 No denominations has a right for interpretation of the Book. No man has a
        right to interpret It. IT IS THE LAMB WHO INTERPRETS IT. AND THE LAMB IS THE
        ONE WHO SPEAKS IT, AND THE LAMB MAKES THE WORD TO BE KNOWN, BY
        VINDICATING AND BRINGING THE WORD TO LIFE. See? Exactly

         The Bible said, it was Sealed up with Seven Seals.
        And, Bro. Branham even said himself, and I can watch Bro. Branham as he brought a
        continual… now if you’ll watch a man that is bringing revelation. You know, if you’ll watch a
        man that is preaching by intellectualism, if he’s making tapes, listen to what he preaches tonight,
        and go back next year, and back five years and listen to his tapes, and you’ll find them filled with
        contradictions. But, if you ever find God’s servant that’s preaching by inspiration, in divine
        revelation, you’ll never find a contradiction on no tape. Oh, you’ll find “hain’t, can’t and fetch
        it”, and all kinds of dictionary errors, and vocabulary errors and miss quotes, and things like that,
        but the Revelation will be perfect. And, if it’s not perfect, then it’s not the Holy Spirit revealing
        it.
         So, that’s a challenge to anybody, isn’t it? Search the tapes, search the books, and see whether
        or not these things be so.
        John 5:39-40-Reference quote:
        39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which
        testify of me.
        40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
         Now, let me read here from a tape called: “Countdown.” (62-0909m WMB.) How many
        believe that was inspired of God, “Countdown”? How many believe that what I read on it, will
        be the Lord, you’ll believe it’s the Lord? Now let me quote Bro. Branham. Now this is a good
        one, now this subject that I got here, I titled it: “Baptism of the Holy Ghost in Relation to the
        New Birth.” Now, remember, we’ll make this a little church doctrine here tonight so Bro., now a
        lot of people they don’t want anybody to know everything they believe at first, so maybe they’ll
        come again. Well, I’ll tell you about the way I am about that. If God leads you, you’ll come, and
        if you don’t you won’t.
         And I never was a man that believed in numbers. You know I never did, as long as I’ve ever
        preached, since 1958. I never did hang one of them little things on the wall, you know, that said,
        in Sunday School last Sunday and ten dollar offering. I used to go in them things, and I said,
        man, why don’t that preacher get that thing off the wall, I just never did like that, and I never did
        have it, cause I always felt, what business is it of mine, for me to say, “I only got ten, oh boy,
        I’ve got to get 20 people in here.” What business is that of mine? I always felt that God called
        me, this is the way I always took it, and I used to have some old holes in the wall where I
        preached in old buildings, you know, maybe four or five would come, but that’s all God wanted
        to come. And, I thought, now, Lord, if that was You that appeared to me there, and You called
        me to be Your servant, and if I just preach this, then You’re under obligation to send to me Your
        sheep. And, if I’m telling the Truth, and if I love Your sheep, then You said, “You’d send them
        to me.” Now, I’ll just go on until You send me Your sheep. And, you know, that’s what I’ve
        done. That’s what I’ve done, and I think, to me, they say, well why don’t get a radio program,
        well, I wouldn’t want no radio program. Say, well, why don’t you get a paper and put it out? No,
        I wouldn’t do that, I’d just rather wait around and let God do it.
        
        32
         There’s just something about it, I’d just like to see God do the thing, See? That’s why I just
        try to hide it up here, and just wait for the Lord to do it. See, it’s not hard for the Lord, I believe
        the Lord can do something tonight and the ears and the telephones would be buzzing before
        daylight.
         You know, one day they’ll call and say, “I hear something happened up there, what’s going
        on?” “Oh, nothing much, just healing the sick and casting out devils, and everybody getting
        filled with the Holy Ghost.” That’s right, well it ought to, we’ve been preaching it long enough.
        How many would like to answer a phone call like that? (Amen!)
         Now, let’s read here from “Countdown” (62-0909m WMB.) on the subject of the Baptism of
        the Holy Ghost. This is our church doctrine here. I’d say, that across the country and around the
        world people that’s following Bro. Branham, this is the most hated revelations, that’s been
        preached, that’s preached here, is one of the most hated things, and why we’re so bitterly
        persecuted. But I’d hate to be on the opposing side, to try to find Scriptures to disprove what I’m
        ready to say, firmly, solidly believe that the New Birth and the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is two
        different things. I believe that you cannot receive the true Baptism of the Holy Ghost, unless first
        you are born again. How many here in this church believe that? Now, let me read, quote Bro.
        Branham on “Countdown” preached in Jeffersonville (62-0909m WMB.) Of, course, please, let’s
        not disqualify this because it was a few months before the Seals were opened. You, know, I’ve
        heard people say, “Oh, is that before the Seals, Bro, Lambert?” I’d say, “Well, yes, but it was
        inspired.” And, Bro. Branham said, “I’ve never took back anything that I preached that was
        inspired.” Now, you know, I don’t know about you, but I believe, he was a prophet before the
        Seals were opened. How many believe the prophet before the Seals were opened? (Amen!)
         You know, we love him so much, they say, but when they quote a tape and it begins to tear up
        their little interpretation before the Seals were opened, sometimes they doubt whether or not he
        was a prophet.
         Quote Bro. Branham (62-0909mWMB.) “If a man just trusts on justification, he’s wrong, and
        if the Pentecostals say, “Repent and get the Holy Ghost”, that’s wrong. Because you have got to
        get sanctification to get cleansed, if you don’t the Holy Ghost won’t come in you, if you leave
        out the Blood. People talk and say, that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is the New Birth, and that
        is wrong.” Unquote! Would you like for me to read it again? People talk and say, that the
        Baptism of the Holy Ghost is the New Birth, and that is wrong. The New Birth is when you are
        born again, but the Holy Ghost is when power comes into the New Birth.” THE NEW
        BIRTH IS FAITH in Christ.” Unquote:
        Endnote:
        62-0909M - Countdown
        William Marrion Branham
        37 So if a man sets on the thought of “just justification is all you have to have,” he’s wrong,
        wrong. He’s got to be wrong. And then if the church who believes like the many of the
        Pentecostals, that the Holy Ghost is it, “that’s all, just repent and get the Holy Ghost,” that’s
        still wrong, because you’ve got to get sanctification in there to cleanse it before the Holy Ghost
        comes in. If you don’t, you leave out the Blood. See? And the new Birth, as people talks that the
        baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new Birth. Now, that’s wrong. THE BAPTISM OF THE
        HOLY GHOST IS DIFFERENT FROM THE NEW BIRTH. The new Birth is when you’re
        
        33
        born again. BUT THE HOLY GHOST IS WHEN POWER COMES INTO THAT BIRTH
        FOR SERVICE. That’s exact. See? The Holy Ghost is…baptized into the Holy Ghost. 38 THE
        NEW BIRTH, YOU HAVE THE NEW BIRTH BY BEING BELIEVING ON THE LORD
        JESUS CHRIST. SEE? BY HAVING FAITH AND ACCEPTING HIM AS YOUR SAVIOUR,
        THAT’S BIRTH, SEE, BECAUSE YOU’VE PASSED FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE. Now, if
        you want to back that up, take Saint John 5:24, “He that heareth My Words and believeth on
        Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.” See, he’s got Life because he believes. And that same
        group had to go to Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Exact. 39 HOLY GHOST IS
        POWER FOR SERVICE. So when talk about you got to be born again, and applying that to the
        Holy Ghost, many of the Methodists and so forth are wrong there. It cannot. It just won’t cope
        through the Scripture here. You get the thing sideways. It’s got to take it the way the Scripture’s
        got it placed out here. See? And the Holy Spirit is a…“You shall receive the new Birth after
        this”? What? No. “YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER,” ACTS 1:8, “AFTER THIS THE
        HOLY GHOST IS COME UPON YOU.” See? And they had already believed to Eternal Life,
        and so forth, but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power. “YOU SHALL BE WITNESSES
        UNTO ME AFTER THE HOLY GHOST IS COME UPON YOU,” BECAUSE THE HOLY
        GHOST IS A WITNESS OF THE RESURRECTION, showing that you have become an adult
        in Christ.

         “The prophet said, “That the New Birth is Faith in Christ.” That’s the New Birth, and the
        Baptism of the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God, the Capstone, Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now,
        Bro. Kuhn and them, our dear brother here, has been taught that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is
        Faith. So, then we’ve got to turn the pyramid upside down and Baptism comes down here.
        Where does Faith come in? You’ve got the pyramid turned upside down. You’ve got the Baptism
        of the Holy Ghost, and then you get the New Birth, huh? Where does the New Birth come, up
        here? Somebody tell me where it’s at? Or add, to your Baptism of the Holy Ghost Virtue, add to
        the fullness of Christ in you, the Hope of Glory, add to that Virtue, and after you’ve got Christ in
        you, add Knowledge. See how ridiculous it is? Add Temperance, add Patience, add Godliness,
        add Brotherly Kindness, and then after you get that, who knows what that is up here, I don’t
        know what they call that! Amen, elder, that’s right.
         “The New Birth is Faith,” Quote Bro. Branham now: “The New Birth is Faith in Christ,
        believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, having passed from death unto life,” St. John 5:24.

         This same group after believing on the Christ had to go to Pentecost to get filled with the
        Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is Power for Service, must take it the way it is written. After your
        New Birth, then ye shall receive Power. Acts 1:8 “Ye shall receive Power, ye shall be witnesses
        of the Resurrection, shows you have become an adult in Christ.” Unquote.
        Acts 1:8-Reference quote:

        part of the earth.
         So, what is it? Bro. Branham, if you want to know what the New Birth meant, then the New
        Birth is a Divine Revelation of the Promised Word of God, Christ. You know, Christ is the
        Bridegroom. So, the Revelation of God upon the Bridegroom, the Revealed Word of God is the
        New Birth!

        230 And now the Christ in the Church is just being made known. THE WHOLE THING IS
        THE REVELATION OF GOD, TO TAKE EVE BACK TO HER RIGHT POSITION AGAIN
        WITH HER HUSBAND. Notice, and God is the Husband of the Church, and the Church is His
        Bride. 231 Now, Peter, when he called, said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
        232 Now watch. “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona,” says, which means, “son of Jona.” See?
        “Blessed art thou, for flesh and blood never revealed This to you. You never learned It from
        some school. But My Father which is in Heaven has revealed It to you.” Notice what He said to
        him, “Upon this rock…” That’s Peter, the predestinated Seed of God that had received this
        Light, and given the keys to the Kingdom. “UPON THIS ROCK OF REVELATION OF WHO
        JESUS CHRIST IS,” HE IS THE FULL, MANIFESTED GOD. “UPON THIS ROCK…” Not
        
        35
        a Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and Him being the second Person. “Upon this rock I’ll build
        My Church, and the gates of hell will never shake It down, never prevail against It.” See?
        “I’LL BUILD MY CHURCH UPON THIS ROCK,” A REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST.
        233 LOOK, CHRIST IN YOU MAKES HIM THE CENTER OF LIFE OF THE
        REVELATION. SEE? CHRIST’S LIFE IN YOU MAKES HIM THE CENTER OF THE
        REVELATION. CHRIST, IN THE BIBLE, MAKES THE BIBLE THE COMPLETE
        REVELATION OF CHRIST. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole
        thing, see, what God is trying to do. 234 WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH THEN? YOU’D SAY,
        “WELL, BROTHER BRANHAM, WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH?” IT IS THE
        REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST PERSONALLY TO YOU. Amen! See? Not you joined a
        church, you shook a hand, you done something different, you said a creed, you promised to live
        by a—a code of rules. BUT CHRIST, THE BIBLE, HE IS THE WORD THAT WAS
        REVEALED TO You. And no matter what anybody says, what takes place, it’s Christ; pastor,
        priest, whatever it might be. It’s Christ in you, that is the revelation that the Church was built
        upon. 235 You say, “Well, I’m a Lutheran. I’m a Baptist. I’m Presbyterian.” That don’t mean
        one, don’t mean [Brother Branham snaps his finger—Ed.] that to God, not a thing, not a snap of
        your finger. 236 What is it? It’s Christ being revealed, and He is the Word. And when the
        Word is revealed, It expresses Itself. See? That’s God’s purpose for Jesus Christ, was to express
        Himself, to take His Own laws and live by His laws, con-…and fulfill His law, by death. AND
        CHRIST, GOD, DIED IN FLESH, IN ORDER TO CONDEMN SIN IN THE FLESH, THAT
        HE MIGHT BRING TO HIMSELF A GLORIOUS BRIDE, REDEEMED BACK, THAT
        WILL BELIEVE ONLY IN THE WORD OF GOD; and not swap It, like Eve did, for
        intellectual conceptions of man. You see it? That’s Christ’s idea. That’s God’s idea. THE NEW
        BIRTH REVEALS THIS. 237 And if a man says he is born again, and try to place these
        promises of Christ, in this last days, to some other age, making Him Christ yesterday but not
        today, then that man or that person has been in a—a delusion by Satan. And if that man says that
        he believes That, and it doesn’t manifest itself through him? 238 Jesus said, in Mark 16, “These
        signs shall follow them that believe; into all the world, and to every age.” Casting out devils,
        and speaking with tongues, and—and all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow,
        that, “they shall!” Not, “they may be; they ought to.” “They will!” And heavens and earth will
        pass away, but His Word won’t. 239 So it’s Christ expressing Himself in the individual,
        whether he’s intellectual or whether he’s—he don’t know his ABC’s. Half the apostles didn’t
        know it, that’s right, but they knowed Christ. They never taken heed to Peter and John, knowing
        that they had been out of some seminary. They said, “They taken heed and noticed that they had
        been with Christ,” when they healed the lame man, see, at the gate. They knowed they—they had
        been with Christ. 240 THE NEW BIRTH IS CHRIST, IS A REVELATION. GOD HAS
        REVEALED TO YOU THIS GREAT MYSTERY, AND THAT’S A NEW BIRTH. Now what
        are you going to do when you get all that group together, where the revelation is perfectly in
        harmony, and God expressing it through His Word by the same actions, the same things that He
        did, making the Word manifest! OH, IF THE CHURCH ONLY KNEW ITS POSITION! IT
        WILL, ONE DAY. Then, the Rapture will go when it knows what it is. Now notice. 241 You say,
        “Brother Branham, but that—that ain’t…” Oh, yes, it is, too. It is the Truth. 242 Did you notice?
        Paul never knew Jesus, physically. Paul never knew Him. THE ONLY WAY THAT PAUL
        KNEW HIM WAS BY A REVELATION, by a vision. Is that right? [Congregation says,
        “Amen.”—Ed.] Paul only knew Jesus by the revelation, just like Peter did. 243 Peter had seen
        Him in flesh, but he didn’t know Him by flesh, ’cause JESUS SAID SO. “FLESH AND BLOOD
        
        36
        DIDN’T REVEAL IT TO YOU. EVEN MY OWN LIFE DIDN’T REVEAL IT TO YOU. BUT
        MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN HAS REVEALED THE THING TO YOU,” THAT
        HE IS THE WORD OF GOD, “AND UPON THIS ROCK I’LL BUILD MY CHURCH.”
        PETER DIDN’T KNOW HIM BY FLESH. Man walked, and handled Him, and everything else.
         You say, “But, I didn’t feel no shiver come down my spine, I didn’t feel nothing. Jesus never
        said, “Did you feel it, did you believe it?” did you believe it,”? See.

         People thinking that the New Birth is an experience, is an experience. The New Birth is NOT
        an experience. The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is your experience. And, it’s an experience of
        Power. What is, did you know, I think I said this before, The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is only
        a temporary gift. And, the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is the Life Power of the Holy Ghost
        coming to make this New Birth live! And Prove what It is.
         That’s what It is, it’s the Power of God coming to make the Word in you live and act out, heal
        the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, prophesy, see visions, speak with tongues. That’s
        what the Baptism is.
         Now, the brethren in the Message says, “That the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is at the bottom
        of the pyramid.” Why do they say that? Because they’re scared to think that they’re on the
        outside of the Body of Christ. And, you’re either in the Body or you’re out of the Body.
        And, if the believers today are already in the Body, then why can’t we prove Mrs. Jesus? Why
        can’t we know where the Bride is? Why can’t we see Apostolic signs and wonders?
         If, this is the Bride, then why, the Bride it says in the Bible what the Bride is gonna be, then
        why can’t you find the Bride, or where is the Body then? So, therefore, they got to say, “This is
        the Baptism.” And, then we add to our Baptism, Virtue. Now, Jesus said, “Ye shall receive
        Power after that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost comes upon you.”

        Him. 308 That’s godliness. When He was smite on one side of the face, He turned the other.

        LOT GOES WITH THAT. Huh? See? There’s a lot goes with That. And here is what I think that
        God is proving: the Holy Spirit is here. See? 94 Now, Peter said, FIRST, “FAITH.” Now watch
        it real close now. We’re going to teach this for a few minutes. FAITH, NOW, IS YOUR FIRST.
        And add to your faith, virtue; to your virtue, knowledge; to your knowledge, temperance; to

        brotherly kindness; and then love. And anyone knows that love is God. “God is love.” See? 95
        Now, that then, from this, and then bringing this into the seven church ages. God is building, in
        seven church ages, a Bride for Christ; through the Philadelphian, Thyatirean, and Pergamos,
        and Smyrnaean, and Ephesus. A church age, that Jesus said, “If the—if the Bridegroom come in
        the first watch or the seventh watch, all these virgins awakened.” They were. They awoke, the
        virgins of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. Did you
        notice that? It was the seventh age, that when He came and woke up those sleeping virgins. That
        brings them all the way back down to here. See? FOR, IN THIS, THROUGH THE YEARS,
        AGES, HE HAS BUILT A BRIDE, BORN A BRIDE, BEGOTTEN A BRIDE ON EARTH
        FOR CHRIST. AND THE SAME WAY THAT HE BEGETS THIS BRIDE, HE HAS BEGOT
        INDIVIDUALS. 96 Now I’m backgrounding this, so that you will see when the sister’s dream is
        being told. 97 NOW, THESE THINGS HERE ABSOLUTELY MUST BE IN THE

        DOWN ON TOP AND MAKES A COMPLETE UNIT.
        
        
         So, here you got Baptism of the Holy Ghost, you got Power for Service, but you don’t have
        no Virtue, you don’t have no Knowledge, you don’t have no Patience. That don’t make sense,
        does it? It says, “Go down into Jerusalem, and tarry there, and you shall receive Power for

        Power shall come for Service. Power comes in to the New Birth, and proves the Life of Christ.
         Look here, Bro. Branham says, “You’ve got to have Life here, to receive that Life that’s
        coming.” If you don’t have this here, there’s no way in the world that can come to you. See?

        won’t cope through the Scripture here. You get the thing sideways. It’s got to take it the way
        the Scripture’s got it placed out here. See? And the Holy Spirit is a…“You shall receive the new
        Birth after this”? What? No. “YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER,” ACTS 1:8, “AFTER THIS
        THE HOLY GHOST IS COME UPON YOU.” See? And they had already believed to Eternal
        Life, and so forth, but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power. “You shall be witnesses unto
        Me after the Holy Ghost is come upon you,” because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the
        resurrection, showing that you have become an adult in Christ.

         Now, what I hear, I would like to be able to put it right in here (Bible), and then I’ll know I’m

        way I put it, fine, you say, that you’re a Christian, well, prove it to me.
         And, if what you say if you got the New Birth, and you won’t come to the Word of God, then
        I don’t believe you’ve got the New Birth. And, if you say that you have the Baptism of the Holy
        Ghost, and if John Dillinger’s spirit is on you, you’d rob banks, and you’d tell me John
        Dillinger’s spirit is on you, but you’re afraid to rob a bank. I wouldn’t believe you. And, if you

        44
        Promise of God, I’ll flat out tell you, you’re NOT Born Again! Because the Bible said, “HE
        THAT IS BORN OF GOD CANNOT DOUBT GOD’S WORD! HE THAT IS BORN OF GOD
        CANNOT SIN,” the Bible says. Why? Because the Seed of God is in him. The Seed of God
        remains in him, and he cannot sin.
         Can you imagine Jesus saying, Jesus was the Word, wasn’t He? Do you believe Jesus was
        Born right? Do you believe Jesus had the Baptism of the Holy Ghost when He was Born?
        (Someone in the audience says, “No!”) You can’t fool these people, can you? You better had
        not said, “yeah!” Jesus was Born right, right? Why was He Born? He was Born of the
        Unadulterated Word of God, is that right? He was Born of the Unadulterated Word of God. And,

        They say, “Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.” That’s right. But we
        made a tradition out of it. They stink before Him. You see the reason? The worshipper coming,
        doing it, he did it only as a form. And we are guilty of doing the same thing. We make a form
        out of it, yet it’s the commandment of God. 35 Like, just recently when our movements got
        started, and God begin to adding something to them, and we went off with it, made a tradition
        out of it, and it lost its power. Instead of bringing brotherhood together, it separated
        brotherhood. You do it sometimes just for a tradition, without the sincerity of it. You’ve got to
        enter the feast of God with sincerity. No real sincerity, no real sorrow for sin… People come up
        to the altar, and many of them take a lot of music, a little dancing, clapping of hands, maybe run
        up and down the aisle, and maybe just speak with tongues. Now, I believe in speaking in tongues.
        I believe in running up and down the aisles; I believe in the clapping of hands. But if there isn’t
        some feeling behind there, if there’s some sincerity that Jesus Christ has cleansed you… Not
        doing it because Miss Jones did it, but doing it because there’s something in you pulsating, the
        sorrow for your sins, and the joy of the victory that you share in the resurrection of your
        sacrifice, the evidence of your eternal security. How can you not be sincere in that? 36 I believe
        a man can shout and not be saved. I believe he can run and not be saved. I believe he can speak
        in tongues and not be saved. I believe he can do any of these things and not be saved. But you
        
        45
        can’t class everybody that does that now. The other side says, “There’s nothing to any of it.”
        BUT THERE’S SOMEBODY SINCERE IN THAT. THERE’S SOMEBODY GOT THE
        GENUINE RESULTS, BECAUSE HE ENTERED IT SINCERELY UPON THE BASIS OF
        HIS FAITH IN THE SHED BLOOD. AND HE GOT THE RIGHT THINGS. But the other
        one’s only mocking. And there’s too much mocking going on, too much impersonation, carnal
        impersonations, carnal comparisons. 37 If you’d come seeking the Holy Spirit, and let Him, the
        faith that you’ve got in Him add to that virtue, and to that brotherly kindness (Second Peter
        1:7), until you’re built in the full stature of Christ, then the last thing IS LOVE, WHICH
        GOD, THE HOLY SPIRIT, SEALS YOU TO YOUR DESTINATION. You can’t impersonate.
        You can impersonate it, but as I said last night, it’s just like a—a blackbird putting peacock
        feathers in his wings and saying, “See, I’m a peacock.” He just added them, pushed them in. If
        there’s something on the inside of him, made him push them out, he’d actually be a peacock.
        Certainly. But some people are trying to do something to look like somebody else, or
        impersonate somebody else, because they thought they did it. And you see what it does? It brings
        us back into a ritual and form again. IT’S THE BLOOD, THE LIFE THAT ELECTRIFIES
        AND SANCTIFIES YOUR LIFE. That’s right. 38 Isaiah spilled it out to them and said, “God
        said that He’s hiding His face from your prayers. You’ve got your ritualistic form, yet it’s the
        truth. You’re doing what He told you, but you’re not doing it in sincerity. And you squall out day
        and night, but God said, ‘Your sacrifice is a stink to me, and I will not receive it any more. And
        when you pray under such conditions, I’ll hide My face from you.’” Oh, God. If people would
        think of that, it would start a Pentecost. God said, “Though you be correctly in the Word…”
        But if you don’t do it with love and sincerity, God said He would hide His face, and wouldn’t
        hear your prayers. See? That’s the way. 39 Oh, you said that “You’re taking under the Old
        Testament, Brother Branham.” All right. Let’s take the New Testament, Second Timothy 3. THE
        HOLY SPIRIT WARNED US THAT IN THE LAST DAYS THAT THE CHURCH WOULD
        GET AWAY FROM THE SINCERITY AND THE FAITH. THEY’D HAVE A FORM OF
        GODLINESS, BUT WOULD DENY THE POWER THAT WENT WITH THE RIGHT
        THING, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT DENYING THE POWER THEREOF.
        YES, SIR. GOD HATES A POWERLESS RELIGION. AND ANY RELIGION TODAY THAT
        HASN’T GOT CHRIST IN IT, IS POWERLESS. BUT ANY RELIGION THAT CHRIST IN
        IS UNDER HIS OWN BLOOD, AND IT’S GOT POWER IN IT. You say God hates a religion
        without power? He said, “Your solemn feasts is a stink.” I guess He does hate it. He said,
        “It—it makes Me sick.” And remember, He told this rich Laodicean church that “Because
        you’re lukewarm (in other words, you make Me sick), I’ll spue you out of My mouth.” And
        we’ve come to that age. God, send us an Isaiah to chop the thing to pieces, lay it out before the
        people: cry out; spare not. You think he’d be accepted? Certainly not. But he’d cry just the same.
        Solemn feasts, they’re a stink. God hates powerless religion. It’s got to have power in it. It’s got
        to have sincerity. Sincerity brings power. Sincerity brings real worship, not forms, but genuine
        power worship to know that you’ve passed from death unto Life. 40 God wants to perform His
        Word by His power. And when the church denies His power, how can He perform and
        vindicate His Word? When the church explains it away and says it’s for some other day, and
        something, how can God, Who wants to—to fulfill His Word, and perform His Word among the
        people… And the people deny that He does it. Yet, they go through all the rituals. See? Here’s
        what’s happened. GOD WANTS TO PERFORM BY THE HOLY GHOST, AND VINDICATE
        HIS WORD; AND THE CHURCH WANTS TO PERFORM. They have to deny the Holy
        Ghost. They want to perform to make a big organization, and what else? To bring membership,
        
        46
        no matter what you have to baptize sinners, drunkards, bootleggers, anything else, and take them
        into the body of the church. No wonder Revelation 17 said this old prostitute woman, that had a
        bunch of daughters, that she was full of names, or blasphemous names. Churches, or daughtercalling the names of her daughters… People who join churches and call that “got salvation,”
        it’s a blasphemy. Now, I know the King James here said, “names of blasphemy,” but you look
        in the Diaglott, and see if it is. It says, “Blasphemous names.” There’s quite a difference. She
        is full of those. She’s got nine hundred and something different organizations in her, plenty of
        blasphemous names. Got away, by some man-made tradition got away from the true worship,
        power out of the… 41 Oh, you say, “I went down there, and there’s a lot of power. Brother,
        the whole floor was dancing in the Spirit,” AND NOT ENOUGH FAITH TO HEAL A
        TOOTHACHE. YOU CALL THAT POWER? THAT’S NOT POWER. THAT’S BLESSINGS.
        THERE’S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLESSINGS AND POWER. God makes
        His blessings upon the righteous and unrighteous. The sun shines and… See? WE GOT TO GET
        BACK TO TRUTH, FRIENDS. WE GOT TO COME BACK TO WHAT GOD MEANS. What
        He says, He means. See? And He refused their… Once hid His face from their prayers…
         Preachers don’t like that, I tell you, boy, they don’t like it. Oh, you preach that to the
        preachers in this Message, and boy, they’ll fluff up their feathers, I tell ya. What you gonna do
        with it? Dare tell me He wasn’t Born. He was already Born, Jesus was already Born, right? And,
        He didn’t have no Power for Service. He didn’t work a miracle. Jesus never worked a miracle.
        He never done a sign, He never done a wonder, and He went down to the river Jordan, and there
        the Holy Ghost descended upon Him like a dove. The Power of the Holy Ghost, and the
        anointing of the Holy Ghost come upon Him, and He went into the wilderness to be tested, and
        He come out healing the lepers, right? Opening the blinded eyes, raised Lazarus from the dead
        and worked miracle after miracle, after miracle.
        Luke 4:1-2-Reference quote:
        1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into
        the wilderness,
        2 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they
        were ended, he afterward hungered.

        him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
        41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him,
        I will; be thou clean.
        42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was
        cleansed.

        35 Beautiful! God took Christ, at Calvary, tore Him apart, Soul and Body. He sent it, the Body,

        of the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your faith. 36 You say you “believe, and haven’t
        received the Holy Spirit”? Something wrong with your faith. God circumcises the heart the

        done something, I felt that even come back. Get it! When the believer…Here it is now! When the

        Ghost. Confirmation of his faith! Say, “What’s the matter, Brother Branham?” Just your faith,
        that’s all. If you truly believe, God’s there to give It to you. 37 “While Peter spake these Words,
        the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the Word.” Is that right? Acts 10:49. All right, notice,

        53 You see, Satan uses a man’s head. He chose that in the garden of Eden, to take a man’s
        head, his thinking. And he has brought that down even to the church. See, the devil takes a
        man’s head, so he can use his eye. And if you’ll notice, if the man isn’t genuinely born again,
        spiritual, he’ll take what he can see with his eyes, the pride of life. And he’ll go, many man, to
        say he’s going to—to achieve something, he wants to join church. He wants to be religious. And
        he’ll look around till he can find the biggest church he can find, because man wants to do
        something big. He wants to make a big name for himself. That’s what carnal, foolish-thinking
        man think, “Oh, if I can have my organization! If I can only add so-many thousands to my
        denomination, it’ll be the largest then in the land, of its kind!” What good does that do? But he
        thinks he’s achieving something because he’s adding more. 54 I believe it was some years ago,
        in 1944, that the Baptists had a slogan out, “A million more in ’44.” And what did they have
        when they got a million more? Just like joining a lodge, if they wasn’t genuine, born-again
        disciples of Christ. They were just Baptist by name. 55 Look at the other denominations, the
        Lutheran, the Presbyterian, the Pentecostals, all the other denominations, they’re the same.
        They’re trying to achieve something. They want to do something great, see, because it’s his eye
        he’s looking at. He thinks with his eye. And many times he don’t understand that that’s the thing
        that he oughtn’t to do. But, the devil takes the man’s eye, he shows him something pretty. He
        opens his eyes to look at it. And he’s got that into the church, into the intellectual thinking of
        man. 56 Sometime ago, this great evangelist, Billy Graham, stood here in Louisville, and held up
        his Bible. He said, “This is God’s standard.” And he’s right. He’s exactly right. Mordecai Ham,
        the evangelist, (my old Kentucky home), and I, were sitting at the same table; which, Billy was
        converted under Mordecai Ham. And we were sitting there. And he said, “What happens?” He
        said, “Paul went into a city and got one convert, he returned a year later and he had thirty by
        that one.” Said, “I go into a city and have twenty thousand converts, return in a year and can’t
        find twenty. Something is wrong.” And he said, “You know what it is? It’s you lazy preachers
        that set in the buildings, your offices, with your feet on the desk, and don’t go visit the people.”
        57 I thought, “Billy, that’s a very good intellectual,” please don’t quote me, “but that isn’t it.”
        Who was the pastors that went to that one that Paul got converted? 58 It wasn’t that. It’s here.
        Those so-called meetings today, and they are great meetings, BUT IT ONLY WORKS ON
        THE INTELLECTUAL PART OF MAN. A man gets under the spell of a revival, and he says,
        “Yes, I accept Christ,” and he does it INTELLECTUALLY because he’s in a great crowd. He
        does it because there’s great ministers before him, but it’s only AN INTELLECTUAL
        CONCEPTION. That man can never go on. HE’S GOT TO COME FROM HIS MIND, TO
        HIS HEART, AND BE BORN AGAIN, OR HE’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO STAND THE
        TEST. 59 Intellectual conception is all right, but when…Remember, when the eye looks upon it,
        the devil uses your eye. In the garden of Eden, it proved that the devil chose the head of man,
        to work in, but GOD CHOOSES HIS HEART. The devil shows him, with his eyes, something
        that he can see, and he says, “Seeing is believing.” 60 BUT WHEN GOD COMES TO A
        
        50
        MAN, HE COMES TO HIS HEART. AND HE LETS HIM BELIEVE THINGS BY HIS
        HEART, THROUGH FAITH, THAT HIS EYES DOES NOT SEE. FOR THE SCRIPTURE
        SAYS, THAT, “THE FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS HOPED FOR, THE
        EVIDENCE OF THINGS NOT SEEN.” 61 God working here; Satan working here. So what
        good does these big schools and seminaries do anyhow? It sometimes, not always, but too many
        times, it pulls from here, up to here; when it ought to be taken from here, down to here in the
        man’s heart. 62 You know, the Scripture says, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”
         So, that’s why I’ve got no confidence in the flesh, children. It goes, you may go right on and
        do good, but, brother, sister, if you say you got that great Baptism of the Holy Ghost, you got
        that great New Birth and you don’t have It. The devil… God will let the devil come right around
        and let you…let you prove to yourself that you don’t have what you’re talking about. Then you
        better weep your way to Christ, and get Something Real. See! Because he that is Born of Faith,
        Revelation cannot doubt the preaching of That right there. And, any man that will fight that

        when power comes into that Birth for service.
         I’m afraid that we’re getting to a place to where we’re a bunch of know-it-alls. And, any time
        you get to think that you’re a know it all, you don’t know nothing. You gotta realize you don’t
        have nothing, you don’t know nothing, to get something.
        Listen to this, “Leadership” (65-1207 WMB.) preached in Covina, California. I guess it’s that,
        you know I don’t spell too good. So, nobody can read my notes anyway, but me. So, 12/07/65
        it’s preached. Bro. Branham made this statement, listen to this, “You can have the Baptism of
        the Holy Ghost every hour of your life, and still be lost and go to hell.” Come on now, if I had
        the preachers here tonight, then if you say the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is the New Birth, you
        don’t believe in the Eternal Security of the believer than, do you?
         Cause, you’re saying that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is the New Birth, and Bro. Branham
        said, “You could have the Baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life and go to hell.”
        Then what about your Eternal Security of the believer? How can you be Born Again and Eternal
        Secure with God, and then go to hell? Would you give me a Scripture for that?
         The Bible said, “Those whom He justified, those who He sanctified, He has already filled
        with the Holy Ghost.” So, how could you have the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, if that’s the New
        Birth, and then go to hell? But, Bro. Branham said, “You could have the Baptism of the Holy
        Ghost and go to hell.”

        62 The choice of your conduct. You could…You can’t mix it now. You’re either for God or
        against God, and the outward expressions shows exactly what’s on the inside. See? The
        cocklebur…Many of you think, “I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I’m going to Heaven.”
        That don’t mean one thing that you’re going to Heaven. No, sir. You can have the baptism of
        the Holy Ghost every hour in your life, and still be lost and go to hell. The Bible says so. Uhhuh, that’s exactly right.
         Now, let me show you something here. Supposing this Baptism of the Holy Ghost would
        come upon you, and you didn’t have the New Birth? If you don’t have the New Birth, you don’t
        have any Life down in your soul. You don’t have any Seed of God down in your soul. The Life
        is in the Seed, and the Seed is Faith. And, if you don’t have any Seed of Life down in your soul,
        you don’t have any Virtue, you don’t have any godly Knowledge, you don’t have any godly
        Temperance, you don’t have godly Patience, you don’t have Godliness, you don’t have Brotherly
        Kindness, and then you pray and fast until the Baptism of Power comes upon you, and when it
        does, it blows your feathers out!
         And, you get to thinking you’re a great big somebody, and stick your chest out, get you a little
        book, get you a tent, put a great big sign on your truck, Divine Deliverance Ministry. And, you
        can’t even deliver your own self. And, then what happens? You go out and you work a sign or a
        wonder, and then you go to hell. And, then, before you go to the Judgement some little brother
        will come by, that’s got the New Birth, that’s got Virtue, got Knowledge, got Temperance, got
        Patience, got Godliness, got Brotherly Kindness, and he waits upon the Word of the Lord, and
        the Lord speaks to him and says, “Now, son, go out on the field with this Revelation, and he goes
        out there and comes by with God Tabernacled in human flesh, and that preacher, that went out
        there and got the Baptism and didn’t have the New Birth, didn’t have all these things, and said he
        had the Baptism. He come up against that ministry and then he finds out that ministry just
        stripped everything down he’s got. Got more power than anything he’s ever seen before.
        Everything about It, you can’t do nothing with It, It’s got Faith, Virtue, Knowledge, Temperance,
        Patience, Godliness. It’s a walking Epistle known and read of all men. It shows up his old dirty,
        filthy heart, and shows what it is, and he gets all scared, like the man that was up there with
        Philip, went up to Samaria and had a great revival, and there was a man up there, about like some
        of the preachers out on the field today giving out that he was the great power of God.
         And, he said all believed from the least to the greatest, that he had the revelation, that he was
        the power of God. But, when that little Philip come up there, that had Faith, Virtue, Knowledge,
        Patience, Brotherly Kindness he had the real true Baptism to go with the New Birth. He come up
        there, and cast out devils by the Word, healed the sick, raised the dead, opened the blinded eyes,
        and there was great joy in the city.
         And, brother, people got shook up that Simon was the great power of God. They begin to find
        out that Simon was nothing but a soothsayer, and had deceived them, and old Simon himself
        began to repent, and got baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus.
        
        53
         That’s a whole lot like the preachers out here today, that’s going to run up against men that’s
        got this Thing here that’s waiting on God, and that little Bride goes out on the field with that
        Revelation with the Baptism of the Holy Ghost with the New Birth, and the Power of God in
        That making them written Epistles read and known of all men, and goes out there and begins to
        speak the Word and God, not only heals the sick, but creating arms and legs, and eyes and
        everything back on people by the Spoken Word, they’re gonna run and cry and repent and all
        down before them and say, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied, have we not healed the sick,
        have we not cast out devils in Thy Name? And, the Voice will speak back and say, “Depart from
        Me, you workers of iniquity, I never did know you.”
        2 Corinthians 3:2-Reference quote:
        2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
        Matthew 7:22-23-Reference quote:
        22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
        name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
        23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

        168 And I said, “Now here is the way we believe it. Here comes along…Jesus came by, one day,
        and there was a tree standing there. And He said…He looked for a fruit, and there was no fruit,
        and He said, ‘No man eateth from thee, from…for evermore,’ went on away. And the next day,
        when they passed by, that tree was withering. Peter said…Why, you know Peter—Peter, how he
        was. He—he said, ‘Why, look at the tree! Behold it.’ And Jesus said, ‘Have faith in God. For if
        you would say to this mountain, “Be moved,” and don’t doubt, but believe that what you say
        shall come to pass, you’ll have what you say.’” I said, “You get that?” “Yeah.” 169 “‘When you
        pray, believe that you receive what you ask for, ye shall have it.’” 170 I said, “See, we, after
        receiving the Spirit of God…Now, God made the world out of nothing. It’s just His Word. He just
        created. His Word is creation. So, He just spoke It, and the world was created. Because, It was
        the object in God’s mind, in His heart. He just spoke it, and it come into existence. He was a
        
        54
        Creator.” I SAID, “THEN, IF WE HAVE ZOE, GOD’S LIFE IN US, WE BECOME SONS
        OF GOD, AND AMATEUR CREATORS,” I SAID, “ ’CAUSE HE SAID, ‘WHATEVER YOU
        SAY, BELIEVE THAT WHAT YOU SAY, YOU SHALL HAVE.” 171 And I’ve noticed that. A
        lot of times, I’d say things that I couldn’t hardly think myself, but I’d say it, anyhow. And I come
        to find out, it did happen just that way. I’d say things I didn’t hardly didn’t mean for it to happen
        that way, but it did, anyhow, because I had said it. I thought, “Wait a minute!” 172 So, I said,
        “You see, when we speak anything, if something is anchored to us, we shouldn’t never speak it
        till we believe it. THEN WHEN WE BELIEVE IT, WE SPEAK IT, AND THAT CREATIVE
        WORD GOES OUT. IT’S A PART OF GOD, SEE, AND IT CREATED.”

        78 But, oh, my, we’ve stood on that Rock, that’s True, UNTO THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
        GHOST, AND NOW THE POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD IS FORMED IN THE CHURCH,
        COMING FORTH. Hallelujah! I’m looking for when God is going to shake the whole thing,
        everywhere. Brother, it’s already in session right now. It’s going on. That’s right. 79 The Deity
        of Him. Who is He? Some of them makes Him a little baby back there. He is the One that stood
        on the invisible, oh, my, platform, raked out His hands, and spoke and said, “Let there be light,”
        and there was light. That was Jesus Christ. “For He was in the world, and the world was made
        by Him, and the world recognized Him not.” He was…He is the Deity of God. Look what He did
        back there. Talk about the miraculous back there; you talk about shouting? When He performed
        the miraculous things, to make things which are now, out of things which was not, HE SPOKE
        AND IT WAS SO. 80 AND THAT SAME POWER, THAT SAME CHRIST! Hallelujah! Let
        the fundamentalists, let them people who deny the Power of God, say It’s wrong, but that same
        Power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that’s got the Holy Ghost. That’s
        right. Men and women, it’s time that we found out who you are. The devil is trying to hide you
        back, tell you that you’re some little cowed-down something. You’re not. YOU ARE SONS AND
        DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THE DEITY IS NOT IN HEAVEN; IT’S IN YOU. HALLELUJAH!
        I know you think I’m crazy, but let me tell you something, brother. [Brother Branham knocks on
        the pulpit three times—Ed.] When you realize that Almighty God lives in you; immortal Life,
        “My Life I give, Zoe.” The Life of God is in the human being. 81 He stood back there, He’s
        the Creator of all things. He made life; frogs, oh, bees, ducks, chickens, animals, created
        everything. “AND NOTHING WAS MADE BUT WHAT WAS MADE BY HIM.” WHO?
        CHRIST, THE DEITY! “He brought down plagues, and everything in the days of Egypt.”
        Who? Christ! “He stopped the—the mouths of lion. He quenched the violence of fire. They
        escaped the edge of the sword. THEY RAISED THE DEAD FROM THE GRAVE.” WHO?
        CHRIST! OH, MY, WHAT WILL IT BE! WHO IS HE? CHRIST, THE DEITY! 82 And,
        brother, sister, that Deity is in you. “A little while and the world seeth Me no more. Yet you shall
        see Me, for I’ll be with you, even in you, to the end of the age.” Christ in the manger? No.
        CHRIST IN YOU! Hallelujah! We’re not worshipping Christ in the manger, but Christ in you,
        the Holy Ghost, the hope of Life, hallelujah, the Creator, God Himself dwelling in the human
        being. “It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we’ll see Him as He is.” For we’ll be made

        William Marrion Branham
        37 Now, you see, Jesus had proven to God that He’d been the right kind of Son. And God took
        Him up on the top of the mountain, brought witnesses out there—heavenly witnesses and earthly
        witnesses—and He clothed Him in immortality. When they looked up, they said, “His garments
        shined like the sun.” A supernatural something taken place. His garments glistened like the sun
        in its middle of the day, as white as they could be. God placed on Him that robe of immortality,
        showing that He had received Him. That’s the thing that God will do to His sons here on earth
        someday. He will call you aside, Church, if you’ll only obey Him and stay on the Word and
        believe it. And He will place into the Church, before the coming of Jesus Christ… He will
        place into the Church… All the powers that Christ had in Him will be in the Church. All that
        God was, He poured into Jesus; all that Jesus was, He pours into the Church. God wanting
        His work done, He sent it into His Son; the Son wanting the work done, sent it into the
        Church. “At that day you’ll know that I’m in the Father, the Father in Me, and I in you, and
        you in Me.” At that day, because the same power of God, was in Jehovah God, rested in Jesus
        Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ, rests in the placed sons in the body of
        Christ. 38 Placing of a son… Take him out in a certain place, have a ceremony before Angels,
        and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ. Then that person has the
        authority. Let me say this, if you count me a fanatic from this night on. That very same thing that
        
        56
        I’m speaking of will be done. THERE’LL BE A POWER PUT INTO THE CHURCH, AND
        NOW IS COMING IN, THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL SO ANOINT THE PEOPLE, TILL
        THEY’LL SPEAK THE WORD AND IT’LL CREATE ITSELF RIGHT THERE. WE
        HAVEN’T SEEN POWERS LIKE’S COMING INTO THE CHURCH NOW. I KNOW IT
        FOR A FACT. “Say unto this mountain be moved. Don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that
        what you’ve said shall come to pass, you can have what you have said”: THE PLACING OF
        THE CHURCH IN POSITION, WHERE THE FULNESS OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY
        GHOST COMES INTO THE CHURCH. THEN CRITICS’ MOUTHS WILL BE SHUT.
        IT’LL BE A SHORT TIME. Jesus come right off the mountain, went straight to Calvary.
        Notice, it won’t last long, but it’ll be here.
         So, that’s why Bro. Branham said, “You can have the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and go to
        hell.” You know, I’ll say this, “You cannot have the New Birth and the True Baptism of the Holy
        Ghost and go to hell, because you are just as Eternal as God is.”
         So, you people that’s hanging on the Baptism of the Holy Ghost as the New Birth, you are
        wrong! Now, notice, if a person continually fights against the preaching of this True Baptism of
        the Holy Ghost, he proves himself an unbeliever, and could very well be an antichrist.

        237 Watch, tomorrow night, what the antichrist is. He’s got a false baptism, making you believe
        it’s the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He’s got a false water baptism (Yes, sir.), which even isn’t
        Scriptural. He’s got all them things, just enough to impersonate, to be cunning and slick.
         Because, remember the Scripture of John, the Apostle, that was never able to recover from
        Judas setting at the supper table? He never recovered from it, and he went on continuing
        preaching about the antichrist. And he was telling the little Bride, “Watch those people that come
        unto you, and tell you that you can’t have the Supernatural God manifested in your flesh, they
        are an antichrist!” How many is gonna take that for the Word of God? You must be Born Again!
        You must be Born Again!
         What good would it do for you to get the Baptism of the Holy Ghost? There’s men fasted
        forty day, went into closets fasted forty days, never drank, never ate any food, drank a little bit of
        water stayed in a closet for forty days, and they saw some kind of vision, and come out with
        some kind of an anointing, and where did they turn out? They turned out to be a bunch of
        drunkards.
         What was it? What caused a man to drink? I’ve seen the man. God showed it to me, I seen
        him laying back there on a couch, drunk, just as soused up as could be, and two handlers, you all
        know who it was, two handlers there tried to get him awake and I seen the Spirit of God go by,
        
        57
        and take away everything that he had, and was gone. Brother, I knew right then, I said, “God, I’ll
        never go to the field, Lord, bear me record, I don’t care who pulls my coat tail and blows my
        head up, I said, “I’ll quit my preaching.” I left the Full Gospel Business Men, I left nobody, I
        wouldn’t go preach nowhere. I had offerings all over the country, from a vision, a visitation of
        the Lord I had in Sarasota, Florida. I had invitations all overseas, they wanted to buy me an
        airplane and everything. I turned it all down.
         And, I went over there, said, “God, I’ll wait for the Word of the Lord, I’ll not move till You
        come.” And, I’m so thankful, friend, that I made that decision, brother. Blessed be the day that I
        made the right decision. And, I see out there what happened to them men that went out there and
        tried to be miracle workers, without the New Birth.
         And, let me say it, “When it rolls around, you’re gonna find out that the people following this
        Message are not even Born Again.” I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard, it’s hard for some of my
        preacher friends to believe it, but they’re beginning to find it out. Like I looked Bro. Ruddell in
        the eye, “what’s wrong, Bro. Bob?” I said, “Do you really want me to tell you?” He said, “Yes,
        sir.” I said, “Bro. Ruddell, number one, the people need the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.” And, I
        said, “But, they need to be Born Again.” And, he sure chewed on that a long time. But I really
        meant that, and I still mean it today.
         You cannot be Born Again, until you receive the Divine Revelation of the Thing that God is
        going to do for the Hour! That’s the New Birth. What is the New Birth? The New Birth is a
        Divine Revelation to you. You may sit right there in your seat, you say, “Well, how can I get a
        Divine Revelation?”
         Alright, I’ll tell you how. You’ll never get a Divine Revelation until you prove to Christ that
        you’re willing to keep His Word. Full Obedience to the Word of God entitles you to a revelation.

        116 And when we can display the Token of the Holy Spirit, shows that we have been accepted
        in Christ, and that is our Token that all that we have need of is already purchased by Him. We
        are identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 117 The Blood, Covenant Blood, is not
        recognized without the Token. The Word assures us of the promise. The Token is the sign the
        purchase has been made for us. 118 FULL OBEDIENCE TO THE FULL WORD OF GOD
        ENTITLES US TO THE TOKEN. NO OTHER WAY IS THERE, THAT YOU COULD EVER
        BE ENTITLED TO THE TOKEN, UNTIL YOU FULLY OBEY THE WORD. Not what
        somebody has put into It, and added to It; but what God said about It! 119 When He said, “You
        must be born again.” That don’t mean jump up-and-down at the altar; that don’t mean walk
        back there and shake hands with the pastor; that don’t mean all this foolishness that we’ve seen
        done; it don’t mean putting your name on a church book. It means death to your first being, and
        Life to the second being. It means that the Blood has been applied, and you’re identified by the
        Life of Jesus Christ. And if He be the Vine, and we be the branches, the Life that’s in the
        branch is in also from the Vine. It’ll bear the fruit. 120 If that first branch come forth, that
        branch out of that Vine, that wrote a book of Acts behind it; if that branch ever puts forth, a
        Vine puts forth another branch, they’ll write another book of Acts behind it, ’cause it’s the
        
        58
        same Life. If a one of your grapevines out here brings forth blue grapes, if it puts forth another
        branch, it’ll bring forth blue grapes. 121 And I tell you, today, we got so many grafted vines into
        It, with denominations and creeds and things, and yet any citrus fruit grafted in can live, live in
        that Vine. But it’s bearing the wrong fruit. 122 What we need, today, is another baptism of the
        Holy Spirit, and have the real Power of God that identifies the works that Jesus Christ
        promised for this day, not so much as that day. This day, the promise that He made here. That
        was what He promised there, He would pour out His Spirit. Now He has promised it again in
        the last days, and what He would do.

        UNTIL WE COMPLETELY SURRENDER OURSELVES TO GOD, IN OBEDIENCE TO
        ALL OF HIS WORD… GOD DON’T GIVE US THE HOLY GHOST AND SAY, “WELL, I
        GOT IT. THAT’S ALL THERE IS TO IT.” NO, SIR. HE GIVE YOU THE HOLY SPIRIT
        FOR ACTION, FOR WORD, FOR SERVICE. Until we obey, hunger in our hearts… There’s
        enough Pentecostal people setting right in here tonight, to start a Pentecostal revival through
        this country here, that would—it would certainly do things around here, if we’d just get the fire
        burning good, you know, and get the high wind blowing from heaven, like rushing mighty
        wind, something would take place.
         In other words, if the Bible says, “Don’t cut your hair, women don’t you trim your hair.” The
        Bible says, “Women dress yourself in modest apparel, you strive to dress in modest apparel.
        And, the Bible said, for the husband to be the head of the house, and love his wife, you do it, you
        do it, you be obedient. The Bible said, honor your pastor, you honor your pastor. The Bible said,
        you respect on another, you respect one another. The Bible said, you love one another, you love
        one another. The Bible said you come to service, you worship the Lord, you do that.
         And, when you show the Lord you mean business with God, and you continually give
        yourself to the Word of God, and you want God, you want the Truth, you want the Baptism of
        the Holy Ghost, and you continually give yourself to the Word of God, then, if you’ll prove to
        God, you mean business and you line up with His Word. Now, look, children, I know, I’ve seen
        many a good person that I love, and I love them, and I’ve seen them come and hear this ministry,
        and I know they’re not able to pay their tithes. God knows, I don’t want your tithes. Haven’t I
        proved that to ya? Haven’t I paid my own way for year after year, laid on the ground and ate
        crackers. My wife and I ate bologna and her pregnant, no money for the doctor bill and no way
        to go to the hospital. Old car fifteen years old, just nursing along twenty-five, thirty miles an
        hour, old slick tires. Didn’t know hardly where we’d lay our head, searching for somebody to
        believe the Truth. I never took tithes, money from nobody, handed it to me, and I’d turn it away.
        Because I didn’t want them to think that I was like all the rest of the preachers that I just wanted
        their money, so we suffered. Then God blessed me for it.
         But, not that I, I never preached about tithing. That’s up to you. And you say when your tithes
        are coming in, do I have one of those little tithe envelopes got your name on it? Do I?
        
        59
        (Congregation says, “No.”) Do ever wonder why? Do I ever come to you and say, “Well now,
        we spent this for that, and we’ve done this. Have you ever heard me do that? (Congregation says,
        “No.”) It’s none of your business whatsoever. Those tithes do not even belong to you, they
        belong to the Lord.
         And, I tell you what, how I feel about it, if I didn’t believe that man was a man of God, I
        wouldn’t even be setting under his ministry. And, if you can’t trust him with 10%, a dime out of
        a dollar, honey, you better not trust him with your soul. How many say, “Amen” to that?
        (Congregation says, “Amen.”) But, if you can trust him with your soul, surely you can trust him
        with a dime out of a dollar. How many say, Amen? (Congregation says, “Amen”)
         But, let me tell you, I know good people, I know good people that over the past years has
        come to this assembly, and I know good and well and they’ll testify, and they’ll sing, and shout,
        and I know good and well, what’s keeping them away from the Kingdom. I know that they’re not
        able to pay their tithes, I know that they are not able to do this thing, and I know that they’re not
        able to do that thing. I don’t say nothing, I just let it go right on, and I mix it right in the
        preaching as I go along, and they go along, and think maybe you don’t know nothing about it,
        but I know. And, I know that they’re not Born Again, and I know that they’ll never see the
        Baptism of the Holy Ghost, and I know they are just as Tribulation bound as can be. But, what
        can I do about it?
         If, you can’t even obey God in the little things, how in the world are you going to do the big
        things? If we can’t even line up with these little trivial things like hospitality, generosity and
        kindness and tithes and offerings, and being faithful to come to service, in the Word of God, how
        in the world are we gonna do great things for God?
         So, what happened? You give yourself to the Word of God continually. That should be
        number one in your life, is to give yourself to the Word of God and Prayer. Those two virtues
        you must keep, and that is, the Word of God and Prayer, you’re obligated to the Word of God
        and Prayer. That’s why I think all you people ought to strive to get here to either the Friday night
        prayer meeting or the Saturday night prayer meeting, and you certainly ought to pray at home.
        We should never let down on our responsibility to God in prayer, prayer to God and reading the
        Word, and giving ourselves to the tapes, give ourselves to the tapes. And, you say, “Well, I heard
        that tape.” No, you didn’t! You hear that tape over and over again, and when you hear it over and
        over again, if you’re obedient, one time you’ll hear it, and you’ll hear it right. But, when you
        think, you’ll just put on a tape, casually, and, “Oh, I go it”, and you’ll find out you ain’t.
         I’ve seen people set here for two years shouting, screaming, hollering and where are they at
        today? They’re gone. And, then have them come back crying saying how they’re deceived. Well,
        what are you going to do?
         But, if you give yourself continually to the Word of God and Prayer, and you mean business
        with God, you really mean business with God, and He knows it, He knows your heart. You can’t
        fool Him. Then what happens? Then, one day you’ll be setting there listening to the Word of
        God either on tape or in service, and all at once you get it! That’s the New Birth.
         Now, nobody can give that to you. Now somebody that’s got the Revelation, and I continually
        told the brothers here when new people come, I don’t desire that you brothers try to give them
        your revelation. Because when you, when it comes first handed from the Lord, see? Now, the
        only reason that I can say what Bro. Branham said, and saying it right, and I said it right and I
        trust that I am, and I believe that I am. The only way that I could ever say it, that is if I get a
        direct Divine Revelation the same way he did, from the Holy Ghost. Then I don’t pervert the
        Message, but I keep it pure. I keep it pure by a Divine Revelation of the Holy Ghost.
        
        60
         Now, if somebody comes, and you brothers say, “Aw now, this is this and this is that.” Don’t
        do that, don’t do that. Just love that brother, and let that brother see your life. Don’t try to give
        him the Revelation. See, if you’re called to preach it, then come up here and preach. Don’t you
        preach it, you live it. See? You’re called to live it, you’re not called to preach it. Here’s where
        it’s called to preach it. If, you’re called to preach it, come up here. How many say, “Amen to
        that?” (Congregation says, “Amen.”) You live it, and let that brother see it, and then you go on,
        and what will happen, he’ll get the same Revelation you got, and he’ll be all excited about it.
        And, you’ll just smile, and it’ll just please you.
         But, you see, if you try to pump the Revelation into him yourself, then you may give him a
        second-hand revelation. And, he may only memorize what you’re saying with a head knowledge,
        and it won’t be the New Birth. Leave him alone, leave him alone. Let God do it.
         Now, notice here, your intellectual faith, you’ll say, “Alright the Bible says, These signs shall
        follow them that believe.” “Yes, Lord, amen, Lord, that’s right, we’re short, Lord, amen. You
        said it, God, and we need it.” See? The Bible says, “Dress yourself in modest apparel, amen,
        Lord, I’ve got to let my dress down a little longer and my knees are showing. The prophet said,
        it’s a shame. And, Lord, I’m just ashamed and I want You to help me.” And, you men, if you’re
        not the kind of husband you should be, you come to your wife and say, “Honey, I’m sorry, I need
        to be a better husband, and I want you to forgive me, and I want to strive to do better.”
         And, now you keep trying that way, and your obedient, and God the Holy Ghost come back
        and say, you know, “Your son, brother, is doing a lot better, he’s doing a lot better.” He said,
        “You know this little girl she’s trying so hard, Lord, and the Lord say, “Yes, I’ve been watching
        her, said, I’m ready to give her Something.” And then you know, you come into service and all at
        once the Word of God… before your spirit was asleep. I know, I see people come and I know
        their spirit is sleeping. And, I don’t mean your eyes is closed, sleeping that way, but I mean your
        spirit’s a sleeping. I know it, you can’t fool. I know that you don’t have no revelation, and I
        know that revelation is bouncing right off your ears…bouncing right off your ears and then I’ll
        watch you, you go on, it may take six months, and all at once I’ll be preaching and I’ll look back
        and see you different. And, then I know right then it’s changed, and I’ll watch your life. Some
        little teenagers, they don’t know, I never say anything about it. But I’ve seen that spirit when it’s
        upon them. I see it when it’s on them and I see it when it’s off. I see them when they’re trying to
        go for God, and I see them when the devil is trying to take them away, but you stay, stay right
        there, and you’re obedient to the Word of God, you’re obedient to the Word of God, and then
        what happens? When you really mean business with God, and then one day you’ll come to
        service, and you’ll be listening to a tape, and then all at once, you’ll be setting there and you
        don’t realize it, you can’t see it, but, the Holy Ghost slips right around you, right around you.
         And, all at once you’re listening to a tape, and, “Wham”, it just hits you, whew, and down
        inside you get ahold of Something and you know it. And, when you get That, you may not be
        able to explain that, but you know that Something happened down on the inside. And, all at once,
        just Something happened, you ain’t, there’s Something changed, you’re not like you was, your
        desires are different.
         And, now the Thing has just become alive to you. Then you find out that you got Something
        down there, that if you can’t hear the Word of God, you’ll die. If you don’t get where It’s at,
        you’ll just die. If, you can’t stay with the people of God, you’ll just soon die. You just got to get
        there, oh, you’re all excited about what God is going to do, God’s Promise, and, what it is you’re
        stimulated. You’re stimulated, see?
        
        61
         And, that stimulation causes you to leave, well, like Jimmy don’t mind if I, he called his
        daddy and wanted to borrow some money, help him borrow some money. He said, “Daddy, I
        need some money.” Well, he knew daddy had it, but thought maybe daddy would let him have it.
        Daddy said, “Well, Jimmy, you come home, and we’ll get the money.” “Aw, daddy,” he said, “I
        couldn’t do that, I’ve got a Promise.” Now, see, if Jimmy never had that down there, see it’s too
        much. See? Said, “Well, why struggle you know our church ain’t too bad down there, and you
        know I love the Lord, and you don’t have to be here, and, oh, God don’t expect you to give up
        your home and your job, and go up there and maybe not have you know. Uh huh…Yeah, “I’ve
        got an oxen, and I’ve got to go try them out.” Yeah, “I just married a wife, and I can’t come.”
        Luke 14:15-20-Reference quote:
        15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed
        is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
        16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:
        17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are
        now ready.
        18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a
        piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
        19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have
        me excused.
        20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
         But, oh, brother when you can, when you say, “Yes, Lord, yes, God, if I can just get That, and
        you, oh, God, if I can just get the Baptism. Just like old Bro. William, said, and I went in,
        laughing, he come over the house the other day. I come out making some coffee out in the trailer,
        the electricity was off, and William was pulling some limbs out, broken limbs. And He said,
        “Brother Bob,” He said, if I can get that Baptism of the Holy Ghost, he said, I won’t have to
        worry about,” he’s worried about his old car, it’s wearing out, see. He paid forty dollars for it,
        and he’s put about 60,000 on it. We make a hundred dollar a month payment, can’t get 20,000
        miles out of mine without putting ball joints on it. He said, “I tell you, Bro. Bob, if I can just get
        that Baptism of the Holy Ghost, I won’t have to worry about my car, that’s his home, hotel
        Chevrolet. He said, “If I can just, he stays up in the apple orchard in his hotel Chevrolet, and he
        said, “If I can just get that Baptism, it wouldn’t make no difference if my old car breaks down, so
        I can go out there and just roll up in the grass, and just be as happy as a bug in a rug.” I said,
        “Amen, William, I said, “That’s right, boy, I said, “If you know you’ve got God tabernacled
        down there, it makes no difference whether you got a cover or you ain’t got no cover.”
         He’s ready to keep you warm and you just got everything you need. So, why, we won’t need
        to pray to Him way off, He’s right there. That’s right, William.
         Well, let me read another one here. How many is firmly convinced that the New Birth is
        different from the Baptism of the Holy Spirit? Now, what is it, let me say this, what is another
        thing of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost? All right, It’s a Seal! It’s a Seal! Now notice, here, now,
        if all the brethren are right, that says, that Faith is the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the Bible
        said, that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is Ephesians 4:12. Ephesians 4:12 says, “Grieve not the
        
        62
        Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are, or Ephesians 4:30, rather, says, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit
        of God whereby ye are Sealed until the day of your Redemption.”
        Ephesians 4:30-Reference quote:
        30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
        How many here will say, “Amen”, that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Seal of God is
        One and the Same? (Congregation says, “Amen.”)

        First, before this in this, he was converted recently, came in. I’m…He’s wanting to receive the
        baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I want him to get that. That seals him away in the Kingdom of
        God then. “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you’re sealed until the day of your
        redemption.” And in the last days, there’s going to be two classes of people: them that has the
        seal, and the others will have the mark of the beast. That’s right. SO THE SEAL OF THE GOD
        IS THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. Ephesians 4:30. Is that right? The Seal of God…

        53-0906A - Believest Thou This?
        William Marrion Branham
        28 Now, I don’t mean to say you’re not a Christian till you get the Holy Ghost, get that. I mean
        that you’re—THE HOLY GHOST IS THE SEAL OF YOUR FAITH. You see? God—Abraham
        believed God by faith, and then He give him the seal of a promise. You see? AND YOU
        BELIEVE GOD BY FAITH AND YOU’RE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH, BUT YOU’RE SEALED
        INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
         How many believe that there is only One way to get into the Body, and that is First,
        somebody give me the Scripture. What is the only formula written in the Bible for a person to
        enter into the Body? There is only One way that you can come into the Body of Christ, and that
        is by One Holy Ghost Baptism. But you must be Born Again. See? You’ve got to become the
        Word of God, before you are placed into the Body.
         How many understand it? Is it not going to be a Word Body? You’ve got to have the New
        Birth, you’ve got to be Word, Word, Word. Now, does God give you a Faith Revelation on the
        Word and then you add unbelief, and a little more Faith, unbelief, more Faith and unbelief? Or,
        is He going to have a Word Body? Word, Word, Word, Word, Word, Word and then it comes in
        to the Body, and then the Body is a Complete Word of God!

        In these last days the true Bride Church (Christ’s seed) will come to the Headstone, AND SHE
        WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A SUPER RACE, AS SHE NEARS HIM. They in the
        bride will be so much like Him that they will even be in His very image. This is in order to be

        Building on The Rock 5/14/70 Pm.
        Robert Lee Lambert
        Listen this gospel is only to one class of people, and that’s the elected Bride of Christ. The Bible
        was written to the Bride of Christ. Mark 16:15, John 14:12, Hebrews 13:8, Hebrews 4:12, it’s
        for the bride of Jesus Christ. THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST IS TO TAKE THIS
        MESSAGE INTO ALL THE WORLD. Nobody else! And she waits upon the Lord. She builds
        upon a solid Revelation of the word of God by a Divine Revelation. AND THEN SHE WAITS
        THERE AND WHEN THE RAIN COMES POURING DOWN UPON HER IT’LL WATER
        THE WORD AND MAKE IT MANIFEST AND SHE’LL GO FORTH AND SHE’LL BE A
        LIVING MASTERPIECE.
         So, God is making a human, He don’t take a human cell, a cow cell, a dog cell, a horse cell, a
        mule cell, a camel cell, and it comes out a many membered creature. No, when it comes out it’s a
        human. It’s all human from its head to its toe.
         And, the Body is made up of believers that are All the Word of God. They’re Faith,
        everything about them is Faith. The Bible said, “Without Faith it is impossible to please God.”
        Right? But God is a rewarder of what? Of them that what? How … listen, let me tell you
        something, did you know that you can’t even diligently seek after the Promise of God without a
        Revelation?
        Hebrews 11:6-Reference quote:
        6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he
        is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
         Why across the country isn’t the churches and the people following this Message seeking
        God? Because they believe they’ve found what they’re looking for. See? They found what
        they’re looking for. But, now notice here, you’ve got to become the Word of God! Only a Word
        Born people is going into the Body! How do we get into the Body? By the True Baptism of the
        Holy Ghost, which is 1 Corinthians 12:13.
        
        64
        1 Corinthians 12:13-Reference quote:
        13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
        we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
         That’s how you get into the Body. That is the Seal of God. That is the Token. Bro. Branham
        said, on the “Token” (63-0901m WMB.) “The Baptism of the Holy Ghost Is are triumph
        Capstone Baptism of the Holy Ghost. And, that is the Seal of God.”

        63-0901- Token
        William Marrion Branham
        “By one Spirit we’re all baptized into one Body, and sealed there by the Holy Ghost,” among
        this believers like this, “until the day that Jesus rises us up.” Oh, my! Apply the Token. That’s
        what it means to us. We expect this Sacrifice to give us Life, and It does. Then It gives us the
        Token, and we apply the Token, which is the Seal until…Being—being partakers of This, what a
        great thing it is, being partakers, baptized by this one Spirit, into that one myst-…mythical
        Body.
         Now, where does God, the brethren say, we’ve got the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, that’s the
        bottom of the pyramid, the Stature of the Perfect Man begins off with the Baptism of the Holy
        Ghost.” See?
        Now, then, what the Bible said, “That the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is Ephesians 4:30, it’s 1
        Corinthians 12:13, and It’s Acts 2:38, 39, 40.” Peter said, “Ye shall receive the Gift of the Holy
        Ghost, the Gift of the Holy Ghost.” Now, it didn’t say Holy Ghost, he said, “Ye shall receive
        “the Gift” of the Holy Ghost.
        Ephesians 4:30-Reference quote:
        30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
        1 Corinthians 12:13-Reference quote:
        13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
        we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
        Acts 2:38-40-Reference quote:
        38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
        Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
        39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many
        as the Lord our God shall call.
        40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this
        untoward generation.

        163 Now, when you got it like that, then add that to your faith. When you got true virtue, add it
        to your faith. When you can walk out here on the street, live like a Christian, act like a
        Christian, be a Christian, add that to your faith. When you have knowledge… 164 You say,
        “Well, I don’t know now whether this Scripture is just right. Now here is Acts 2:38, I don’t
        know how to go about it with Acts 28:19. I don’t.” ALL RIGHT. YOU DON’T—DON’T ADD
        NOTHING, ’CAUSE YOU AIN’T GOT IT YET. See? What are you going to do? Because, you
        haven’t got knowledge enough to know of God, yet, that the Bible doesn’t contradict Itself. Leave
        it alone. Don’t say no more about it. See? Leave it alone. 165 But when you can see that the
        Scripture is not contradictory, that you can say that; and can see, that, by the revelation of God,
        the whole Word is wrote in mysteries, and only the knowledge of God can reveal It; then when
        you get and say, punctuate every Word of God with an “amen,” then add that to your faith. 166
        Oh, you’re getting to be a pretty good man right now. See? You’re coming up, see. What with?
        With faith, then with virtue, then knowledge. See how it’s building this man? You can see
        there’s no—no way escaping it. THIS IS THE WAY TO BECOME IN THE FULL STATURE
        OF CHRIST. YES, SIR.

        2 Don’t forget now, always remember this, that these are the things that build the servant of
        Christ. See, FAITH FIRST, then virtue. And now remember, the Holy Spirit cannot cap the
        building of God until these things are operating by the Spirit. No matter what you do, see.
        Those are the things that builds the Body of Christ, see, those things. Now, don’t forget that,
        that this HERE IS FIRST, IS YOUR FAITH. Virtue, knowledge, and so forth, is to be added
        to it, UNTIL THE COMPLETE STATURE OF CHRIST IS MADE MANIFEST, THEN THE
        HOLY SPIRIT COMES UPON IT AND SEALS IT AS ONE BODY. These things must be.
        Therefore, Jesus said, “By their fruit they are known.” See, fruit! You could not bear fruit
        without these things to bear it in you. And then when all this takes the place of worldliness
        and—and ungodliness, and so forth, then all unbelief is cast out, then all the things of the
        world is passed away, THEN THERE’S NOTHING BUT A NEW CREATURE IN CHRIST.
        And then Ephesians 4:30 says, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the
        day of your redemption.” SEALED INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD! Now, don’t forget that.
        Keep that in mind now, takes these things first. Then the sealing is the Holy Spirit, the Cap
        that seals us into the Body. All right
         The Holy Ghost, and “the Gift” of the Holy Ghost is two different things. You have got to
        have the Holy Ghost before you get “the Gift” of the Holy Ghost. Now I want to tell you
        
        66
        something people, if God, if God would vindicate this ministry with power and signs and
        wonders, you don’t have to see signs and wonders. You believe because It’s the Word! But, to
        shake the world, it’s got too “live” with Power! If God would vindicate one message that’s
        preached here, it would shake the world, It’d shake the world. And, It’s going to do it!

        7 I’ve never been ashamed and God help me, to always be man enough, to stand up and speak
        my convictions. For if I’m not, I’d be a traitor to Christ. I believe in the old fashion baptizing of
        the Holy Ghost. I believe that a man’s got to be born again, or he’s still a sinner. I believe it’s
        only through the grace of God that he’s called of the Holy Ghost. We do not receive the Holy
        Ghost by faith believing. It’s the free gift of God given to us by God’s grace. That’s where I
        different with my own church. The church that I come from, the Baptist church. They said,
        “You said you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe.” I said, “That’s contrary to the
        Bible.” Paul said in Acts 19, he asked those Baptists up there that was following Apollos; he
        said, “Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?” Not when ye believe, but “since
        you have believed.” You believe first and the Holy Ghost is the gift of God (See?), comes to
        you. It’s a different… Here… Altogether different from being saved, being called out in God.

        146 Moses standing, up-and-down the street, saying, “The evening message is here! It shall
        come to pass, at the end of the fourteen days, you shall gather the congregation together and kill
        the lamb. The whole congregation of Israel shall kill it, putting their hands upon it, identifying
        themselves with it. And the blood shall be struck upon the post, and upon the lintel of the door,
        and, ‘When I see the blood, I’ll pass over you, for it’s a token that you’ve accepted the death of
        the lamb that I have provided for you.’” The blood was the token. 147 Now the Spirit is the
        Token. “You shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.” And when the Blood
        was shed, the Token was sent down on the Day of Pentecost, like a rushing, mighty wind. 148
        
        67
        That was the theme of every apostle. That was, “Have you received the Holy Ghost since you
        believed? Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the
        remission of sins, and you shall receive this gift of the Holy Ghost, for it’s a Token, amen, that
        you’ve passed from death unto Life.” There you are. When that Gen-…Jewish church faded out,
        the Gentiles taken it over, and that perversion like that; now she has come out, to get that
        remnant of the Gentile, for His Name’s sake, the Bride.

        What is it that caused this misunderstanding? The answer is, “EXPERIENCE.” We have gone
        by experience and not the Word. Away with experience as your measuring line. There is only
        one plumb line, only one rod, and that is the WORD. Now watch carefully and get this. Peter
        said, “Repent, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye
        shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” Paul said, “Have ye received the Holy Ghost SINCE
        ye believed?” THIS IS THE WHOLE OF OUR PROBLEM RIGHT HERE. PEOPLE
        REPENT OF THEIR SINS, THEY GET BAPTIZED IN WATER, BUT THEY DON’T GO
        ON AND RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. YOU BELIEVE UNTO RECEIVING THE
        SPIRIT. Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost.
        But the people stop there. They go as far as water and then stop. They believe, and then stop.
        THE BIBLE DOES NOT SAY THAT YOU RECEIVE WHEN YOU BELIEVE. It is, “Have
        you received the Holy Ghost SINCE you believed?” The exact and literal translation is: “Did
        ye, having previously believed, receive the Holy Ghost?” The people believe and then stop. You
        don’t receive the Holy Ghost when you believe UNTO Him, having repented. You go on and
        receive the Holy Ghost. Do you see it? That is what is wrong with our fundamentalists. THEY
        HAVE NO POWER FOR THEY STOP SHORT OF PENTECOST.

         I wish you’d all pray, you, know, I die daily, that’s the truth, I die. I’m just dying. To think
        I’ve waited here since all these years, I’ve hid in this little storefront. I let all the brethren go on,
        saying what they want to say, but, you know, I’m a shepherd. I have a great desire, just haunts
        me night and day, I want to deliver God’s people. And, I’m just so afraid to go out there, and I
        can’t do it. See?
         Little brothers down in Trinidad begging me to come, and I say, “I come,” I can’t! I know
        right now before I write them, they’re waiting for a letter, just wanting me to come so bad. They

        See? I’ve got to keep my word, and it’s just hard And, I wait, see, I come here week after week,

        don’t need revelation, you’re packed full of Revelation here, and the world is dying. They don’t
        have… these little things that you hear all the time… Listen, people, it’ll set the world a flame if
        God will vindicate It. My heart’s desire is, I can’t go to preacher’s churches. Mike said, “Come

        beg people to come and hear me. I don’t want a… Bro. Mike try to convince people that a,

        every interpretation on the land today! I want to see the Name of Jesus and the Revelation of
        God lifted up, mighty and high and exalted! Brother, this is the Greatest Thing that’s ever come
        to man, what we’re hearing here! It’s not man, It’s the Lord! It’s the Lord of Glory, It’s the
        Bridegroom! All my heart’s desire is, the only thing I know of, I would to God, He’d give me a

        I’m just made up that way, I can’t, I don’t have Bro. Branham’s ministry where I can go along
        and say, “Now, the blessed holy Trinity, and this, see, I can’t. I’d hit, I’d lay the axe to the root
        of the tree, and if it fell on everyone and you laughed, I’d tell it anyway. I’m just that way.
         And, I long to see this Revelation triumph over the devil. Why, the devil is just kicking the
        people around and they’re bound and they’ve got so many cults and “isms.” To me, I love Bro.
        Branham, I love his Message. I want to see It live! And, I believe the only way It can live is God
        vindicate and prove It! Oh, I would God would lay upon our heart to do something, that God

        order to reveal the Word, than prophets. But the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by
        the Word. And, remember, the THIRD PULL WAS THE OPENING OF THEM SEVEN

        64-0621 - The Trial
        William Marrion Branham
        143 Now still they won’t believe it. Jesus promised that, “As it was in the days of Noah, and as it
        was in the days of Lot, it would be in the last day.” We’ve got it. It’s here. It’s already
        vindicated, just how many Scriptures! In the Sodom age, what happened to Abraham, would
        return back again to Abraham’s royal Seed, which is in Christ; CHRIST RETURNING IN
        THE FORM OF THE WORD, working in human beings, and showing the signs that He
        promised it would sign, it would do. He promised that He would do it. God promised it. And God
        will keep His promise. 144 And now, a few years ago, I told you that He spoke to me and said,
        “THERE WOULD BE THREE STAGES OF THIS MINISTRY. And one of them would be by
        taking the people by the hand, and would know what their troubles was.” How many remembers
        that? Sure. Did not I tell you, “If I’d be sincere,” that He told me, “it would come to pass that I
        would know even the secret that was in their heart”? Did I tell you that? How many remembers
        that? Did it happen? It never happened the next day, it was years later, but it happened. 145
        AND HE SPOKE DOWN ON THE RIVER, HE SAID, “AS JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS
        SENT FORTH TO PROCLAIM THE COMING OF CHRIST, AT THE END OF HIS
        MINISTRY, JESUS CAME. AND AS JOHN WAS SENT, SO WILL YOUR MINISTRY
        FORERUN THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.” And there’s been a universal revival
        amongst the people of God, throughout the world, in the last fifteen years; the longest revival.
        Any historian knows that no revival lasts over three years. And this is fifteen years. And look at
        the church today, it’s cooled off. WE’RE WAITING FOR HIS COMING. He is a vindicating
        Himself, showing. 146 Now, all these things has happened. He promised in there, that, “You’d
        know the secret of the heart.” 147 NOW THE THIRD STAGE IS JUST BREAKING IN IN
        THE MINISTRY NOW. I won’t take time to go in there, ’cause I think I oughtn’t. But many of
        you here know about it, see, of what’s taken place.
         And, I, I said, “Lord, if, you’d give me a tent, I’ll preach seven days a week, and three times a
        day.” I tell you to come here and preach every week, it’s killing me. It just… My wife said, “I
        don’t know what I’m going to do with you, if something don’t happen.” See, I’m weary. I come
        and you just hear me over and over again, I die every week.
         And, we’ve heard Revelation month after month, after month and year after year, and hours
        and hours and hours and then those poor little old people in Trinidad, all over the country. If God
        would step in and back up this Revelation and put It out there, I tell you, children, it would turn
        the thing upside down and around and around. One message that I preach here will tear every
        interpretation up that’s on the field today.
         There ain’t no preacher, nowhere, can stand before this Revelation from God. And here we’ve
        got this hemmed up with these four walls here. Oh, how we need to pray and cry out to God,
        “God, do something!” How many is going to pray more and ask God? Please do it, won’t ya? I
        sure, I sure need your prayers.
        
        74
         We can see with all our hearts that the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is none other than the Seal
        of God! And, the Seal of God, you think, you add to your Seal of God? Add to your Seal of God
        nine fruits? In other words, the seal means you put the lid on, seals it up. All them Virtues, all
        them fruits sealed in. And, the preachers are saying, “You receive the Seal of God at the bottom
        of the pyramid, and then you put the fruit in the jar.” Like an old woman down in Tennessee
        canning peaches. She goes there and gets the old jar out of the basket, you know, and comes in,
        drops it in the boiling water, that’s sanctification, she finds the jar, that’s justification. She comes
        in boils the water, that’s sanctification, she sets it over on the table, and don’t you touch it, it will
        burn your fingers. Then you know what she’s got on the kettle is the peaches. The glass is all
        sterilized, she comes and puts all them big, nice peaches in there, fills it up to the top. Then she
        reaches over after she’s got all the fruit in it, gets the lids, put it on there, screws her down tight
        in a compact, and seals it. But you can see all that beautiful fruit in there.
         Now, what they are saying is, “You receive the Seal here, God Seals you here.” That’s saying
        the little woman that canned the peaches, mother, she sanctified the jar, justified it and sanctified
        it, set it over on the table and said, “Well, we’ll seal it up now.” Peaches stayed on the stove, and
        she sealed up the jars, and said, “That’s it.” Goes and sets all them empty jars in the cupboard
        with a seal on it.
         And, you know what they’d stay in the cupboard, because nobody want to take them out, ain’t
        nothing in it! I use a little silly illustration, but that goes to show you how unspiritual, and how
        unscriptural the things people are saying. In other words, add to your Seal of God, after you are
        Sealed up, add it to the jar. Well, if you are already Sealed up, how’s he going to get it in you?
        You’re already Sealed until the Day of your Redemption. Bro. Branham said, “When you receive
        the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, honey, you’ve got Everything in you, you need until the
        Resurrection sets in!” I don’t need nothing but That! How many, that’s all you need?
         Now, what you’re hearing, what you’re hearing is Good, White Apostolic Doctrine. You
        know what the people need? They need a tent setting out here in the United States with a
        vindicated ministry in it, and a… and a Apostolic Doctrine out there preached every day! Grind
        the error out of this thing. Get them back to the Truth of God’s Word, so we can show the people
        what a real Bride is. How many believe God’s gonna do it? I believe it with all my heart,
        somehow, it, may not be in a tent, I don’t know. God ain’t showed me no tent! But I say, one
        thing, I don’t know how God is going to do it any other way. Because, you’ll never get in the
        churches, I’ll guarantee you that!
         But I tell you one thing, that’ll break down…I want to tell you something, people are getting
        fed up with all these interpretations of “Bro. Branham going to raise Easter, God’s going to raise
        him three months, and God’s going to raise him next year, and God’s gonna raise him three
        years. He’s gone six years, we don’t know when he’s gonna be back, but he’s coming.”
         I’ll tell you when he’s coming. He’s coming when this ministry goes out on the field, brother,
        and a real strong Baptism of the Holy Ghost is gonna suck the dead out of the graves. Don’t you
        talk about resurrection, until you talk about the Power of the Holy Ghost.

        59-1217 - What Was The Holy Ghost Given For?
        William Marrion Branham
        50 Same Holy Spirit that saved the Lutherans; that sanctified the Methodists; that baptized the
        Pentecostals; is now setting in order the Coming of the Lord Jesus. WHEN, IT’LL BE SO
        POWERFUL, THAT BODY, WILL COME INTO THIS GROUP, A CHURCH, THAT’LL
        DRAW THE REST OF THEM FROM THE GRAVE. There’ll be a resurrection. That’s what
        the Holy Ghost is for. What is the Holy Ghost? “Without us they cannot be made perfect.”
        They lived in one day, under that. We live in another day. “When the enemy comes in like a
        flood, I’ll…the Spirit of God will raise a standard against it.” See? We’re in a day now…
         The Holy Ghost Baptism is the Resurrection, and don’t forget that. There’ll be no resurrection
        of Bro. Branham until the Bride gets the Baptism of the Holy Ghost! God, one day, this Gospel
        will have the preeminence, don’t have it right now, but it’s going to get it in the end. And, God
        give me strength and grace to wait for that hour, that’s all I can say.

        revelation after revelation, and power after power, after power, and glory after glory. We ought

        56-0527 - At Kadesh-Barnea
        William Marrion Branham
        121 The Kadesh-barnea come to the place where there had to be a judgment. And Moses chose
        twelve, one out of each tribe, and he sent them over to spy out the land. 122 When they come
        back, I wish you would notice what a report! “Oh,” they said, “it’s a goodly land. Oh, it’s a
        wonderful land. It’s flowing with milk and honey.” 123 “But,” ten of them said, “we can’t take
        it. We can’t take it. Oh,” said, “we met the—the Amorites, the Midianites, and—and the
        Canaanites, and all that. Why, we looked like grasshoppers, aside of them. They are great big
        fellows. And their cities are all walled in, and there’s no way for us to ever get in. Oh, our hearts
        are fainting within us. We can’t take it.” And, the popular vote of the people, the people received
        it. 124 But there stood two there, one named Caleb, and one named Joshua, who brought back
        a cluster of grapes, that two men had to pack it. Caleb said, “Quieten yourselves, before the
        prophet. Quieten yourself.” [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit four times—Ed.] He said,
        “We are well able to take it. Let’s go get it, immediately!” 125 What we need in this hour is a
        man to challenge the promise of God before the people. GOD PROMISED THE POURING
        OUT OF THE PENTECOSTAL BLESSING IN THE LAST DAYS, I MEAN A REAL
        PENTECOSTAL POUR OUT, AND IT’S TIME FOR IT TO COME. Another Kadesh-barnea
        has arrived. Yes, sir. 126 They said, “We can well do it. Sure, we can do it.” What was it? Those
        cowardly church members was looking to what they could see with their eyes, but Caleb and
        Joshua was looking to God’s promise. I don’t care how much opposition they had, how big the
        giants looked, how big the fences looked, they were looking to God’s promise. 127 AND EVERY
        A MAN AND WOMAN TONIGHT, THAT WANTS TO GO ON WITH GOD, DON’T PAY
        ANY ATTENTION WHAT THE WORLD SAYS, WHETHER WE CAN OR WHETHER WE
        CAN’T; GOD PROMISED IT, AND THAT SETTLES IT. “GOD SAID SO!” I like that. When
        God says so, that settles it forever. 128 I tell you, tonight. We’ve had a whole lot of false
        pretense. We’ve had a lot of make-up belief. We’ve had a lot of stuff that went on for a show.
        Certainly. The devil always throws his forerunners at you, as a counterfeit to scare the people.
        
        78
        We’ve had a false Pentecost. We’ve had a false rain. We’ve had a false this and that. 129 But in
        the midst of every bit of it, there’s a genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit. There’s a genuine
        pentecostal blessing, again. There’s a genuine Divine healing. There’s a genuine Spirit.
        There’s a genuine people. And it’s time for the march. That’s right. 130 The people, at the
        hour of decision now! You’ve got to make up your mind. This church has got to make up its
        mind. Every man comes to a place where there’s a crucial hour. There was a crucial time come
        where you had to make up your mind. A judgment seat, you was at. You had to say, “I am
        guilty,” or, “I am not guilty.” When you’re standing before the judge, you’ve got to make up
        your mind. 131 And, tonight, THE BRANHAM TABERNACLE HAS GOT TO MAKE UP ITS
        MIND. We’re either going to go on or go back. That’s right. You’re going back to garlic
        and—and leek, and stuff of Egypt, or you’re going on to Angels’ food, to the promised land
        where God made a promise. WE’RE GOING ON TO AN OLD-FASHION, HOLY GHOST
        REVIVAL; OR YOU’LL BE WISH-WASHY, PACKING AROUND, AND PECKING LIKE A
        ROBIN ON AN APPLE, UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE. You’ve got to make your decision. You
        can’t go on. “Why halt ye between two opinions?” said Elijah. “God be God, serve Him. If He’s
        not God, then don’t serve Him.” 132 If the real experience of God is what takes the sin out of a
        man’s heart, and not belonging to a church, or belonging to a clan, or belonging to an
        organization, which I have nothing to say against. Those things are all right. If…
         Don’t you wish He’d come tonight? Don’t you wish the “Sound,” such a Sound from Heaven
        would come in here like a Rushing Mighty Wind and paralyze you right where you are setting,
        and, a lick of Fire set upon your old carcass there and burn out everything in it that’s contrary to
        God? And, you’d come out of here sterilized by God, filled with the Holy Ghost? How many
        would like to get sterilized? I appreciate sanctification, but I like sterilization. You know, there
        ain’t nothing that will sterilize you like Fire! Holy Ghost Fire! A lick of It set upon each one of
        our heads, and just sit up there for about an hour and a half and just burn us out.
        Acts 2:1-4-Reference quote:
        1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
        2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the
        house where they were sitting.
        3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
        4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the
        Spirit gave them utterance.
         You know, I don’t think God did a quick operation in the Upper Room. I don’t believe that
        was a “quickie” operation at all! I believe He paralyzed them right where they were sitting. You
        know, that’s the way He’s going to catch you here sometime. The Pastor is going to keep telling
        you that, and one day, you’re going to waddle in here for your last time. And, while, your mortal
        carcass sets down God all at once – (Bro. Bob claps his hands) – a “Sound” from Heaven!
        Whoosh, a Rushing Mighty Wind, and It paralyzes you right where you’re sitting and you can’t
        even move. I dare you; you can’t even move out of your seat. He’ll paralyze you, till you can’t
        even move your hand, and all you can do is maybe just look, a little bit with your eyes and you’ll
        
        79
        look over and you’ll see that lick of Fire setting on your brother and sister, and you’ll see them
        just go out! Wilt like a rose in the sun. And, God will just sterilize you Fill them with the Holy
        Ghost.
         And, maybe hours later you’ll come to, you’ll be a bunch of drunk people and you’ll realize
        that you’re really back in the assembly, and what was promised has happened. And, you’ll be so
        overwhelmed, you’ll stagger out that door, and Durham will know about it. Do you believe?
        Let’s have Faith in God. Time has run out, children. It’s 1971 coming up to ‘72. What if It don’t
        come for another year? You reckon it’s wrong? (Congregation shouts, “No!”) He said, He would
        come though, didn’t He? I believe He wants…I believe he wants to come more than we want
        Him to come. I believe He wants to give us what they had on the Day of Pentecost more than we
        want It. Don’t you? Because He wants us to out carry out His Ministry.
         How many would like to see His Ministry carried out? (Amen) If God would send me out on
        the field, I’d have to take every one of you with me. I’d have to take every one of you with me.
        It’d be like Ben Bryant; I’d have to tie a sheet on the front row and set you all up there.
         Well, I don’t know whether God will ever do that, but I know He’s going to do It, how He’s
        going to do It, He hasn’t told me. Maybe I don’t haven’t any right to know, but I sure wish He’d
        maybe tell me, tell me how He’s going to do it, encourage me a little bit. I tell you something
        that encouraged me greatly, was when I went to Colorado last year. And, old Mark laughed
        about that, boy, I come out of that old bunk about 3 o’clock in the morning. God showed me
        what happened on the Day of Pentecost. I preached It, and I kind of had a Revelation of what
        something it was like, of what it really was. But what God showed me in Colorado, it just
        changed me, really changed my thinking. It really, I come back, I said, “I don’t know how a man
        could stand what happened on the Day of Pentecost, unless he has That.” (Pointing to Stature of
        a perfect man) Such an awesome, fearfullest, “terriblest” thing that ever could happen to a
        person. It’s not nothing that you could jump up and kick your heels. It’s the most awesomest,
        Power, children, that you know the Power of God, you can’t jump up and shout about It. You can
        get happy about It, when the anointing starts, the Power gets down to a light anointing, but the
        Power of God just pulverizes you! You can’t say nothing, and all you can do, It just paralyzes
        you. And, that’s what I believe God did in the Upper Room. He… the “Sound” from Heaven was
        such an overwhelming, super, super anointing that It paralyzed the people right where they were
        sitting. That’s why God caught them sitting.
         So, He could do the Thing, and they wouldn’t jump up and get all excited, and start kicking
        over chairs, and everything. See, overwhelmed them with His Power. Overwhelmed them with
        His Power, and then He operated on them and sterilized them, and climbed right down on the
        inside. Ain’t that wonderful? See, in that day, in That Day, you won’t say, “Now Heavenly
        Father, and you’ll close your eyes, and you’ll hug him right there and you’ll pray to Him right
        down in there. Heavenly Father, I know you’re down in there, and, Lord, I (Bro. Lambert makes
        a kissing sound) …that’s right, it’ll be that Real to you! You’ll know He’s down there, and, see,
        now, if you’re spiritual you’ll catch something right there.
         People holler about, “Oh, oh, something is gonna happen and God’s gonna reveal Seven
        Thunders, and It’s going to give us Rapturing grace.”

        74 And at the end of the Pentecostal age, we are supposed to receive, according to the Word,
        as God help me tonight to show you, through here, THAT WE ARE TO SEE, RECEIVE A
        MESSENGER THAT WILL TAKE ALL THOSE LOOSE ENDS OUT THERE AND
        REVEAL THE WHOLE SECRET OF GOD, FOR THE RAPTURING OF THE CHURCH.
        75 AND THEN THERE IS COMING FORTH SEVEN MYSTERIOUS THUNDERS THAT’S
        NOT EVEN WRITTEN AT ALL. THAT’S RIGHT. AND I BELIEVE THAT, THROUGH
        THOSE SEVEN THUNDERS, WILL BE REVEALED IN THE LAST DAYS IN ORDER TO
        GET THE BRIDE TOGETHER FOR RAPTURING FAITH. Because, what we got right now,
        we—we wouldn’t be able to do it. There is something. We’ve got to step farther. We, we can’t
        have enough faith for Divine healing, hardly. We’ve got to have enough faith to be changed,
        in a moment, and be swept up out of this earth. And we’ll find that, after a while, the Lord
        willing, find where It’s written.

        But, this Angel brings the next announcement. And an angel means a “messenger.” And He
        comes down from Heaven, clothed in that Pillar of Light, Cloud, with a rainbow over His
        head. And a rainbow is a covenant. It was Christ, “With one foot on land, and one on the sea,
        and swore, that, ‘Time will be no more.’” Where are we at, sirs? What’s all this about? I’m
        asking you. 367 The other angels was messengers, men of the earth. But this Angel…These, that
        said, “To the angel of the church of Laodicea,” “To the angel of the church of Ephesus,”
        messengers of the earth; see, men, messengers, prophets, and so forth, to the church. 368 But,
        this One didn’t come from the earth. He come down from Heaven, because the mystery is all
        finished. And when the mystery is finished, the Angel said, “Time shall be no more,” and Seven
        Thunders throwed their voices out. 369 WHAT IF IT IS SOMETHING TO LET US KNOW
        HOW TO ENTER INTO THE RAPTURING FAITH? Is it? Will we run, leap over walls? And
        is there something fixing to happen, and these old, marred, vile bodies are going to be
        changed? Can I live to see it, O Lord? Is it so close that I’ll see it? Is this the generation? Sirs,
        my brethren, what time is it? Where are we at?
         I want to tell you something, them Seven Thunders that people are looking for, great Thing is
        so Simple, when they hear them, they won’t even believe them! Rapturing Grace, Rapturing
        Faith is so simple, It’s so simple, IT’S NIGH YOU RIGHT NOW, NIGH YOU RIGHT NOW!
         You know, how could you ever doubt going in the Rapture if you had what I’m talking about
        right in there? How could you doubt It, when He’s right there? See, the reason people doubt It,
        He ain’t right in there. You know, if I say down there, how many here…how many here would
        believe if Bro. Branham was here and the Rapture took place tonight, that Bro. Branham would
        
        81
        go in the Rapture? Boy, everybody’s hand goes up. Why? Now I’d say, how many believe that if
        the Rapture takes place tonight, you’d go? No hands went up. But, honey, if you was carrying
        around in you, what Bro. Branham carried around in him, you’d raise your hand, too!

        79 And I believe we’re on the border land tonight. I was wondering about all my meetings and
        things, how I had to cancel them out. I truly believe, before the Church can have the Rapture, it’s
        got to have rapturing faith. WE CAN’T EVEN HAVE FAITH FOR DIVINE HEALING, LET
        ALONE RAPTURING FAITH. Got to have a faith that’ll change and quicken this body, and
        be taken away. I BELIEVE THERE’S A CHURCH ON ITS ROAD TONIGHT, A POWER
        OF THE LIVING GOD, THAT MEN WILL SPEAK THE WORD HERE AND THERE, AND
        IT’LL FLASH LIKE LIGHTNING. And a Church is coming out; not a psychologist, not some
        of this put-on, make-belief; but a real, true, genuine, anointed, Holy Ghost, called-out Church!
        Amen.
         Because He’s not up there, He’s right here. And, when He goes back up there, He’s got to
        take this with Him, because He’s right in there. And, I say for us, not to rest day or night, until
        we get Him right down there like he had Him. How many want Him down there, just like that?
        “In that Day, you’ll know that I’m in the Father, and the Father is in Me, and I am in you,” and
        when I’m in there, the works that I did back there, I’ll do in you also, because it won’t be you
        doing the works, I’ll be in there, and I’ll be doing them in first person!
        John 14:20-Reference quote:
        20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.

        12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also;

         If they deliver you up to the World Council of Churches, don’t worry, don’t fret, don’t even
        think about what you’ll say, because when you get before the judge, the old deacon, or whatever
        he is, said, “I’ll give you a Word to say.”
        Matthew 10:19-20-Reference quote:
        19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be

         And, He said, “And when I speak it won’t be you speaking, but it will be the Holy Ghost in

        say, it’s more than a tongue, I say that it’s more than a gift of prophecy, I say, It’s “Christ in you,
        the Hope of glory!” Let’s bow our heads. While our sisters come- (to piano & organ).
         Children, we talk about It now. Noah talked about It a long time, too. God promised that
        everyone Who’s Name is in the Book shall be delivered.
         For in Zion there shall be Deliverance in the Last days.

         We sit here devoid of the Power of God tonight. We sit here hungering and thirsting for the
        Lord Jesus to come and fulfill His Promise, but, we’re right on time. Before He can come,
        there’s got to be somebody looking for Him.
         The Bible says, “Those that are looking for His second appearing shall He appear the second
        time without sin unto salvation.”
        Hebrews 9:28-Reference quote:
        28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he
        appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
         Let us pray. How many want that Lord Jesus down in you more than anything else in the
        world? How many believe He’s worth forsaking everything in the world? You’ll live for
        Eternity! When you receive That what I’m talking about in you, children, you will be an Eternal
        creature. You no more can die no more than God can. You are Eternal! You’ll never die! You’ll
        never die! You’ll live for Eternity. There’ll be no tomorrow! It’ll always be present tense.
        Eternity! And, to think that time is running out. We’re right up here tonight gathered together
        around the Promised Word of God.
         Dear Heavenly Father, Lord, Your Word is so precious to our hearts. We get to talking about
        Your Precious Word, Lord, time, we just forget about time. Lord, we talked about this a long
        time, and now we stood our post of duty again today, but Lord we’re weary of this journey, Lord.
        We want to leave here, God. Lord, You know when You’re coming, you know the right time,
        but, oh, Father, how we pray that, that time is close at hand when you’ll do the thing that You
        promised. We want to go Home to be with thee, Lord! Oh, God, there’s nothing down here can
        satisfy us, but, You, Lord. Oh, Father, your little children want to carry You around in their
        bosom, Lord. They want to know that You’re in them, Father, with that great Baptism of the
        Holy Ghost. But Father, we’re so thankful that we know that You’re forming Yourself within our
        souls today. We know that You’re in us, Lord, forming Yourself by the Word, Faith, Virtue,
        Knowledge and Temperance and Patience and Godly Kindness. We know, Lord, that Day will
        come when Your great Baptism of Power will come and That Supernatural Life will make what
        You already put in us, will make us live and we’ll be Epistles known and read of all men. God,
        first Person, God, will be tabernacled in the Bride. The Bridegroom coming into the Bride, and
        becoming One with her, The Invisible Union. Father, how we pray that, that day will soon arrive.
        Now, Lord, we’ve had a wonderful time again this Sunday. You’ve blessed us every time that
        
        83
        we’ve ever come into this little building, You’ve blessed us. And, we thank You, Lord, for this
        humble building that You’ve given us, and for these humble people that’s travelled all across the
        country to hear Your precious Word. Father, God, all the people around the country that’s never
        heard this Revelation, don’t realize, Lord, what You’re doing in the earth. They don’t realize that
        You’re revealing the Bible. Overseas and around the world, they know that something is amiss.
        Please, Lord, Please, Lord, let this Revelation triumph over the interpretations. Let the Gospel
        have the Preeminence that It ought to have. Father, God, we pray that You’ll raise up Your little
        ministers. And, God, give us a tent out there and send us out there with the Power of the Holy
        Ghost and anoint this, Revelation. Tear down the walls of Jericho, and may the 3rd Pull go out
        and get the converts of Bro. Branham in his Second Pull, Lord. Lord, let there be a revival break
        out among the Just, Lord. Let there be a short, Powerful, quick demonstration of the Holy Ghost,
        and take your little Bride in the Rapture, Father. For, Lord, we pray and ask it in
        Jesus’ Name. And, Lord, it’s not hard to pray that way, because You promised It, and we’re
        waiting in love for You to keep your Word. In Jesus’ Name. Amen.
         Do you love Him? 329, Start that out brother Shaw my voice is gone. (Congregation sings.
        Praising.) Amen let’s sing 112 maybe we’ll stand to our feet, 112. (Congregation sings, praise)
        Just a chorus now, “I know the Lord will make a way.”
         I guess the hardest thing for a man that’s ever called of God is to wait upon the Lord. It’s real
        easy to run ahead of the Lord, get rid of your death, you know. But it’s hard to know, that God
        called you and give you a Revelation for the Hour that you’re living in, it’s death, to wait. But
        any man that’s ever been called of God, stood in the Presence of God, and stood in His council,
        and heard His Word and perceived it, It’s something about it, you have to wait upon the Lord.
        But we know it’s “Not by might, it’s not by power, but it’s by My Spirit,” sayeth the Lord.
        Zechariah 4:6-Reference quote:
        6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,
        saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
         You know and you love your brethren, and your minster brothern and you want them to see
        the way that you see, you want to have unity with them, but we know that they can only come by
        the Power of the Holy Spirit.
         Because they can withstand you and argue with you and fuss with you, but when Jesus is
        standing there, there’s nobody can withstand the lovely Lord Jesus, because His Power and His
        Anointing, and His Love is just so great, it just melts down the bitterest opposition. And, I desire
        with all my heart to see the Bride, the real true Bride that’s followed Bro. Branham’s Message. I
        desire with all my heart to see them embrace this great Revelation. Not because that I just preach
        it, but, because I know it’s the Bridegroom.

        Let’s bow our heads in a word of prayer.
       Our loving heavenly father we come to you again this morning, to stand our post of duty as
       Christian soldiers here father, in a dying world and a dying people. And Lord God we pray thy
       mercy and thy grace upon us this morning, that thou would bless us with thy word. Thou would
       give us virtue Lord strength, for the remainder part of our journey here upon the earth. Lord we
       pray that our days may be but few more upon this earth Lord, for we long to see thy coming.
       Your feet once again, stand upon the earth upon the mount of olives which will cleave asunder to
       the east and to the west. Heavenly Father, we look forward to that great day Lord, with earnest
       expectations and with sincere hearts we look for thy promise. We look for that great thing, that
       thou hast promised to give us in this hour, even thy self. Lord we pray, that thou would have
       mercy upon the people of this world. For God, they know not their left hand from their right.
       They know not from whine they came from or where they’re going Lord, they know not. And we
       pray that you’ll have mercy upon them God. We pray that all those that have their names written
       in the book, may soon come to the knowledge of the saving power of Jesus Christ. God bless
       every soul here this morning Lord. Bless thy people around the world, that’s called by thy name
       and all of thy preachers thy servants, bless them this morning in this hard hour that we’re living
       in Lord. In Jesus name, amen.
        You may be seated. God, bless you! It certainly is a very rainy morning. We’re looking for
       Gods rain to, to fall upon our earth. We’re so thankful that God sends rain upon the earth. We’re
       looking for him to send rain upon our earth, because we know that we are made out of the earth.
       And that’s what we need this morning is the Harvest Rain, upon our seed to make us produce
       what the Bible said we were to be.
        We’re so thankful that salvation is of the Lord. It’s not in man. It’s not in the denominations,
       it’s not in the seminary’s, it’s not in Education, it’s not in riches. It’s not putting your name upon
       the denominational building, that you maybe going to.
        But it’s being able to see by a divine revelation of the Holy Ghost, that your name is written
       on the Lamb’s book of life! And was put there by God almighty, before the foundation of the
       world. Then to be revealed to us in this last day by the holy spirit, of the opening of the seals of
       the book of Revelation. We can see our names upon the book of life. And then by faith believe
       that, and walk toward the great thing that God has promised to do.

       53 Reminds me of one day, me and my brother was going along, and we seen a—an old turtle.
       And that was the funniest looking thing I ever seen, old terrapin. Don’t know whether you have
       
       2
       them here or not. He…they throw their legs like that, you know, when they’re walking. I said to
       my brother, I said, “Isn’t that a funny looking thing?” He said, “It is.”
       We went up to him. He went, “Swoosh!” Puts me in the mind of some of these people, when
       you really go to preaching the Gospel, they pull right back in their shell. “I belong to the
       Baptist. I belong to the Methodist.” Go on, if your name’s not in heaven, you’ll go to hell too.
       That’s right. Only those who are written in the Lambs Book of Life, by being redeemed, born
       again… Jesus said, “Except a man be born again, he will not enter the Kingdom.” Truly.
       Then you’re born again, you become a new creature, a new creation in Christ. Oh, hallelujah.
       In other words… Don’t get excited about it. “Hallelujah” means “Praise our God.” And I praise
       Him. Amen. 54 Then that old turtle, I looked at him, how funny he looked. He drawed right back
       up. I said, “Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do.” I said, “I’ll make him walk.” I got me a big long
       willow, and I begin to pour it on him. He just laid there. You can’t whip them into it. That’s all
       there is to it. No, they’ll just lay there and sulk. I took him down at the water. I said, “I’ll fix him
       up.” I put him down in the water, and just a few bubbles come up. You can baptize them this
       way, that way, head forwards, anyway you want to. He goes down a dry sinner, comes up a wet
       one. He’s still a sinner. You’re not saved by water. That’s right. I thought, “How can I get that
       old fellow moving.” You can’t argue baptisms and ever get the church to move on. Don’t you
       think that. You can’t do it. 55 I went down and got me a piece of paper, and build a little fire,
       and set the old boy on it. I tell you; he moved then. That’s right. What we need today is a old
       time Holy Ghost, God sent fiery revival. Amen. That’s right. That’ll move them. That’s right.
       Preach the fire where they can’t sit still. True. After while, took the old turtle down there, and
       he caught one and cut its head off. Laying there, and my brother come by, said, “You got a
       turtle?” “Yeah.” Looked down there, started to pick him up. And the old turtle’s mouth laying
       there went, snapped at him. Been laying there about a hour. Said, “I thought you said you killed
       him.” I said, “I separated his head from his body.” Said, “He’s just dead and don’t know it.”
       That’s what’s the matter with a whole lot of people. Dead and don’t know it. That’s right.
       Around them churchanities and so forth. Don’t know what the power of the Holy Ghost
       means. Don’t pay no attention to what science says, and this says, and that says, believe Christ.
       Amen. Oh, my. I feel good. Amen. I do, I feel good. Thank the Lord. 56 Now, let me tell you
       something, friends. Then when Jesus came down to the Jordan to be baptized of John, John saw
       the Spirit of God descending like a dove, went upon Him, He was filled with the Spirit of God,
       then into the wilderness He went to be tempted forty days, came out, and the miracles and signs
       begin to follow Him. The Bible said, “These signs shall follow them that believe.” It’s always,
       signs and wonders follows God’s Church, everywhere, Always has, and always will. You can’t
       never… You can take history wherever you want to. God has sent revivals and revivals; and
       come up, and then they’ll make an organization out of it, and then they can’t stand that, of
       course. Then the first thing you know… There has never been an organization that ever fell that
       rose again. God always moves His people on away from that thing. That’s right. That’s true.
       God’s calling today a people together. I believe that with all my heart, not out of your church,
       but together in heart. Let the churches alone. They’re fine, every one of them. But what we need
       is an old fashion, Saint Paul’s revival, and the Bible Holy Ghost preached in them churches
       with power; straighten up those members again. Amen.
        How blessed we are to be here together this morning and to be free from all the headship of
       denominations, to be independent and to serve God according to his word! And we are looking
       
       3
       for the hour to soon arrive, here in United States of America, that no more will we be able to
       worship the Lord God the way that we want to. In order to worship God, we’ll have to worship
       him in the confederation of churches or we will not be able to worship at all. Then those that are
       really born again and called by his name, and in that day, they’ll prove whether or not they really
       believe.
        Because the great man of God has said in this last day, “Your hide will be for-sale. It’ll be
       for-sale!” Let’s not forget to remember these things, that the prophet of God stood upon the earth
       in the last day said, “It would come to pass that when God’s minister would offer prayer up for
       the sick and be shot on the spot. Then you could be shipped to Alaska without even a trial. Just
       pick you up at your house, and transport you straight there without even a trial and be put in
       prison. But those will be blessed days, I’m sure. When they begin to persecute and press the
       children of God in all the ages, you find that’s where God almighty came on the scene and
       delivered his people.

       16 And they’re going to bring a persecution on, pretty soon, and shut up all the churches. You
       see that. And churches like this, who is not denomination, they’ll use them for a storehouse,
       anything. And if any man goes and offer a prayer for anybody else that don’t belong to the
       economical movement, will be shot on the spot. It’s all ready. That Lutheran minister, the head
       of it, said so. And it’s right here, you can read it right here in your magazine. Right. 417 Don’t
       make any difference what they say, that Church will stand true in the fight. She’s already proved
       it back yonder, and She’ll do it again in the face of everything. It’s the Word of God. And let all
       ecumenical movements and anything else be gone. She is going to be There without spot or
       wrinkle. That’s right. She’ll stand there. 418 Notice, God manifested Himself in His body, Christ.
       Now you see the threefold, beautiful thing? 419 Christ in His Body, the Church, vindicating His
       promised Word, like God did through Christ. 420 “Who can condemn Me of sin? If I do not the
       works of the Father, then where have I—where have I failed? Now you fellows say that you are
       doing it, you denomination now, now show Me. Yeah. Show Me where I fail to be the Messiah.
       Show where I failed of, on one sign that God said the Messiah would do, that I haven’t fulfilled
       it,” He said. See? God in His body. 421 Now Christ, “The works that I do shall you do also.”
       See, see, the same God. See? “The works that I do shall you do also; more than this, for I go
       unto My Father,” the Church will be a little longer in Light, see. Vindicating His promised
       Word. As God did His promises in Christ’s body, so is Christ doing His same works in Christ’s
       Body, the Church, see, now making His mystery known to His Bride Tree in the last day,
       
       4
       bringing forth the fruits that was in the Tree at the beginning.
        And we know all these things are working together for good, to them that love God and that
       are called according to his purpose. I think the church of Jesus Christ today that’s called by his
       name, need the persecution more than anything else that I know of. That’s what we need, we
       need persecution.
        I remember it said back in the old days, down in Shreveport Louisiana when God poured his
       spirit out in Louisiana. Why, they used to gather together in those old buildings. And one night
       they was gathered together and worshipping the Lord in praying in all night prayer meetings and
       people repenting and finding God and making restitution. They was really having a revival and it
       upset all the neighborhood and of course, it upset all the denominational churches, you know.
       And one night as they were ministering the word of God and shouting over the good things of
       God. The devil got a hold of one his children and they we’re threating if they met again in the
       building, they would do them bodily harm. So, they shot a gun into the windows, and one of the
       ole saints had her hands up in the air praising God and rejoicing, and the ole bullet hit her ole
       apron you know and the bullet fell to the floor. The bullet wouldn’t even penetrate the dress. So,
       you know those things does us good when you think about it. So, we’re looking for those days to
       arrive again and it won’t be long. It could be, that’s what is the little lull before the storm.
        We see God has revealed his word and his people are making themselves ready, they’re being
       washed by the bleeding word of God and their overcoming. Their looking more like the Lord,
       they’re striving to enter into the great promise of God.
        We wonder sometimes, “Lord, why terri'est thou, why don’t you come soon?” But God know
       the right time the right season. Could be he’s waiting for this world council of churches to kinda
       get together a little more. It seems we don’t read much about them. But we know it takes the
       dynamics to strike their mechanic’s, then they’ll swing together.
        So, I think it’s a little lull before the storm and we’re waiting. God gives us time for each one
       and he knows who’s ready and who isn’t ready. And we know that he can’t come until you’re
       ready! We’ve got to be ready, you’ve got to have Christ on the inside! And that isn’t done
       necessarily over night! It takes a working out of your salvation. And it’s everyone’s
       responsibility in this little store front building here, your responsibility. God’s not gonna do all of
       it for you, he expects you to yield your life to him so that he might do it. He’ll do it, but you’ve
       got to yield your life to him, for him to do it. And we have this space of time possibly, so that
       God might give you time to work out your salvation. Because you’d be in a sad state, if God
       would this morning pour out his spirit, like he did on the day of Pentecost and if you wasn’t
       ready, what good would it do you? You must be ready! So, every one of us has a spiritual moral
       responsibility to God, to overcome the things in our life that’s not in accordance to Gods word.
       We’re under obligation by God, to see to that these things are overcome in our life. The minister
       is obligated in a moral spiritual stand point, he’s obligated to see that his life fits the word of
       God.
        I wonder across the country this morning, if all the great ministers that’s entered into the great
       pulpits across United States by the hundreds of thousands of the denominational churches and
       the independent groups…I wonder how many ministers are going to the pulpit this morning, that
       really believe from their heart what their preaching? I wonder if the statistics of God was written
       upon the wall of how many we’re really sincere in what they we’re saying and how many really
       believe what they we’re saying? I wonder how many would it really be? Then if the ministers
       
       5
       isn’t what he ought to be by the word of God, then what kind of a condition would Jesus Christ
       find each congregation in?
        You know it’s one thing to say you’re a Christian, but it’s another thing to be a Christian.
       Many can profess to be a Christian and say, “I am a Christian” But the word Christian means to
       be like Christ. And to be like Christ, you’d have to accept Gods provided way to be like Christ.
       You just can’t say, “I wanna be like Christ, or I’m a Christian” But to be able to be a Christian,
       that’s something else. And I’m sure if the statistics we’re written upon the wall and you went
       across the country to find that really genuine born-again child of God…Let me tell you
       something, if you could count them on your hands or on your toes probably. For we know in this
       hour we’re living in, it’s a profession without a possession.
        And that’s what wrong with this generation we’re living in, the so-called churches…I don’t
       like to call them churches because they’re not!
        See, when we get down to truth well, what is truth? Well that’s something else! Well, that
       is a racking hard thing to take, Truth! Many say they want, truth! But those that say they want
       truth, but when truth is presented to them, they find it’s too difficult for them. So, they begin to
       make excuses. But when you really get down to what truth is, then it’s a hard thing to except and
       it takes a real genuine God called person to except truth. And that’s what we’re gathered around
       here this morning, is truth!
        We are a people called that are called by his name and we want reality! We want to know
       Christ, in reality to know with a revelation of the power of God, that he is REAL! We want him
       to manifest himself, to speak to us, lead us and guide us! We want his spirit, we want his power,
       we want his deliverance upon us.
        People are more sick today than they ever was. We got greater hospitals, greater doctors and
       all kinds of things, but people are more sick, more sickness on every hand.
        Which reminds me speaking of sickness, we know there’s much sickness among us here. And
       Brother Ruddell’s father had a stroke and is in the hospital. And he’s very dear to my heart, he’s
       a fine Christian gentleman. And I wish you would take it upon your heart, to pray for brother
       Ruddell’s father. That God would heal him and raise him up and not let him die. That he might
       live to see the coming of Jesus Christ back to earth.
        I believe we are the people that can stay alive and never die. Many preachers see the
       revelation of God in his word, about never die. But there is gonna be a people upon the earth
       today, that will never die. That will never have a preacher preach a funeral over them and they’ll
       never go to the casket and down into the grave. They’ll never say, “Dust to dust and ashes to
       ashes.” But they’ll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye. But that’s hard for us to
       believe, that there will be a people upon the earth that will not die.
       1 Corinthians 15:51-52-Reference quote:
       51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
       52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and
       the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

       20 A very beautiful type of today: when the church is hungry, God wants His children fed with
       the Bread of Life, not with some theory, but with the Bread of Life. Who or what is this Bread of
       Life? Jesus said, “I am the Bread of Life that came from God out of heaven.” Said, “Your
       father’s eat manna in the wilderness,” Hebrew—or John 6: they “eat manna in the wilderness
       and they’re every one dead. But I am the Bread of Life that come from God out of heaven. If
       any man eats this Bread, he shall never die.” Or in other words, “I’m the Tree of Life from the
       garden of Eden.” And if they eat of the tree of death, they died. If they eat of the Tree of Life,
       they live. The Holy Spirit guarded the Tree of Life until the Atonement was made, and now the
       Holy Spirit is running the people to the Tree of Life. Adam and Eve was trying to get to the
       Tree of Life. Now their children are trying to stay away from the Tree of Life. The Holy Spirit
       was guarding it; now—now It’s bringing them to It, and they refuse to hear the Holy Spirit’s
       voice, because the same adversary that caused them to sin in the beginning is keeping them away
       from the Tree of Life. And Jesus Christ is the Tree of Life. 21 The woman Eve was the tree of
       death. We all taste of her, being born in this world. And as sure as we’re borned of a woman,
       we’ve got to die. And as sure as we’re borned of the Man, Jesus Christ, we live forever. Yes. If
       you eat that, you’re sure to die. If you eat this, you’re sure to live. Oh, my, I love those glorious
       words which anchors the human soul in a troublesome time like this when nothing else can do it.
       It’s come down till you can’t put confidence in your nation. You can’t put confidence anywhere.
       But “On Christ, the Solid Rock I stand, all other grounds is sinking sands.” Amen.
        But God is in his word, there is no man can rise and say this isn’t Gods word. That it hasn’t
       come to pass because, heavens and earth will pass away but this book will stand forever! God
       will one day judge the world by Jesus Christ who is the word of God. I believe this Bible was in
       heaven, was in heaven and is in heaven and will always be in heaven.
        People use the excuse today and say, “Oh well Mr. Lambert, you know that Bible has been
       translated so many times that you can’t depend on it.” Well, I tell ya! The Bible always was! We
       just didn’t just get to the Bible by the apostles that we call the bible. And the Hebrews calls it the
       Tora, the Hebrew scriptures. But you see, the Bible always was! And the prophet only caught the
       word of God, in the spirit. They caught the word of God… The Bible said, the bible was written
       by men of God, that were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. They wrote the word of God…Men
       wrote the word of God because they we’re moved upon by the Holy Ghost. And they pinned
       down what the Holy Ghost spoke to them. But you see they had to get in the spirit to get the
       word of God. And they got in the spirit to get the word of God and the word of God was always
       there. Because the word of God was God and he always was.
       2 Peter 1:21-Reference quote:
       21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they

       36 But we’re going to jump along now to get the main context out of this. Which, sometime ago, I
       started on this Book of Ruth, and was for three or four weeks, getting through it. Started on the
       Book of Revelation, once, and took all year, about, to go through It. Just every little Scripture
       ties one with the other, entirely, through the Bible. It’s beautiful. Therefore, we know the Bible
       is inspired. For, mathematically and every way, there is no other literature written that what
       will not contradict itself somewhere. 37 This Book was written almost four thousand years
       apart, the Books of the Bible. And they were wrote by some…I forget just how many men
       wrote them. I did remember. But, I’m sorry. I want to say sixty-something, but I—I’m—
       I’m…I may be wrong there. [A brother says, “Forty.”—Ed.] Forty. Forty men wrote the Bible,
       within the space of thousands of years apart, never knowing one another, or seeing one
       another, or reading after one another, many times. And not one word contradicts the other.
       It’s inspired! 38 Now, many people look at this Book of Ruth, as they say, “It’s a love story of
       the Bible.” The Bible is a love story. The whole Bible is a love story. 39 Not only is It a love
       story, but It’s a prophet. Not only is It a prophet, but It’s also a history. Not only is It a—a love
       story, a history, a prophet, It’s God Himself. Because, “In the beginning was the Word, and the
       Word was with God, and the Word was God.” So, the Word is God on print. That ought to settle
       it, brother; God on print. Jehovah, printed on a Book. And there’s none of it just some kind of a
       fiction tale, but it’s all absolutely the Truth. Every phase of It, hang your soul. It’s There. It’s the
       Truth, and God will back His Word up. 40 And this story was written, and all the old
       manuscripts. When they were segregating the Bible, the holy men, when they were trying to put it
       together in the Old Testament, this Book of Ruth was one of the outstanding Books that they
       accepted. Why? If it’s just a love story, why would the writers and ancient sages accept this Book
       as inspired? Because, there’s a hidden revelation in It. And in this hidden revelation, you catch
       the real meaning. It’ll bring you real close to God. 41 And I pray, my whole soul, this morning,
       that God will catch every heart, so spellbound, till He’ll reveal Hisself, just what He is, in this
       story; what He is to you; how to accept Him. And when you once see it, it’s so simple, you
       wonder how you ever went over the top of it. But it can only be revealed by the Holy Spirit. 42
       Now, many, reading the Bible, read It, just stand up and read a page, and read a page. You’ll
       never get It. Because, It’s in riddles. And Jesus thanked God for making It like that. Said,
       “You’ve hid It from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and will reveal It to babes such as will
       learn.”
       
        He never had a beginning or he never had ending of days. He was without mother and he was
       without a father. And he was the word of God and he was called the word of God. And his
       children are the word of God. And they are to manifest and preach the word of God.
       Hebrews 7:3-Reference quote:

        It was like this State Police rolled up here one night, we were in the building kinda late. He
       thought we we’re robbing the place. He rolled up front and said, “What are you doin here?” I
       said, “Well, I’m the pastor of this place here.” The police said, “Oh,” He said kinda a smirkie
       you know. He probably thought what kind of a church could that be, a Durham cleaners, you
       know. And he says a, “What do you preach?” I said, “I preach nothing but the unadulterated
       word of God, that’s found in his Bible. That what we gather here around, is the unadulterated
       word of God, no creed, no creed but Christ and no book but the bible!”
        And you know people, have got their mind made up, of what a church is. They’ve got their
       mind made up! And they got their mind made up, of what a man of God is. He’s a man 6 foot
       four, hair all over his head and wavy. And has just got the kind of a face that all the women love
       to look at. And he just stands with crease’s in his britches that you could shave with. Is, that
       right? And his coat just hangs on him perfect and his shoulders just straight you know. And he
       says his words just perfect and his diction is just right down. He can talk any kind of subject you
       want to talk about. And he just pleases everybody.
        But I tell you one thing! There was never a man that was called of God and that ever pleased
       anybody, but Gods children. Paul said, “If I yet please man, I can’t please God.” And the only
       way that a man of God can serve God, is stay alone away from the people with the word of God.
       And that’s how he serves God, by staying alone and getting the word of God and just bustin the
       peoples hide, just tanning them real good with the word of God. And make out of them what the
       Bible said they ought to be. And brother you don’t get that out of some seminary. You don’t get
       that by education. You get it with tears, cryin, weepin and a prayin and seeking God with all
       your heart. And that’s how you become a man of God.
       Galatians 1:10-Reference quote:
       10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I
       should not be the servant of Christ.
       11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
       12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

       that the Lord has used me, in little special things, to help maybe lay a foundation for a prophet
       that will come. But a prophet doesn’t operate the way I operate. Now, you know that. A prophet
       isn’t an evangelist, and an evangelist isn’t a prophet. A pastor isn’t an evangelist, and an
       evangelist isn’t a pastor. “But God has set in the Church, first apostles, then prophets, then
       teachers, then pastors,” and so forth. God set them in the Church, and God gave them an office.
       65 But, the morning when I laid that cornerstone! Because, now, if you’re spiritual, you get it.
       Because of the cry of the people! If you could break that out, or take the book and read it, it said,
       “Do the work of an evangelist.” Didn’t call me to be an evangelist, but said, “Do the work of an
       evangelist, for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine, but will heap
       
       9
       themselves together, teachers, having itching ears, and shall turn from Truth to fables.” See?
       Quoted that Scripture and told me where to find It. Said it three times. And I got the Bible and
       turned to where He told me, and there it was. And then you know about the two buckets, of the
       Pentecostal Oneness and the Pentecostal Assemblies. I never crossed them. I planted their own
       trees right where they was, ’cause I think they’re both wrong. But, out of it, I was at the cross, at
       the harvest. 66 God respects anybody who is sincere. Peter said that. He perceived that God was
       no respect of persons, all nations calling, when on that house of Cornelius, when they received
       the Holy Ghost like they did at the beginning. See? God is no respect of person. We see a person
       deeply and sincere, he can be sincerely wrong. But if he is sincerely, God will lead him to the
       Light, somewhere. He’ll come to It, ’cause God is obligated to do that. 67 And we think about
       the Coming of the Lord, being such a—a great thing; and the Message, no more than It’s
       went. Remember, there’s a predestinated group to be here when the Lord returns, and it might
       not be over a dozen. See? We don’t know. It might be a hundred million; might be ten thousand.
       But if…The predestinated will hear the Message and believe It, if It’s the Message sent of God,
       which we believe It to be. 68 Now, here we are, then, right up here to the end of the time. When,
       if God did call me…Now, listen, this is not to be repeated. If He did call me to be His prophet,
       then I’m certainly not holding the office of one. Prophets don’t evangelize. A prophet hides
       himself in the wilderness, alone, with God, until he gets exactly, directly what God wants him
       to do. And he stomps right out and gives his Message, and back into the wilderness he goes
       again. He’s not an evangelist, holding meetings, and getting cooperations, and all these things
       like evangelists do. He don’t teach like evangelists. He has THUS SAITH THE LORD, and
       that’s it, and that’s all. He gives it, throws it out, and let the chips fall where it will, and then
       away he goes again. Nobody knows where he’s at. He’s in isolation, somewhere. 69 Now, I
       cannot, or if He’s called me to be that, I cannot be an evangelist. And if He’s called me to be
       evangelist, I cannot be a prophet. Now, you get what I mean? I don’t know what to do. I’ve done,
       reverently, when He told me, first, about me hold the people’s hand and praying for them, then
       know the secret of their heart, all these different things. And, brethren, that’s infallible. You
       know that’s to be the Truth. Every one of you knows that. See? And how He told me It would
       blast across the world, and It’s done it just exactly! Every nation under the heavens has heard
       It, everywhere, newspapers, tape recordings, everywhere. I don’t know how It’s ever done it.
       But, throughout all the world, letters coming in, and people from way down in Thailand, and the
       Hottentots back in there. How those missionaries has crowded back in there with those tapes,
       and giving that interpretation of the Word. And now we hear from all over the world, see, around
       the world. Now, they, the Church, is predestinated universally, everywhere. “Be two in the bed;
       two in the field,” see, take one and leave one. 70 Now, as I have done the work of an evangelist.
       And here is my plea. If that is pleasing to God, and I’ve done the work all right, trusting that I
       have pleased Him, asking forgiveness for all my mistakes, then He may be calling me from the
       field of evangelism, to be His prophet. Then if it is, I’ll leave evangelism. But if He calls me to be
       a prophet, I cannot be an evangelist. If I’m to be evangelist, I cannot be a prophet. I’m mixing
       the two offices. That’s where I’ve always fussed about. Standing on the platform, it’s never
       been good, successful. God has used it, but I’ve never thought it was His direct will. It’s been
       His permissive will. Stand on the platform, a vision or two will knock you out, almost. See? And
       then if you tell this person how to straighten hisself up, and what to do; and then the next person
       stands there, he is expecting the same thing. And you can’t tell him, ’less Something tells you to
       tell him. And then the other people feel like you’re a traitor, or a backslider, or—or a demon or
       something, because you don’t tell them what they want to know. See, that’s not the office, the
       
       10
       way a prophet operates. 71 A prophet stays back here till he stomps right into the hospital, or
       wherever he’s going, with THUS SAITH THE LORD, and say it, and stomp back out again.
       He’s no evangelist, at all. He don’t hold meetings and discuss things. He’s got the Word of the
       Lord for whoever he’s sent to. 72 If he’s sent to the White House, he stomps right up in front of
       the White House, says, “THUS SAITH THE LORD.” If it’s to the governor of the state, whoever
       it is, it’s THUS SAITH THE LORD. He don’t fool around with a group of churches, trying get
       them to come in and take the Word, and preach these things like evangelists. He’s not an
       evangelist. 73 So, you see, brethren, that’s the reason I don’t call myself a prophet. I’m not even
       in the office of one. See? Now you understand what I mean?
        And then you’ll tell the people the truth! And you know even Gods children even at first,
       don’t want to hear the truth because they know it’s gonna cost them something. But they’re made
       up in such a way, they’ll just yield themselves down to it and forfeit all their wool and just
       become what they ought to be. And that’s how we know we are called by his name, when we
       know that we can take the word of God and then begin to make our lives fit the word of God.
        And that’s why when you go out in the world and they see you that you don’t dress the way
       the world dresses. You don’t follow after the things of the world that they follow after, then you
       become a very peculiar people. And you become a hick and an embarrassment to them. Because,
       you take a real saintly woman of God and she’s around another woman and if she has got any
       honesty in her heart at all…You won’t mention Christ, you won’t mention going to church, you
       won’t mention the Bible and immediately they’ll start talking about God. If they’ll see a woman
       come in, with long hair and no makeup and a dress down over her knees, like the bible said,
       “Women should dress themselves in Modest apparel.” And so help me, they’ll right away be
       convicted and they’ll begin to talk about God and how they’re faithful to their denomination.
       And how they read their Bible. Why is it? How your presence carries an atmosphere about you
       and it convicts them.
       1 Timothy 2:9-Reference quote:
       9 I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not
       with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,
        Jesus said, “You are the light of the world! Ye are the salt of the earth!”
       Matthew 5:14-Reference quote:
       14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
       Matthew 5:13-Reference quote:
       13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it
       is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
        That’s why in an hour when we see women, that’s not women anymore more, that are
       perverted perverse creature that God has upon the earth today is a woman.
        And then in that hour, he has called his little ladies by his name. Baptized in his name! And
       when they walk out there dressed decent and their little faces cleaned and washed and shinning
       with the glory of God. That’s Christ to the people! Your a Bible that they’re reading, they know
       
       11
       even though they don’t live it. There’s somebody somewhere on the earth that’s being a
       testimony to God and living the word of God.
        When I walk in the restaurants with my wife and my little sisters that’s traveling with me
       wherever we go or around about where we live and we go in there. Everybody is eating and
       every one of them turns around and looks at their long dresses and their long hair and begins to
       snicker and laugh. But I feel good down on the inside!
        You know you go in (Department stores) Barkers and you go into Tops you know and you
       walk in the door and there you are on the big television set. Every time your hand moves to pick
       up something the policeman see’s it on television.
        And brother when you walk into a restaurant with your wife and you bow your head and pray
       and ask God to sanctify the food. And all the people looking around laughing at you mocking
       and make'in fun of you, they’re on Gods television set. One day, when that little saint of God,
       that little lady walks up there, dressed like she was on earth there. God will push a button with
       his great finger, and there’ll flash back that great picture that he took, like was on television on
       that day and there’ll be their voices speaking. There’ll be their thoughts and they’ll be their
       words, how they mocked and made fun of them. And they’ll walk up that little saint of God, and
       God will say, “When you laughed at her you laughed at me. Now depart into everlasting fire and
       torment.” “But now here, enter into the joy of the Lord.”
        Jesus said, “If your ashamed of me before man, I’ll be ashamed of you before my father
       which is in heaven”
       Luke 9:26-Reference quote:
       26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be
       ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.
        And any child of God that’s ever come in contact with Jesus Christ, they’re not ashamed of
       the power of God and the gospel of Christ. Any man of God that’s ever-met God, he’ll put his
       bible out in front of him and walk before the president of United States and say, “Repent and be
       baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and receive the gift of the
       Holy Ghost, it’s God’s great gift.”
       Acts 2:38-Reference quote:
       38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
       Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
        I’m thankful to God that I got something in my heart, that I’m not ashamed of Christ. Oh, I
       remember when I used to go to the Baptist Church I was ashamed of him. Oh, I was so glad I’d
       could get to church real quick so nobody would see my bible. I wouldn’t dare'est raise my hand,
       it would embarrass me. Why? Because I was full of all kinds of ole pride.
        You know that’s one of the things that God hates, is pride. You got to get down and get out
       that ole pride out of you and realize that you’re nothing. Where did you come from and where
       are you goin? You’re nothing but the dust of the earth. You’re worth fifty cents, I take that back!
       You’re worth more than fifty cents. Your worth seventy to eighty-five cents, because of
       inflation, money’s lost its value, I want you to know that now worth eighty-five cents. Used to be
       you were worth sixty-five cents or fifty cents, I believe it was in certain chemicals, potash.
       
       12
        As Brother Branham said, you got just enough of a little potash to sprinkle in a hen’s nest. A
       little iodine and a little this and a little that. But your worth more now though about eight-five
       cents, I think they’ve valued you at now eighty-five cents. But you’ve got a soul down in there
       that’s worth millions of worlds.

       down in Memphis, Tennessee… I like art, and I was watching there in the museum where it said
       the analysis of the human body of a man weighing a hundred and fifty pounds was worth eightyfour cents. There’s enough whitewash in the body to sprinkle a hen’s nest, and, oh, you know

        Now I’m very happy to be with you this morning. If you’ll open your bibles now. I was just
       kinda talking a little bit. We don’t get in no hurry here, you know.
        You know I can’t understand, what…I’m gonna have to go to some of these…I haven’t been
       in a denominational building in a long time. Now I don’t like to call them churches, because
       that’s not right see. Every time I say church, something tells me say’s, “Don’t say that.” They’re
       not churches, they’re not churches at all, their lodges. The Bible said they we’re lodges.
       Anything that you join is a lodge. Listen, there’s no more difference than you joining the
       Methodist, God don’t pay no more attention to that no more than going down and joining the
       Elks. Or you go down and join the a… that mysterious one, I don’t know what it is, the one with
       the ring and all those biblical statements that they make. What’s the difference in a Baptist or a
       Methodist or a Mason or an Elk or a moose or whatever it is! Your just as lost honey as lost can

       61-1224 - Sirs, We Would See Jesus
       William Marrion Branham
       244 They lost Him, in their creeds, when they made three gods out of Him, chopped Him to
       pieces and made a idols, instead of knowing who He is. “I and My Father are One.” You lost
       Him. 245 He’s lost, in their religious crowd. How did the religious crowd? He is lost, to His
       church, in the Laodicea. The last church, church age, it said He was on the outside of the
       church, “knocking,” trying to get in. The most pathetic sight in all the Bible, is the condition of
       the church in the last days before He comes. Not another church age ever put Him out. They
       didn’t know any difference. Now when they really know the true power of the Holy Ghost, they
       kicked Him out of the place, on the outside, knocking at the door. “Behold, I stand at the door
       and knock.” Sure. They lost Him, in their commercial crowds. 246 They lost Him, in their
       religious crowds. That’s right. They made creeds out of it. They made denominations out of it.
       They lost it. They took the—they took the ritual instead of the Bible. They took a bunch of men’s
       ideas instead of what God said. They said, “Put your name on the book. Shake hands. That’s all
       you have to do. Be baptized, ‘Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.’” The whole thing is false. That’s
       right. 247 There is where the church crowd lost Him, when they lost Him. Why? Not in their
       
       13
       church buildings, not in their what-you-call-it’s, their—their group of people. But they lost
       Him when they left the Word. “If that…If you abide in Me, and My Word in you, ask what you
       will. It’ll be given to you. It’ll be done for you, if you abide in Me, and My Words abide in you,”
       ’cause it’s God, made flesh again. See? “Ye abide in Me, and My Word in you, then just ask
       what you will. It’ll be done for you.” That’s it. 248 But, today, they’re not abiding. They’re, this
       day, a Methodist, tomorrow a Baptist, next day a Presbyterian, ain’t got nowhere yet.
       
        Except a man be born again, he can NO WISE ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF

       140 “Remember and repent, or I will remove the Light of the star out of his place.” What’s his
       place? In the Church. “But if you don’t repent and go back to where you was at the first place,
       I’ll take your pastor right away from you and move him out of his place; I’ll put him somewhere
       else where his…where I’ll reflect My Light that’ll shine.” Hmm! Wasn’t that solemn? 141 It’s
       time for the churches to repent. It’s time for Pentecost to get a lot of these little polished
       scholars out of the pulpits, and get the old-fashioned preacher in there that’ll tell you the
       Truth; not pat around and use the church for a meal ticket, big wages, and something like
       that, and psychology, and a few horse races, and soup suppers, and everything else. It’s time to
       get back to the Gospel. I don’t care how little you are, “Where two or three are gathered, I’ll—
       I’ll be in their midst.” 142 “Repent, unless I come and remove the candlestick; send him away,
       elsewhere shine his light.”
        Now I read somewhere some great, oh I don’t know some archeologist, mythologist and
       pathologist, it was one of them ologist fellas. He’s got it all figurated out, you know. That the
       Hebrews is really a mythical religion. It’s a myth, nothing to it. He had it all figured out and
       explains it. And I thought, “Isn’t that something, there’s a man that his brain is filled with all
       kinds of things, you know. All kinds…His brain cells are just packed full of all kinds of
       knowledge and ain’t got the sense a horses got. They can explain everything away, see. But then
       God makes a fool out of them with the leaf fallen off the tree and with the little flower. They
       never been able to figure out what makes the one flower yellow and another one brown and
       another one red and another one orange. They can’t figure it out. So, for those that humble
       themselves they’ll know their God.

        Now let’s look in act 2:21, for our scripture reading. And it shall come to pass…Well, let me
       read verse 19.
       Acts 2:19-21-Scripture Reading;
       19 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and
       vapour of smoke:
       20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable
       day of the Lord come:
       21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
        And then for another scripture, let’s open to Romans 10:11. Now I’m gonna preach on
       something that I’ve never preached on before this morning. I never have preached on this
       scripture.
       Romans 10:11-15-Scripture Reading;
       11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
       12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich
       unto all that call upon him.
       13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
       14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe
       in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
       15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of
       them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
        May God add a blessing to his word. And for a subject this morning I’d like to take, “Calling
       upon the Lord to be Saved” And for text, The gospel! Just what is the gospel? What has been the
       gospel? And what is the gospel today?
        Now notice here, that the apostle was saying here in the books of Acts, that when the day will
       come, the day of the Lord will come when the sun will not give its light, the moon will turn to
       blood. There will be blood upon the earth, there’ll be a vapor of smoke and there’ll be fire upon
       the earth. And it said in this terrible day of the Lord, he said it’ll come to pass in that last day
       when these things come to pass, in the day of the Lord.
       Acts 2:19-21-Scripture Reading;
       19 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and
       vapour of smoke:
       20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable
       day of the Lord come:
       21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
        Now this is a day that we’re living in today, is the day of the Lord. Man has had their way for
       six thousand years. God has let man have his way, to rule over the peoples of the earth. And we
       found out that every man that every ruled over the earth was a failure. Every kingdom was a
       failure and ended in sin and decay degradation and God destroyed them. Raised up another
       government and they even got worse than they were. Man has ruled over man for six thousand
       years.
       
       15
        And now we come down through seven church ages, through the last two thousand years
       since the death of Christ and the ending of the apostolic ministry of the twelve apostles. We
       come down to this last day, it’s called the day of the Lord. It’s a day when it’s gonna be the
       Lord’s day, when he’s gonna have his way. When all of his word will be fulfilled and everything,
       that he has spoken of shall come to pass. When man will no more be in the picture but will be
       God in first person making, his word live and come to pass. For all that is written in the book,
       shall come to pass in this day. And we see these things coming to pass before our very eyes.
       Bible prophecies are bein fulfilled very quickly.
        And it said in this last day, in the day of the Lord in the end of this last two thousand years,
       the apostles said it’ll come to pass that who so ever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be
       saved. How many want to be saved? (Amen) We know that we’re living in this day and God has
       to have a provided way, for the people of God to be saved in this hour.

       59-0920 - Planting The Vine And Where To Plant It
       William Marrion Branham
       70 One day, God was determined that He would save His people, His predestinated Church.
       He had to do it, Himself, because He predestinated it before the foundation of the world. 71
       Man is a failure, and always will be. He’s a failure, to start with, and he’ll always be a failure.
       72 God, in His predestination, in His Own great infinite mind, planned the plan to put a real
       Vine down. And He planted on this earth, the Vine, the righteous Vine; not a denomination,
       not a church, not a creed, but a Man, Himself, made flesh. And He manifested His peace, His
       Power, the great Angel of God. The great Jehovah was with Him. And in Him dwelt the fullness
       of the Godhead bodily. And men did not believe Him; and disbelieve Him because He would not
       cooperate with their creed. 73 Finally, they led Him away to Calvary. There that Blood cell was
       broken, of the precious Son of God, the Body in which Jehovah lived. There came forth a Vine,
       with Its roots in Glory, with Its branches on earth, to produce a Church of the living God, that
       would show forth His resurrection and His Power. Who is these men and women that would
       deny that Church, the Vine of the living God? The ever-failing…Presence of the Lord Jesus with
       His Church, to live, and to show forth His predestinated branches, that He caught before the
       foundation of the earth. And swore, by those, that He would raise them up. And His Church,
       today, with the glory of His resurrection living in Her! “I am the Vine; ye are the branches.”
       Every time the heart beats, the blood pulsates to every member of the body. Every time the loyal
       heart of God beats, it pulsates through the Name of Jesus Christ, to the Church, “Whatever you
       ask in My Name, that I will do. I am with you always, even to the end of the world.”
       
        We are under a responsibility; God is under a responsibility to bring his plan of salvation.
       And then when he brings his plan of salvation according to his word, then we are under
       obligation to receive the provided way that God has provided.
        The trouble with man today, they want to pick out their way to be saved. My brother and
       sister this morning, my dear sinner friend you cannot pick out your way to be saved. You must
       accept God’s way of salvation or your lost. Because salvation is of the Lord, it’s not of man. It’s
       not of any denomination, it’s not of intellectual powers. It’s not by might, it’s not by power but
       it’s by my spirit saith the Lord God.

       6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,

        If you want healing, your gonna have to find out the way that God heals. If you want to find
       salvation, you’ve got to find Gods salvation. Because “There is a way that seemeth right unto
       man and that way is death.”
       Proverbs 14:12-Reference quote:
       12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.
        And we know if all of our goodness and all of our righteousness that we have… You could
       give your body to be burned, you could give all your goods to the poor, you could never cuss,
       never smoke, never drink, never commit adultery and be the most righteous man upon the earth.
       BUT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD, YOU ARE DIRTY AND FILTHY AND YOU MUST BE
       CLEANSED BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB!
       Isaiah 64:6-Reference quote:
       6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all
       do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
        There is no other way to be saved then Gods plan of salvation, through the blood. And we
       know that the blood is in the word of God. There is no other way that a man can be saved unless
       he’ll receive the WORD OF GOD! That’s the only way, God’s plan of salvation.

       50 And that’s the way with a real Christian. Did you know a real Christian doesn’t have even
       any sin at all imputed to him? David said, “Blessed is the man who God will not impute sin to.”
       When you’re washed in the Blood of the Lamb (not by make-belief, but really the—the Blood
       of the Lamb), God does not impute to you anything that’s done, because you’re under the
       Blood and He doesn’t see it. There’s a Blood sacrifice; the only thing He can see you in, is the
       way He saw you before the foundation of the world when He put your name in the Lamb’s
       Book of Life. THAT’S ALL HE CAN LOOK AT, BECAUSE YOU ARE REDEEMED FROM
       EVERYTHING THAT WAS EVER DONE, YOU’RE WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF THE
       LAMB. Therefore there’s no gall in you, there’s no unclean habit in you, because that the Blood
       of the Lamb has did this; and God cannot impute sin to you after you’ve got a sin-offering
       laying there waiting for you.

        Notice here the Bible said, that it’ll come to pass in the last days, when all these terrible
       things take place in the earth. That it’ll come to pass that “WHO-SO-EVER SHALL CALL
       UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD shall be saved.” “Who-So-Ever…who-so-ever will, let him
       come and call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.”
        All right now you’ve got to call, Gods ways. You just can’t make any kind of call to God.
       You’ve got to find out how to call upon the name of the Lord. You can’t just call any way. So, if
       the Bible said, “Who-so-ever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” Let us look in
       the Bible and see how we are gonna call upon the name of the Lord to be saved. Notice he’s
       talking about salvation.
        Now what do we have today? A bunch of people around the world professing Christianity by
       the hundreds of millions, supposingly calling upon the name of the Lord.
        The bible said, “Strait and narrow is the way that leadeth to salvation and few there be that
       find it.” “For as it was in the days of Noah when eight souls we’re saved, so shall it also be in the
       second coming of the Son of Man.” “When they we’re eating, and drinking and givin in
       Marriage till the day Noah entered into the ark and knew it not and the flood came and took them
       away. So, shall it be also in the second coming of the Son of Man.”
       Matthew 24:37-Reference quote:
       37 But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the
       days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the
       day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away,
       so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
       Luke 17:26-27-Reference quote: 26And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. 27They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that
       Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
        So, it behooves us brother and sister if we see that “STRAIGHT NARROW THAT
       LEADETH TO LIFE and few there be that find it.” Then it behooves us to be sincere in heart,
       and search out and find the provided way of salvation then!
       Matthew 7:14-Reference quote:
       13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to
       destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
       14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that
       find it.
        “Who-so-ever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” So, if it’s that simple that
       who-so–ever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Then let us look in GODS
       BOOK and see how to call upon the name of the Lord.
        We know that the Bible said, and Jesus Christ spoke these great words. “Call not upon the
       name of the Lord as the heathen do. Don’t, don’t, don’t pray vain repetitions as the heathen do!”
       
       18
       Matthew 6:7-Reference quote:
       7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be
       heard for their much speaking.
       Matthew 6:9-13-Reference quote: But pray;
       Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
       10 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
       11 Give us this day our daily bread.
       12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
       13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the
       power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
        But Pray and call upon the name of the Lord! The only way that you can call upon the name
       of the Lord, is to call according to his word.
        All right, now listen to this! Now notice here the great Apostle Paul in the book of Romans. I
       have never preached on this before, but God blessed my soul when I saw this simple scripture.
       You know, God revelation is so simple you got to have the holy Ghost upon you, to see it. You
       can study all the days of your life! You can memorize the Bible from cover to cover.
        There was an ole colored man that said down south, “I believe it, from kever to kever!” And
       you can believe it from kever to kever and study it from kever to kever and brother memorize it
       all you want to, but until the Holy Ghost comes upon you and REVEALS GODS WORD to you,
       it’ll not benefit you. Oh, it’ll benefit you and make you reform, make you a better person. But
       you’ve got to have a revelation of God’s word to be saved.
        See, if the natural man, if the intellectual man could get God’s revelation, then salvation
       would be of man and of works. “But salvation is not of works least any man should boast, but
       it’s by the Grace of God.”
       Ephesians 2:9-1-Reference quote:
       8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
       9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
       10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before
       ordained that we should walk in them.
        Now listen to this great word of God, through the great Apostle Paul. I believe it’s a
       revelation here this morning.
        All right now, the Bible said in Acts 2:21. That the day will come to pass when all these
       terrible things will be taking place, signs in the heavens, signs in the earth. Do we have signs in
       the heavens or signs in the earth? (Amen) He said, “In that day, the great notable day of the Lord,
       that who-so-ever will call upon the Lord shall be saved.”
        Now notice here, Apostle Paul we believe wrote the book of Romans. And even Apostle Paul
       got ahold of this same scripture that was spoken by the apostle Peter, by the Holy Ghost. Quoted
       by Joel 2:32 said, “Who shall call upon the name of the Lord” This is the same thing that Paul is
       speaking about.
       
       19
       Joel 2:32-Reference quote
       32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered:
       for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the
       remnant whom the Lord shall call.
       Romans 10:12-13-Reference quote:
       12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich
       unto all that call upon him.
       13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
        He said now, “There’s no difference then the Jew or the Greek or whoever it is.” Said, “Who
       shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Paul speaking of this in Romans 10 here,
       11-16. Said, “Who-so-ever shall call upon the name of the Lord.”
        The Apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost in, Acts 2:21 said, “Who-so-ever shall call upon
       the name of Lord in the Last days” You see!
       Acts 2:21-Reference quote: 21And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
        In the last days, when the moon will turn to blood and the sun will get dark. I may preach on
       that one night! How the sun gets dark and how the moon turns to blood.
        Now in that day, “Who-so-ever” that see’s these signs in the heavens and in the earth, like
       your seeing now, see. “Who-so-ever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
        Now listen to what the great Apostle Paul here said now. How shall they call upon him of
       whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without a preacher? All right then, now
       here’s God provided way, just as simple as simple can be.
       Romans 10:14-Reference quote:
       14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe
       in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
        In this last day when the moon is turning to blood and the sun will not give her light and there
       will be signs in the earth and signs in the heavens. And perplexity of nations, famines stress of
       nations, man’s hearts failing for fear. In that day, “Who-so-ever shall call upon the name of the
       Lord shall be saved.”
       Luke 21:25-26-Reference quote:
       25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth
       distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
       26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the
       earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
        And the apostle Paul, “How shall these people in the end time living in this day, how shall
       they call on him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
        Alright now, the first thing that I want to bring out here, that in order for you to find God’s
       plan of salvation, you have got to find the right preacher! Oh, I know a lot of people don’t want
       
       20
       to believe that. I’m not responsible for that, I’m only responsible for God’s word. You’ll either
       find the right preacher honey or you’ll be lost and go to hell.
        “Oh, I believe I can just read the Bible” No! you’ll go right to hell! See! “Heavens and earth
       shall pass away, but the word of God shall never pass away” Is, that right? (Amen)
       Matthew 24:35-Reference quote:
       35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
        And the Bible said. “If OUR GOSPEL BE HID, it’s hid to them that are lost!”
       Corinthians 4:3-Reference quote:
       3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
       4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of
       the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
        “And to the law and to the testimony, if you don’t speak according to this word there is no
       light in them!”
       Isaiah 8:20-Reference quote:
       20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is
       no light in them.
        “And if an angel from heaven come and preach any other gospel then what that God called
       preacher preaches, let him be accursed.”
       Galatians 1:8-Reference quote:
       8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we
       have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
        Oh, the gospels straight! It’s straighter than Castrol oil ever thought of bein. Let me tell you
       something! God’s word said, “How shall they call upon him, of whom they have not heard? And
       how shall they hear without a preacher?
       Romans 10:14-Reference quote:
       14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe
       in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
        All right now, Paul is asking you a question! Paul is asking you a question, if the people are
       goin to be saved in this end-time, how are they gonna be saved until they hear the gospel? And
       how are they gonna hear, without a preacher? He’s asking a question. I think that’s a good
       question, don’t you?
        Notice here, that the people cannot hear Gods plan of salvation without the preacher. Oh, now
       there’s lots of preachers sure! The world is full of preachers, but the world ain’t filled with God
       called preachers. Honey, they’re as scarce as hen’s teeth. Did you ever see a hen have teeth?
       They’re scares as hen’s teeth.

       59-0609 - What Hearest Thou, Elijah?
       William Marrion Branham
       26 Men are afraid to speak; they’re afraid to take a stand. They have to have something behind
       them to back them up, some great denomination, or organization, or some great band. What
       would men… God-called man needs is a Holy Spirit behind him to back him up. You stand
       alone. Today, we won’t do it. We stand as a organization. We stand as a move. We stand as this,
       that, or the other. But God wants men to be individuals, like Elijah was. He was the only one
       left so far as he knew, but he stood for the right principles. Noise and the shakings didn’t
       bother him. He waited till he heard that still small Voice, then he answered. We can have
       gatherings across the country. We can have great stadiums full of people. We can have all kinds
       of things going on. It’ll never help until God speaks individually to the human heart, the only
       thing that’ll change man. It’s the only thing that’ll make him wrap himself over his own face,
       and walk into the Presence of God. The church needs it, friends. That’s the kind of condition we
       want. 27 Someone said some time ago, said, “Brother Branham, the only thing the matter with
       your meetings,” said, “when the Holy Ghost is anointing you and you see visions, we believe you
       then. But oh, that old cold formal preaching you have…” Well, if the Holy Ghost can show
       visions, It’s the same Holy Spirit that speaks otherwise. God will not do it. We need correction.
       Oh, we need to get back, set quiet and listen until something happens within us. A Voice from
       heaven speaks. But we want some kind of a backing up. A man thinks because he become a
       minister, if he don’t go up to some great organization to get them to back him up, well, he will
       not be able to preach. If God called you to preach, preach if you stand alone. Preach anyhow.
       God spoke to you. Stand out there and preach. It’s your God-given right. I’d rather listen to a
       man like that, than have all—one that had all the D.D.’s and Ph.D.’s behind him. That’s
       what’s ruined the church today. It’s went after class, and cults, and societies. Them things are
       all right, but it don’t belong in a house of God. God wants God sent men, anointed from heaven
       that’s heard the story of God and been filled with His Spirit, that stands upon the convictions
       of his heart. 28 Look at Elijah. Look at Elisha that followed him. Look at John the Baptist in
       his day. Look at Paul. All had forsaken him, and he still stood because he had met God. He
       heard a Voice speaking to him one day. Look at John Wesley, Martin Luther, Calvin. Men
       who’s ever done anything for God’s been men who’s heard God and stood on their convictions,
       listened and waited. Don’t make any difference what the rest said, they wait till they hear God.
       The great revivals are going on. It seems like these rushing winds and mighty towers and all this
       going on; they wait. God’s eagles always does, until they can hear that Voice that speaks to
       them. 29 You know, great things don’t make much noise. Did you ever think of that? Why, you
       know, the sun can draw ten million barrels of water with less noise than we can pump a glass full
       out of a pump. Great things usually move silently. Did you ever hear the planets turning around
       one another? No, but how great is it? Did you ever hear the daybreak? And yet it scatters all
       the darkness. And it’s so silent; it don’t even wake us up. But it scatters all the night. What the
       Pentecostal church needs today, is a day breaking, a breaking of day, in that when they’ll
       stand still until God comes into their hearts, scatters the night. We think if the night’s being
       scattered, a little darkness somewhere, we have to tear the city up. We don’t have to tear the
       
       22
       city up, “STAND STILL,” HE SAID, “AND KNOW THAT I’M GOD.” Told Moses, ordered
       him to stand still, “Watch and see what I’ll do.” What we need, brother, we’ve run before the
       cart… before the horse before the cart. 30 Like a messenger one time, run. He heard something;
       he took out running. But when he got there, he had nothing to say when he got there. I think
       that’s a whole lot’s the matter today. We’ve heard a lot of going on; then we took out running.
       Now, we don’t know what we’re running about. Let’s wait till we hear from God, till God
       speaks to the heart, and we got a message, something that that still small Voice has changed
       every fiber of us. If the churches, and the laymen, and the ministers, and the priests tonight,
       would wait upon God in their cave somewhere until that happened, all denominational barriers
       would be broke down, and men would be brothers. Yes. We’re nervous and upset. They’re still
       God’s people. Just like Elijah was God’s people, but he needed a cave experience. 31 Did you
       ever notice, it isn’t a little ripple that reflects the stars, making a lot of noise; it’s the still small
       pool that reflects the stars. And many times, we’ve relied too much on the ripple. I believe the
       ripple’s got water on it. But you know what makes it to ripple? Because it’s shallow. That’s true.
       I remember one time, my dad and I went out into the field to get some food out of the field in a
       wagon. I don’t know how many of you boys here raised on a farm. But we had this old
       buckboard wagon of a thing, and we took out there. And every little bump we hit, it was
       bumppity-bump, crack, boom, bum, bum, jumping up-and-down. And it made the awfulest noise I
       ever heard. But we loaded it just as full of good things off the farm as we could, and come
       right back over them same bumps and never made a bit of noise. It was loaded. 32 What we
       need tonight is a loading, filled with God’s Divine love and power, waiting until that still small
       Voice meets us. In this convention, let’s wait till we hear His Voice. That’s a challenge to us.
       Wait till we know what we’re doing. Wait till His Voice speaks, and then we know which way
       to go. That ought to… It brings convictions to me. Someone says, “Well, now look, Brother
       Branham. You see, if the crowd’s a running, well I… Don’t you think we ought to go with
       them?” “You wait on God.”
        Notice here, you can’t hear, you can’t call upon the name of the Lord as the prophesy said in
       Joel. You can’t call upon the name of the Lord as the apostle said, without a preacher.
        Now what’s the matter with all the people today goin around across the country saying,
       “There’s no more preachers today, the last one come and it’s all over” Then if there’s no
       preacher today then there’s no salvation today. If there’s no preacher today, there’s no God! If
       there’s no God, there’s no resurrection. As long as there’s a bride here brother, there’s a preacher
       somewhere here that’ll tell the truth. How many believe that? (Amen) Notice here, if their gonna
       hear, their gonna have to have a preacher. A God called preacher!

       The principle is God in the people. How could God, being supernatural, being this Man? They
       had never heard of that before. But Jesus was opening a gate, a door to the race of Adam;
       Him being the Son of God. 8 Listen, Jesus, 24th verse, 34th verse, Jesus answered them, “Is it
       not written in your law, I…?” Now here, Hisself, being the Son of God, yet said, “I said.” See
       the personal pronoun in it? “I said, Ye are gods. Ye yourself are gods. Is it written in your law,
       
       23
       that I said, Ye are gods? If He…” Back to God again. They couldn’t understand: one time it was
       God speaking, next time it was Jesus speaking, and He was a dual personality, as to say. The
       disciples once said, after, in, I believe, Saint John the 17th chapter, Jesus explaining to them,
       they said, “Lo, now speakest Thou plainly. Now, we know that You come from God, and no man
       don’t have to teach You. You come from God, God does Your teaching, You don’t need any
       education or seminary theologies, God teaches You, and no man tells You what to do: by this we
       believe that Thou comest from God.” He said, “Do you now believe? After all this time, do you
       now believe?” Notice: Ye are gods. 9 Now, 35th verse: If he called them (the prophets) gods,
       unto whom the Word of the Lor-… of God came, Who do the Word of the Lor-… come to?
       The prophets. And God called the prophets, “gods” because they had the Word of God. If a
       man has the Word of God, it’s not the man, it’s the Word that the people’s listening to; it isn’t
       the man, it’s the Word. And if the prophets, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Elisha, if they had THUS SAITH
       THE LORD, God said, “As long as that Word was going from them, they were gods.” God said
       Himself, He was the One done the announcing, because it wasn’t a man, He’d took the man out,
       and put Hisself in there, to speak. If you call them gods… (Now listen.) If you call them gods,
       unto—unto whom the word of God came, and the scriptures cannot be broken; Oh, how I’m…
       Who has more of authority to say that, than Him? “The Scriptures cannot be broken.” If Jesus
       said, “The works that I do, you shall do also,” that cannot be broken. “Yet a little while and the
       world seeth Me no more; yet ye’ll see Me: for I’ll be with you, even in you, to the end of the
       world,” that Scripture cannot be broken. If the Bible said that, “Jesus Christ, the same
       yesterday, today, and forever,” it cannot be broken. Then He has to be the same in principle, the
       same in power, the same in vision, the same in might, it cannot be broken. Jesus said so. Say ye
       of him, who the Father has sanctified, 10 Now the prophets could not be sanctified (potentially)
       by the offering of a bull, or an ox, or something, or a sheep, or a heifer. They were potentially
       under that blood (as the brother, most gallantly, has presented) that they could be sanctified,
       potentially, under the… looking forward to the atonement being made perfect. For under the
       blood of bulls, when the bull died, or the heifer died, or the sheep died, the life in that blood
       could not come back on the prophet because it was a animal’s life; and a animal’s life would
       bring the prophet to an animal. But when the Blood of the Lord Jesus was offered, the Life of
       Christ, which was God, comes on the believer. He said, “Then how can you, if you… if God
       said, Himself, that, ‘you are gods,’ who the Word of God came to, how can you say I blaspheme
       (when He, Who the Father has sanctified, and sent here) when I say that I am the Son of God?
       How can you do it?”

       William Marrion Branham
       203 He said, “If you come back at all, God hasn’t spoke to me.” Uh-huh? See? THERE WAS
       A PROPHET, THERE WAS A SIGN; THERE WAS HIS VOICE. And to fail to obey It
       brought judgment. 204 The Holy Ghost is our prophet today. Fail to hear His Voice? He’s
       identified in the Scripture, that He would say these things. Jesus Christ, the form of the Holy
       Ghost! 205 God dealt with this one man. This, God never deals with groups; it’s with one man.
       Elijah wasn’t a group. John wasn’t a group. They wasn’t a group or a denomination, neither one
       of them. But both of them condemned such. That’s right. John said, “Don’t you think to say we
       have Abraham to our father. God is able of these stones to rise children to Abraham.” 206 And
       
       24
       the end-time sign will have an end-time Voice. And the end-time sign will be according to what
       is predicted in the Bible. AND THE END-TIME VOICE, THAT FOLLOWS THE ENDTIME SIGN, WILL BE EXACTLY IDENTIFIED IN THE SCRIPTURE, WILL BE THE
       SCRIPTURE THAT’S BEEN PROMISED. 207 Now we’ve read in Luke 17 what the end-time
       sign would be, would be like it was at Sodom, a promise. And we have the Sodom in the natural,
       why can’t we believe the sign in spiritual here? If you can see the Scriptures, also, Luke 17 is the
       sign, and Malachi 4 is the Voice. The sign was like God manifested in flesh, knowing the secrets
       of the heart; and the Voice of Malachi 4 was turning the people away from their creeds, back to
       the Faith of the fathers. That’s the sign. 208 You know what? I’m closing now. Signs are usually
       accepted, sure; but, the Voice, oh, no. The Voice that follows the sign, they don’t want nothing
       to do with that. Yes. 209 Jesus’ sign, as Messiah, to heal the sick, they accepted that. But one
       day He said, “I and the Father are One.” 210 OH, MY, THAT VOICE WASN’T ACCEPTED.
       They said, “You make Yourself God, equal with God.” He said, “I’m the Son of God.” 211
       “Oh, my, how could God have a Son?” See? “Far be it from God having a Son!” 212 But, you
       see, they believed the—the sign, the sick could be healed, and, oh, that was wonderful, that was
       just dandy. But when it come to the Voice, they didn’t want to believe the Voice. What’d they
       do? They put Him out.
        Now notice here, that when God calls a preacher…When God calls a preacher, he saw him
       before the world was ever created. He knew who his grand-pappy would be, his grand-mammy
       would be, he knew who his daddy would be, he knew who his mommy would be and he knew
       what he would be. And because he knew what he’d be, he knew that he would love Gods sheep.
       He knew that he would be faithful to the word of God, he knew that he’d be honest with the
       word of God. He knew that he wouldn’t sell out for a morsel of bread like ole Esau and for thirty
       pieces of silver like Judas did. He knew that he would tell the truth, even if they cut his head
       smack off.
        So, he looked down there and said, “That’s him, I’ll call him to preach my gospel!” And then
       God calls him and he lets him come through a certain grand-pappy and through a certain grandmammy and lets him get a certain daddy and he’ll have a little bit of a temper and his mom will
       be just as meek and humble as can be. And his gran-pappy will have a certain thing about him.
       And he brings all them genetics’ together from grand-mommy and grand-pappy and brings them
       all down through there and he comes out with the preacher. And then he meets that preacher and
       saves him by the grace of God. Then there comes a time in his life, oh he’ll know somethings
       strange about him. He may not know God…God will deal with him all along, whether he’s a
       sinner or not. Because salvation… See the Gifts of God and callings of God are without
       repentance.

       60-1204M - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       12 I want you to notice the symbols of Christ, also, in the Bible and here on earth. On the
       earth, He was a Prophet. You believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] A Prophet is
       the Word. We know that. The word prophet means “a divine interpreter of the Word.” The
       divine Word is wrote, and the prophet has the divine Spirit of God within him. And, you know,
       the prophet in the Old Testament was called “god.” How many knew that? Jesus said, “If they
       called them gods…Isn’t it writ in your law, they are, ‘You are gods’? And if they called them
       ‘gods,’ who the Word of God came to, the prophet, how will you condemn Me when I say I’m the
       Son of God?” 214 Because, he was called “god,” because he packed within him the Word of
       God, THUS SAITH THE LORD. Therefore, the word prophet means a, “his—his interpretation
       isn’t to be mingled with.” See? If the God…He says, “If there be one among you, who is
       spiritual, or a prophet, I the Lord will speak to him. What he says comes to pass, then hear
       him, because I’m with him. But if it doesn’t come to pass, then don’t hear him; I haven’t sent
       him.” That’s the way you know it. And then, you see, the divine interpretation of the Word has
       to coincide with this last revelation to the church. 215 He is God, the Almighty. On earth, He
       was a Prophet, which is a eagle. How many know that a prophet is considered an eagle?
       [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] 216 A eagle is the strongest bird we got, most powerful.
       
       26
       Some of their wings stretch fourteen feet, from tip to tip. He can take and fly so high that if any
       other bird try to follow him, he’d disintegrate, feathers would fall out of him and he’d come
       apart. Because why? He’s built special. And what good does it do him to get up that high if he
       can’t see what he’s doing when he’s up there? Talk about a hawk eye? You ought to see a eagle
       eye.
        I never had to repent to get called of God! I was always called of God, to preach the gospel.
       See, your born to preach the gospel. That’s why I was born, to preach the gospel. I didn’t just
       accidently, just fall into the ministry. I was called supernaturally into the ministry.
        See, that’s what upset’s our Baptist people. They can’t understand when you say, “Oh, no no I
       didn’t want to be a preacher! God called me to be a preacher! I never had anything to do with it.”
       God calls a preacher! Then when God calls a preacher he makes him up, his make-up and
       everything is made up to fit the people of the hour. In other-words God knows what it takes,
       what kind of man it takes and his make-up… He makes his make-up to fit the opposition of the
       hour.
        Now notice now everything about that man, everything he does, everything that he acts his
       temperament and everything about him, is molded by God! So, don’t you begin to put your
       finger on one of Gods servants. Don’t never put your hand on God servants saying, “I don’t think
       he ought to be that way!” He’s just the way that God made him! God did not want him any other
       way! GOD MADE HIM THAT WAY! TOUCH NOT MY ANOINTED AND DO MY
       PROPHET’S NO HARM! FOR I HAVE MOLDED HIM AND I HAVE MADE HIM FOR THE
       HOUR THAT THEY’RE LIVING IN! You mind our own business and leave that to God.

       has delivered him into your hands; take his life.” And he cut the piece off of his coat, went back
       up, he said, “God forbid that I touch His anointed.” That’s right. So don’t—don’t say nothing
       evil about Christians. Don’t try to harm Christians, ’cause you’ll reap what you sow every
       time. “Touch not My anointed; do My prophets no harm. For it was far better for you that
       your—that you’d have millstone tied at your neck and drowned in the depths of the sea, than
       to offend My anointed.” Is that right? So don’t say nothing about Christians. Maybe some of
       them don’t live just right, or do just right, but that—that’s God’s child. Let—let the Father take
       care of His Own kiddies. You know? If we go to fighting one another, God give us both a

       And that’s the way it is today, the same thing. And if… He said, “They call the master of the
       house Beelzebub, how much more are they going to call you now, that’s going to see Me to the
       end of the world.” Is that right? Sure. How much more are they going to call you then? 59 But
       here’s what He said. “Woe, unto them.” That’s right. “It would be better that you’d never been
       born in the world, to even offend the least of My anointed.” Is that right? Now, not to do
       anything, but just to offend them in any way, just to say something against it… The Bible said,
       “You’d better have a millstone at your neck, and drowned in the depths of the sea, than even
       to bring an offense.” Is that right? What did Jesus say when they told Him He was Beelzebub?
       He said, “Now, just a moment,” in this word. “I’ll forgive you for that. I’m the Son of God. I’ll
       forgive you. But when the Holy Ghost comes and begins to do the same thing in My Name,
       whoever speaks a word against That, will never be forgiven in this world, or the world to
       come.” Did He say that? Why? Because they said, “It’s an unclean spirit.” Said, “I’m the Son
       of God. I’ll forgive you. But when the Holy Ghost comes now, and gets into the Church, and I
       send My Church forth, and they begin to do that, if you speak one word against it, it’ll never
       be forgiven in this world or the world to come.” So better be careful what we say and what we
       do.
        See, a lot of times we can get into trouble, “Well, why is brother so and so that way? Why is
       he that way? That grinds me!” It’s meant to grind you! Ya, a lot of times we say, “I ain’t goin of
       that brothers house no more! I tell you his ways, just gets me real good!” They’re supposed to
       get you real good! They’re supposed to get you!

       overcome and you got something to overcome. Amen, we’re all sinners saved by grace! And
       God’s working on every one of us! The only thing about it sometimes, some of us yield our self
       to the chisel and hammer a little more than the other. A lot of us don’t want the hammer and the
       chisel, like we ought to have it. BUT WE NEED GOD’S HAMMER OF HIS WORD AND
       GOD’S CHISEL, TO CHISEL US OUT INTO THE IMAGE OF JESUS CHRIST! And that’s
       the only way that you’ll ever look like Christ, if you let the word of God hammer you down and
       make you what you ought to be!
        God calls his preacher and makes him up and all of his makeup and everything about him is

       personally, gives him a supernatural experience brother, that no man, no body, no seminary,
       nothing, no power upon the earth can take that away from him. He knows that he stood in the
       presence of God and heard his voice! He knows that Gods hand is upon him and that he’s called
       for a work and that it, period. See, nothing… No sir! He’s right and everybody else is wrong!

       beggar by the way side. And there he was, he didn’t have no coat around him and he was sitting
       there shivering cold and was gonna freeze to death. And everybody passed him by! But when ole
       Martin passed him by, he had compassion upon him. He was a sinner but he had compassion
       upon the ole man. And he took his coat off, took his sword and ripped it down in half and
       wrapped the ole man up in his coat. And that night when he crawled into his little pup tent…
       I imagine about three and four o'clock in the morning, that’s usually when God comes to his
       servants. When every demon in hell is wore out from juicing all night long, drinking whiskey
       and carousing around in fornication and adultery and livin like an ole hog. God usually come to a
       man of God around four o'clock in the morning. When all the devils are still, you know they’re
       wore out! That’s the only way the devil quietens down, the body who he’s in gets so worn out
       and tried from doin the work of the devil. So, he’s got to go to sleep around day-lite. And it’s
       usually before day-lite when God talks to his servants, while all the devils have quietened down.
       And then about that time, here come this ole beggar walked in Martins tent! Martin seen the ole
       beggar and recognized him and seen his robe. He said, “Martin you know who I am?” He said in
       his mind, I guess he said, “You look like that ole beggar, but I don’t understand this.” He said, “I
       left half of coat today with you” The man said, “I’m Jesus!”
        Oh, Jesus appears in many humble ways friend. You know the Bible said, “Be careful you’ll
       entertain angels unaware.” See, some little humble brother, maybe an angel of God a sent one
       and be so humble and so simple you might not even know it!

        I’ve heard it said many times around the great man of God today, when I used to visit him,

       to hunt rabbits behind my house.” But the poor person didn’t realize, the poor little humble Billy
       turned out to be none other than to be Gods prophet of the hour, Elijah the prophet! My!
        Notice here now, how God calls his preachers. Notice here how are they gonna believe, in
       whom they have not heard? And how are the gonna hear without a preacher? So, the first thing
       we got to come to, God has got to have a preacher somewhere. God has never left the earth
       without a preacher. So, if they’re gonna hear and people are gonna be saved, then they’ve got to
       hear. And if they’re gonna hear, then they have got to have a preacher to preach the gospel to
       them.
        All right now notice, how God appears to his servants. Gives them a supernatural experience.
       Now not all of us! People will say, “I want a supernatural experience” Well see you can’t ask for
       that. See, God in order for you to contact God…God finds somebody that’s chosen of God.

       this preacher find grace in the sight of God? It’s not our business, its only God that knoweth the
       heart, see. “Man looketh upon the outward appearance, but God looketh upon the heart.”

        That why the Bible says, “Judge not, that ye be not judged” You cannot judge one another,
       we should never criticize and judge one another. Oh, if every person here under the sound of my
       voice this morning, could get every bit of criticisms out of their heart! That they WOULD NOT
       JUDGE THEIR BROTHER OR THEIR SISTER! The Bible said, “Judge not, that ye be not

        Brother there was never a time that I judged anybody, that the same thing never fall'ed on
       me! Oh, what a terrible thing it is to have a criticizing, and judging spirit. A real child of God,
       that progressing in the grace of God, they will not judge or criticize. We should never do that,
       that’ll drive the holy spirit clear away from us! Because you don’t know what’s down in that
       person’s heart. You don’t know all those secrets down in there and it’s best to love everybody.
       Criticize nobody, talk about nobody! If your gonna say anything, say something good about the
       person. “Well, she wears her dresses to short.” Leave it to the preacher. “Well I don’t think they
       ought to do that!” Leave it to the preacher! Live a life so salty, that it’ll make everybody thirsty
       around you. How many wants to do it? (Amen) OH GOD, THAT WE COULD GET EVERY

        LOVE SUFFERETH LONG AND LOVE IS KIND. Give me the Love of God every time!
       Take every bit of criticism, EVERY BIT OF JEALOUSY EVERY BIT OF THE WORKS OF
       THE DEVIL TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME AND GIVE ME THE DOVE OF GOD DOWN IN
       MY HEART! WE NEED THE LOVE OF GOD, THIS MORNING more than anything else in
       this world. The world is dying, to see the love of God.
       1 Corinthians 13:4-Reference quote:
       4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed
       up,
        Let me tell you something! That’s why I don’t believe, in the laity preaching the gospel. I
       believe if any man is called to preach the gospel, he’s called to live and preach it and he can do it
       behind the pulpit. But the children of God ARE CALLED TO LIVE SALTY before the people.
        And I believe a child of God is to be honest. I believe a child of God ought to keep his word.
       And let me say this while I’m at it. I’m reminded time and time again of myself, that I must keep
       my word. And I should always say, “If it’s the Lords will, I’ll do it. I’ll come here, I’ll do this if
       it’s the Lord’s will.” That’s why I believe a child of God, the Lord expects us to keep our word.
       As I was saying many times, I say it this way. I said, “If I gave you a hundred dollars and I gave
       it out of my heart, I give you a hundred dollars a free gift.” But if you ask to borrow five cents, I
       want that five cents back. It’s not I care a hill of beans about the five cents, but I want you to
       keep your word.
        AND THAT’S SOMETHING I FIND THAT’S LACKING AMONG THE PEOPLE OF
       GOD TODAY! We’ll say, “I’ll do such and such a thing!” And then six months will pass by and
       you don’t do what you said! And to the person whom you said you would do it he holds that
       against you! And the devil holds that against you, and he goes before the throne of God and says,
       “Your child said they would do this, and they did not do it” CHILDREN OF GOD WE NEED
       TO KEEP OUR WORD! If I borrow ten dollars, and I say, “I’ll pay it back, next month” And
       then next month rolls around and I don’t come and pay that back, I’m a sinner before God! And
       then if I don’t have the money to pay it back, then I must come around and say, “Brother dear, I
       told you last month when I borrowed this money that I would pay it back. But would you please
       forgive me? I meant to keep my word but I can’t keep my word, I don’t have the money. But I’ll
       pay you a dollar, I’ll pay you a dollar and then if God will help me, next month I believe I can
       pay it.” And then that man will have no ought against you. But if you owe that man and you
       know that you owe him and then you shun him. And I’ve seen Christian people that are called by
       his name in this hour, tryin to make the rapture, will borrow money and will buy things. And
       instead of coming and tellin the person, that they was not able to pay it and keep their word, see.
       Then they shun them! That’s wrong! THAT’S WRONG! And the devil goes before Jesus Christ
       and says, “Look what your child done!” We are to keep our word; we are to be honest! Yes, sir!
        And if I give one of my minister friends five hundred dollars, wonderful! But if he ever asks
       me to borrow a twenty-dollar bill, brother I tell you I’ll remember that twenty-dollar bill, if its
       ten years. And it’ll kill confidence in him, I want him to come back and give me that twenty
       dollars. And then somehow, it’s like I need it, come on and pay me!

        I knew a widow woman that had no husband and she wouldn’t pay her tithes because she was
       needy. And I burnt tithing right out two or three minutes, I hardly harp on it. But I want to see
       her obey God. I want to see every child of God obey God. I don’t want their tithes, but I want to
       see that they pay their tithes, because I want them filled with the Holy Ghost. AND I KNOW
       THAT GOD ONLY GIVES THE HOLY GHOST TO THEM THAT OBEY HIS WORD!
       Whether it’s in tithing or cutting your hair or dressing yourself in modest apparel. Or husbands
       ahead of your house and women being little housekeepers or whatever it is. I believe that
       everyone of us ought to be faithful in the calling, where we are called.

       Now, couldn’t we not type that and make a message out of it tonight, to the Pentecostal church?
       Until we completely surrender ourselves to God, in obedience to all of His Word… God don’t
       give us the Holy Ghost and say, “Well, I got it. That’s all there is to it.” No, sir. He give you
       the Holy Spirit for action, for Word, for service. Until we obey, hunger in our hearts… There’s
       enough Pentecostal people setting right in here tonight, to start a Pentecostal revival through
       this country here, that would—it would certainly do things around here, if we’d just get the fire
       burning good, you know, and get the high wind blowing from heaven, like rushing mighty wind,
       something would take place.

       64-0208 - The Token
       William Marrion Branham
       116 And when we can display the Token of the Holy Spirit, shows that we have been accepted in
       Christ, and that is our Token that all that we have need of is already purchased by Him. We are
       identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 117 The Blood, Covenant Blood, is not
       recognized without the Token. The Word assures us of the promise. The Token is the sign the
       purchase has been made for us. 118 Full obedience to the full Word of God entitles us to the
       Token. No other way is there, that you could ever be entitled to the Token, until you fully obey
       the Word. Not what somebody has put into It, and added to It; but what God said about It! 119
       When He said, “You must be born again.” That don’t mean jump up-and-down at the altar; that
       don’t mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor; that don’t mean all this foolishness
       that we’ve seen done; it don’t mean putting your name on a church book. It means death to your
       first being, and Life to the second being. It means that the Blood has been applied, and you’re
       identified by the Life of Jesus Christ. And if He be the Vine, and we be the branches, the Life
       that’s in the branch is in also from the Vine. It’ll bear the fruit. 120 If that first branch come
       forth, that branch out of that Vine, that wrote a book of Acts behind it; if that branch ever puts
       forth, a Vine puts forth another branch, they’ll write another book of Acts behind it, ’cause
       it’s the same Life. If a one of your grapevines out here brings forth blue grapes, if it puts forth
       another branch, it’ll bring forth blue grapes. 121 And I tell you, today, we got so many grafted
       vines into It, with denominations and creeds and things, and yet any citrus fruit grafted in can
       live, live in that Vine. But it’s bearing the wrong fruit. 122 What we need, today, is another
       baptism of the Holy Spirit, and have the real Power of God that identifies the works that Jesus
       
       32
       Christ promised for this day, not so much as that day. This day, the promise that He made
       here. That was what He promised there, He would pour out His Spirit. Now He has promised
       it again in the last days, and what He would do.
        That’s why I believe every wife… I hear some women say, “Well, I just can’t cook!” Why
       can’t you cook? You say, “Well, I just can’t clean house!” Why, can’t you clean house? God
       called you to be the best housekeeper of anybody in town. God called you to be the best cook of
       anybody in town. God called you to be the best wife to that husband better than anybody in town.
        And then you wonder why you don’t have no revelation! That’s why, you don’t have know
       revelation. You don’t want to be faithful in the calling where in you we’re called. Oh, how
       blessed it is, FOR EVERY MAN, EVERY WOMAN TO ABIDE IN THE CALLING WHERE
       IN they’re called! If thou cannot be faithful in the little things, how are you gonna be faithful in
       the big things? Be honest!
        Women be good housekeepers. I think a real sainted woman of God…Now let me tell you
       something! I know these little things make a difference. I think a Christian ought to be the
       cleanest! I think their dresses ought to…I don’t care…
        I’ve preached down in the mountains of Kentucky. Where them men would cut your throat
       from ear to ear. They’d blow your brains out in a minute if you’d call them a liar and insult them
       in some way. But they know whether or not you love them. They know whether you love God or
       not. And you better have the goods when you preach to people like that.
        I seen ole women back there, brother I don’t care… maybe they only got two dresses. My
       grandmother raised me. She made her dresses out of feed sacks, out of feed sacks.
        But I think a real little child of God, she may be as poor as “Gabe’s Turkey” as they say down
       south. But let me tell you something! A little child of God she’ll clean and wash that dress and
       patch it. She’ll be the cleanest nicest little lady she can be.
        See there’s just something about God, something about God everything about God is clean
       and pure and Holy! And I think, that’s the way we ought to be.
        And I… I…How many just let me say it? (Amen) Sometimes I think it’s none of my business.
       But it is my business, too! It is my business to do it!
        I went across the country, and I’ve seen Christian people come and stay with other Christian
       people and impose upon them. We should never do that! A Christian will never impose upon
       nobody. I believe we are to be the most hospitable people upon the earth. But a Christian, the
       bible said…Paul said, “Let every man work, and he that don’t work let him not eat!” “Let every
       man eat his own bread at home in quietness”
       2 Thessalonians 3:10-Reference quote:
       10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither
       should he eat.
       2 Thessalonians 3:12-Reference quote:
       12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness
       they work, and eat their own bread.
        I think that every man, ought to strive to support his self and to pay his bills. And then when
       you go across the country you see people professing to be Christians.
       
       33
        And I remember one incident, when I my nose into it and got in all kinds of trouble. And here
       a family come and you’d think they was so spiritual. Brother, they was so spiritual, they was no
       earthy value at all. They come in this poor man’s house, that was having a hard time his self and
       paying big rent. And the landlord had immaculate floors glistening and shining. And don’t you
       know, that man that is a Christian will take better care of a man’s house than he will. Just
       because you’re paying rent on it… Just like, he’s paying the electric bill, “Well, let’s just leave
       the light on honey, the landlord is paying the electric bill” Don’t you, do that! The Bible said,
       “You do unto other as you would have them do unto you!” See, but if you was the landlord,
       you wouldn’t like it, would you?
       Luke 6:31-Reference quote:
       31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
        Don’t you forget that Jesus is looking on! And what so-ever you do in word or deed, do it all
       in Jesus name! And what you can’t do in Jesus name, honey don’t you do it.
       Colossians 3:17-Reference quote:
       17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
       God and the Father by him.
        And I was there, and I happen to walk in! And brother, I lead him to the Lord. He was
       begging me to come over and stay with him. And I don’t normally do that! But he just pressed
       upon me so, I said, “I will come.” And when I come and came there he said, “This couple is
       coming out today.” I went in there and that…I tell you; I needed an oxygen mask! That was the
       foulest stink'est room I ever seen in my life. And the sheets were so filthy and so dirty, looked
       like hogs had slept in them. And the floor was rotted out from baby diapers layin upon the floor.
       And the man stayed there all that time. And the woman never took a bath all that time, just…Let
       me tell you, that’s wrong!
        Why, let me tell you something! You don’t want to wear deodorant…A lot of people are so
       spiritual today that they don’t want to wear deodorant. Now that’s silly but, I tell you some
       people got heads, that I think have wood in them. Ain’t got enough common sense, then nothing!
       Well, you don’t want…What do you think about the person sitting beside of you? See, that’s just
       the way you smell without deodorant, that’s the way your life smells to Jesus Christ! Type it in
       the spiritual! How many say, amen to that? (Amen)
        And there, it just provoked me so bad that I just lost control! When I went in there and seen
       that poor little tender-hearted brother that let that man live in his house for three months and
       never shared one penny. The wife never turned her hand, to do anything. And it just got the best
       of me because I loved him. I started crying. And there he was down there with a plane, planing
       that floor where them baby diapers… excuse me urine just ate right through the floor. And oh
       my, it just got me so bad! I went outside and said, “Sister you call yourself a Christian!” And I
       just raked her over the coals good! And boy she ran out of there screaming like I stabbed her
       with a knife. Like I was running after her with a knife. And she ran out of that house screaming
       that the whole neighborhood could hear her. And run up there and here come her husband, and
       don’t you think he didn’t let me have it! I said, “You sit down there young man a minute and let
       me talk to you! I said don’t you come here acting that way! You lived in this man’s house and
       you never paid him one penny! You lived in this room here, like hogs and animals. There is
       
       34
       nothing, Christ like about that! You’ve lost your testimony, you don’t have no right to call
       yourself a Christian. Don’t tell me nothing, I went to the washi tier (Laundromat) and washed
       those sheets.” And I raked him over the coals. After I repented, and I asked the Lord to forgive
       me for that, I shouldn’t of don’t it. But it just got me so bad, I couldn’t stand it!
        But what the point I’m sayin, WE GOT A TESTIMONY! That’s why I believe when the road
       sign say’s 60 miles an hour, we ought to drive the speed limit! And when you get a ticket, then
       you lost your testimony! I believe a Christian is the cream of the crop! I believe a woman that’s a
       Christian she’s the best wife, the best housekeeper. She may not be all at once, but she’s striving
       for it. Why? Because when they wash dishes its unto the Lord, when you clean your house,
       YOUR CLEANING HOUSE UNTO THE LORD!
        And that’s why I believe when a man employs a Christian, HE GETS THE BEST MAN
       THAT HE CAN FIND. You’ll find out when you move into an area, and you started church and
       your saints begin to hear the true word of God and they go to an employer, they all notice a
       difference. They don’t have five coffee breaks. They’re not sitting over there joking and goofing
       off from work. They’re right there giving; a Christian will give you a good day’s work for the
       pay that you made a deal for.
        How many believe those things. “Why are you saying those things brother Bob?” That’s what
       makes you a Christian. How many want to do those things? (Amen) A Christian will be the most
       honest person you can find. He’ll obey God! He’ll do the things that please God. She’ll be the
       best wife, she’ll be the best cook, she’ll do everything she can do to please God. Why? Because
       the Bible say’s whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in Jesus name. And what you can’t do
       in word or deed in what you’re doing, and you can’t do it in Jesus name, well honey, why do it in
       Jesus name. If you can’t do it in Jesus Name, don’t do it! Because God knoweth the heart. God
       knoweth our heart, he knows whether or not we’re bein honest.
       Colossians 3:17-Reference quote:
       17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
       God and the Father by him.
       Jeremiah 17:10-Reference quote:
       10 I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and
       according to the fruit of his doings.
       Psalm 139-Reference quote:
       23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
       Psalm 44:21-Reference quote:
       21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
        And that’s why God gives us law! What would we do without the law of God? What would
       we do without policeman’s out here? And we don’t like policeman’s, we don’t like stop lights,
       we don’t like the rules upon the highway. Listen! The highways are not safe! How would it be
       today without any laws?
        See, God requires us to do all these little things. You are the salt of the earth.
       
       35
       Matthew 5:13-Reference quote:
       13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it
       is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
        And let me tell you something! A Christian isn’t Critical or shouldn’t be. But you take a
       person out there, that doesn’t believe the gospel doesn’t believe Christianity, and he’s the most
       critical person that ever was! He’s just waitin for you to make just one little mistake. And it may
       be a little thing to you, but he’ll make a mountain out of a mole hill! And he rejoices in it! “Oh,
       but you lost your spirit, you got mad!” See! Now, he’ll not look at all the good that you do, but
       he’ll only find the bad! See!
        And I think that’s the way we ought to do, we ought to try to find the good in everybody. See
       the good in our brother. The bible said, “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God” A
       lot of us some of us, can’t see God in any of us! And we’re so easy to un'Christianize one
       another. Un'Christianize one another! “This one ain’t in the message, that one ain’t in the
       message!” God knows who’s in the message. God knows!
       Matthew 5:8-Reference quote:
       8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
        Now as I’m getting back to my subject now.
       How are they gonna hear without a preacher? And how are they gonna preach…how are they
       gonna preach except they be called? See! Now the first thing in order for you to find God’s
       salvation, you’ve got to hear! You’ve got to be able to hear! And how can you hear, without a
       preacher? See you’ve got to have a preacher! See! Now what if everybody was right and there
       was no more preachers today? People say, “Well, there’s no more preachers today it’s all over!”
       Then there’s no Bride!

       50 The same thing repeats! That’s the evidence of the Holy Ghost, when God reveals to you
       and you see it, THUS SAITH THE LORD and accept it. Not what you are, what you was, or
       nothing about it, it’s what God has done for you now. There’s the evidence. 51 Jesus said…He
       give us the evidence of the Holy Ghost, John 14. He said, “I have many things to tell you. I
       haven’t got time to do it, but when the Holy Ghost comes, He will tell you, bring to your memory
       the things that I told you about, and will also show you things that is to come.” Don’t you see?
       There’s the evidence. That’s forthtelling and being…having the Divine interpretation of the
       written Word. Now, isn’t that the evidence of a prophet? 52 A seer in the Bible was a man that
       could forthtell and it’d be perfectly, exactly, not somebody laid hands on him, that’s a gift. A
       prophet is predestinated and borned to be a prophet. See? All the whole life it was a prophet,
       that’s a office. That’s where the people… 53 Many of the questions here on: “Well, will the
       Bride…?” “Will this…?” “The church and…” See? You—you can’t divide what they are. The
       Bride is the Elected of God. The church goes through…That’s the ones It says, “Whosoever will,
       let him come.” BUT THE BRIDE IS THE ELECTED OF GOD. 54 THERE IS FIVE
       OFFICES ELECTED OF GOD. “FOR GOD HAS SET IN THE CHURCH APOSTLES,
       PROPHETS, TEACHERS, PASTORS, EVANGELISTS.” GOD DID THAT.
       
        The Apostle Paul said, “How are they going to hear without a preacher?”
       Romans 10:14-Reference quote:
       14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in
       him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
        And Brother Branham said in 1965, “Two thirds of the world has never heard yet.” And we
       are under a spiritual moral obligation of God to take this gospel into all the world to every
       creature. And then the end will come. I believe that with all my heart.

       with Him one time. Don’t try to stall and argue about the thing, just get in love with Him, and
       you’ll, He’ll reveal it to you. Hide it from the theological seminaries and reveal it to babes such
       as will learn. It’s proved to be the truth. You’ve had twenty, oh, almost two thousand years to
       prove your argument, and you fail till two-thirds of the world has never heard of Jesus Christ
       yet. Give me five hundred people born of the Spirit of God, filled with the Holy Ghost, and on
       
       37
       fire for God, I’ll do more for the kingdom of God in one year’s time, than the whole church
       has done in two thousand years. That’s right. That’ll believe in signs and wonders and
       miracles, and be truly, not a make belief, but truly borned of the Spirit of God. That’s right.
       What we need, that’s God’s program. All right, just a minute now. Let’s get these things.

       227 How things are going! He said, in the last days, “Fear not, little flock. It’s your Father’s
       good will to give you the Kingdom,” sitting together in Heavenly places. 228 And you
       Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, who has laughed at pentecost… 229 And, I say, Pentecost
       needs a good old-fashion Gospel spanking, because they organize. The very Assemblies of God
       has went into the—the biggest of Pentecost, has joined the league of churches, just as formal and
       indifferent. And the worst I ever seen the Holy Ghost treated, nearly, was by Pentecostal
       preachers. So don’t think, ’cause you belong to Pentecostal church, you’re saved. 230 You’re
       only saved when you’re truly baptized with God’s Spirit, by the Holy Ghost, united with Him
       in the Power of His resurrection, going forth with signs and wonders, following that Spirit
       wherever It go. The signs followed the prophets. The signs followed Jesus Christ. The signs
       followed the apostles. He said, “These signs shall follow them,” till He returns again. “Did That
       say that, Brother Branham?” 231 “Go ye into all the world, and preach this Power and
       demonstration to every nation.” And it lacks two-thirds of it, yet, has never heard It. “And these
       signs shall follow them.” “Them!” “Every nation!” 232 Glory! Whew! Oh, my! Maybe you’ll
       think I’m crazy. Brother, I tell you, I love this good old-time religion. Yes, sir, anchors you in
       Christ!
       
        Notice here Paul said, “Who-so-ever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” And
       then the apostle Paul, Peter said that in the book of Acts. And Paul brings it over in Romans said,
       “And how are they gonna hear without a preacher?” See!
        All right now, the first thing there’s God to be a preacher. Not just any preacher, he’s got to
       be a God called preacher. A God called preacher is the only kind of preacher that’ll ever do you
       any good. He’s the only one, that you’ll ever hear the plan of salvation from. He’s the only one
       that’ll ever tell you the truth, because he’s God called. And he who God calls, speaks the word of
       God. It may just displease everybody else, but it’ll please God. Why? Because any God called
       preacher, has only one desire and that is to please God.
        Now notice here. Now let me bring the rest of this out, something that I have never said
       before, now on the gospel. Now notice this, how can they hear without a preacher? How can they
       preach without…? How they gonna hear without a preacher?
        Now notice this, the Bible said, “Faith cometh by hearing.” Now that’s, future tense! It
       cometh, future tense, by hearing. Now that’s the way we get revelation.

       Now, they hadn’t… The Bible wasn’t written then. So if Cain, his brother who set under the same
       teaching of father and mother, came down and brought fruit to make the offering… But Abel, by
       revelation he saw that it wasn’t fruits that brought us out of the garden of Eden, as some people
       still think it was. But it wasn’t fruits. It was the blood of his mother who made him mortal, or his
       father. So he came and offered the blood of a lamb by Divine revelation. No one to tell him
       anything about it, but he, by faith he seen the Son of God coming, and offered a lamb in a
       figurative type, seeing that Jesus was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world. And
       God testified, “That’s the truth.” God will always testify the truth. That’s the reason I’m so
       happy when we can introduce to the nations of the world, a resurrected Jesus Christ. It’s not a
       fiction story, a story of fiction. It is a absolute positive statement of Jehovah God Himself, that
       He raised up Jesus from the dead. And it can be proven. That’s the good part about it. Now,
       Cain, when he seen his brother, ’course, he slew his brother, was jealous. But notice how Abel
       got this. 17 Now, Jesus when He come to the earth, coming down off of Mount Transfiguration,
       one day, or off the mountain, they said, “Who does man say I the Son of man am?” And some
       of them said, “Well, some says You’re Moses: and some, Elias; and some so forth, the prophet.”
       He said, “But Who do you say I am?” Peter said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
       God.” And He turned to Peter and said, “Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona (the son of Jonas in
       other wise): for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. You never learned it by any
       reading. You never learned it by any seminary. You never learned it by any scholarship. See?
       Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in heaven has revealed it
       to you. And I say, thou art Peter, and upon this Rock…” What? Spiritual revelation that Jesus
       is the Christ, not mental conception, but spiritual revelation. “Flesh and blood has not
       revealed to you, but My Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you. And upon this
       Rock I’ll build My Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against It.” 18 What is it? A
       revelation. What is faith? Is God, by the Spirit revealing to you something that He’s going to
       do or He’s promised. Now, if you only hear: “Faith cometh by hearing,” but hearing is not
       faith. A loaf of bread is purchased for twenty-five cents. But twenty-five cents is not the loaf of
       bread. See? Hearing does… Hearing only brings the Word that produces faith. But “Faith is
       the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Then you see, you hear the
       Word, God reveals It to you, that It is the truth, and by Spirit revealed truth, confirms your
       faith to God. You get it? Now, notice. Then that’s the Church that God built upon the Rock
       that the gates of hell can’t prevail against It.

       81 Now, a man can have an intellectual faith. And there is where most people get, today, calling
       themselves Christians. The reason you see such carrying on, as you do, under the name of
       Christianity, it’s only intellectual faith. “What do you mean by intellectual faith, brother?” This
       is it… “Man believeth unto salvation.” “Now, faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the Word.”
       82 Now, I could preach the Word. You could accept It, say, “That’s all right. Yeah, I believe
       
       39
       That.” Well, now, if that’s all the farther it ever goes, then you’ll never get very far with God.
       Intellectual faith. 83 That’s the reason people doesn’t get healed, is because they only have an
       intellectual view of it, what their mind conceives. But the mind will reason. The mind will say, “It
       cannot be. I am no better.” My sense of sight says, that, “My arm is no straighter than it was
       yesterday.” My sense of feeling says, “I don’t feel any different than I did yesterday.” 84
       Reasoning, mental theology, will reason out, say, “Well, now wait a minute, I believe That’s
       foolishness.” See, you’re reasoning. That intellectual faith will do that.
        That’s why Brother Branham said, one hundred percent obedience to the word of God,
       entitles you to the Token. Is, that right? Now one hundred percent obedience to the word of God,
       entitles you to the token.

       64-0208 - The Token
       William Marrion Branham
       116 And when we can display the Token of the Holy Spirit, shows that we have been accepted in
       Christ, and that is our Token that all that we have need of is already purchased by Him. We are
       identified with our Token. The Token must be ready. 117 The Blood, Covenant Blood, is not
       recognized without the Token. The Word assures us of the promise. The Token is the sign the
       purchase has been made for us. 118 Full obedience to the full Word of God entitles us to the
       Token. No other way is there, that you could ever be entitled to the Token, until you fully obey
       the Word. Not what somebody has put into It, and added to It; but what God said about It! 119
       When He said, “You must be born again.” That don’t mean jump up-and-down at the altar; that
       don’t mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor; that don’t mean all this foolishness
       that we’ve seen done; it don’t mean putting your name on a church book. It means death to your
       first being, and Life to the second being. It means that the Blood has been applied, and you’re
       identified by the Life of Jesus Christ. And if He be the Vine, and we be the branches, the Life
       that’s in the branch is in also from the Vine. It’ll bear the fruit. 120 If that first branch come
       forth, that branch out of that Vine, that wrote a book of Acts behind it; if that branch ever puts
       forth, a Vine puts forth another branch, they’ll write another book of Acts behind it, ’cause
       it’s the same Life. If a one of your grapevines out here brings forth blue grapes, if it puts forth
       another branch, it’ll bring forth blue grapes. 121 And I tell you, today, we got so many grafted
       vines into It, with denominations and creeds and things, and yet any citrus fruit grafted in can
       live, live in that Vine. But it’s bearing the wrong fruit. 122 What we need, today, is another
       baptism of the Holy Spirit, and have the real Power of God that identifies the works that Jesus
       Christ promised for this day, not so much as that day. This day, the promise that He made
       here. That was what He promised there, He would pour out His Spirit. Now He has promised
       it again in the last days, and what He would do.

       I’ve tried to make it just as plain as I can, yet in all of it, there’s no way at all for me to get it to

       He that is the elected Life, the predestinated Life, that’s in Me,” and He is the Word, “from the
       beginning; when he comes forth, he’ll bear My fruits.” Saint John 14:12. But others will live
       by the same thing, calling themselves Christians and believers. “Not all that saith, ‘Lord, Lord,’
       will enter in.” Now, this is to take place and be manifested in the last days, “when the mysteries
       of God should be finished,” as we’ll get to a little later. 52 These trees, the true vine and false
       vine! You’ve heard me preach on that since, from years ago, how they’ve growed up together.
       Brought them in individuals and showed that, from Cain and Abel, the two vines that met at an
       altar; both of them religious, both of them anointed, both of them desiring life, and worshipping
       the same God. And one was rejected and the other received. And the only way that the one that
       was received could have done anything different from his brother, it was revealed to him. For
       the Bible said, “By faith…” Hebrews, 11th chapter, “By faith Abel offered unto God a more
       excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God testified that he was righteous.” Jesus, said,
       the spiritual revelation of Who He was! “Who does man say I the Son of man am?” He said,
       Peter said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” “Blessed art thou, Simon—
       Simon, son of Jonas; flesh and blood never revealed this to you. My Father which is in
       Heaven has revealed it. Upon this rock I’ll build My Church,” (what?) the true revelation of
       the Word. There is the true Vine again. “Abel, by faith!” You said, “It wasn’t a revelation.” 53
       What is faith? FAITH IS SOMETHING THAT’S REVEALED TO YOU; THAT IS NOT YET,
       BUT YOU BELIEVE IT WILL BE. FAITH IS A REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD.
       SO, BY REVELATION! 54 And the churches today don’t even believe in spiritual revelation.
       They believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system. “BY REVELATION Abel OFFERED
       UNTO GOD A MORE EXCELLENT SACRIFICE than that of Cain, WHICH GOD
       TESTIFIED HE WAS RIGHTEOUS.” Amen. I hope you see that. See where we’re living? See
       the hour?
       
       41
        And the Bible said that God would save the world by the foolishness of testimonies (No) The
       bible said that God would save the world by the reading of his word. (No) God would save the
       world by what? (By preaching!) Don’t you see that God is perfect and that God never changes.
       What he says in one scripture, if you can’t dove-tail it together with the whole Bible, then it’s not
       God! We can’t base our Faith upon one scripture, you’ve got to dove-tail all the scriptures
       together.
       1 Corinthians 1:21-Reference quote:
       1 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the
       foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
        We quote Brother Branham today, like we quoted Paul. People say, “Well, you’re talking
       about a man!” But brother you’ve got to talk about the man. See, that’s so offensive. But the
       same people talk about somebody else.
        If you we’re living in the days of John the Baptist, all the children of God talked about John
       the Baptist. And then if you was living in the days of Jesus, after John left you’d talk about Jesus.
       And then after Jesus died everybody talked about Peter. Then after they talked about Peter then
       they all talked about Paul, see. And then if God ever uses somebody else today, they’ll start
       talkin about him. And if God uses you, they’ll talk about you, see. It’s nature, it’s God’s spiritual
       nature.

       97 Then after Moses, come John. And after John, the dispensation come, he introduced Jesus.
       And when Jesus come to try to bring us grace, which was God in the Spirit, in the line of Spirit,
       manifested His love, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,” and
       Jesus was so different and contrary to the law, see, but it was a different dispensation, a
       different time. 98 And then when Jesus left, He spoke of this dispensation of the Holy Spirit,
       the Life inside, a Witness of Him of the resurrection. I got lots of Scriptures here, but I just
       haven’t got time to get into them, I’ll just brief them over. All right. It’s always been a fact and
       a—a fight, WHEN ONE DISPENSATION IS CHANGING FROM AN OLD
       DISPENSATION TO A PRESENT-TIME MESSAGE, IT’S ALWAYS BEEN A FIGHT
       WITH THE PEOPLE. They—they—they…It’s, although it’s been always Scriptural. But during
       the time that God gives them a dispensation and something to live by, or something to do. Now
       we find out that immediately after that dispensation is given, the men of the earth try to find
       something to counteract that, and something to make a man-made affair of it. 99 After Noah had
       the ark, and then immediately after that, Nimrod, that renegade, he built a tower, and said, “If
       the floods would come, we’ll just climb up and get above it.” And then God come along with the
       law that just…See, that dispensation had lived its time out. 100 And when Jesus came, also,
       after the law, the law spoke of Moses and…spoke of the coming of Christ. But when He came,
       they was so set in the traditions of the fathers, they had their creeds, they had their fashions, they
       had their churches, they were settled down, so it was so hard for Jesus to try to shake that
       kingdom (that church) from a creed, to believe Him. And yet the Scriptures especially spoke of
       
       42
       this One all the way from the first dispensation of Eden, “His Seed shall bruise the serpent’s
       head.” PROMISED JESUS THROUGH EACH ONE OF THE DISPENSATION, AND,
       WHEN HE COME, THEY DIDN’T RECOGNIZE HIM, BECAUSE THEY WERE SO
       BOUND IN THEIR CREED. BUT YET IT WAS THE SCRIPTURAL TRUTH. EACH
       MESSENGER AND ITS MESSAGE FORETOLD THE OTHER ONE TO FOLLOW, each
       time. Moses, the prophets foretold, Moses foretold of the coming of Jesus. Moses said, “The
       Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet like unto me.” How many times have we been through
       that in our Messages around the world, THAT THE COMING MESSIAH WAS TO BE A
       PROPHET! 101 That’s why the ill-famed woman, against all the ministers, she believed the
       Message. The woman at Samaria, when Jesus was speaking to her, He said, “Bring Me a drink.”
       102 She said, “You have nothing to draw with. It’s not customary for You to ask me, a Samaritan
       woman.” And the conversation went on. Then He said, “Go get your husband and come here.”
       She said, “I have none.” 103 Said, “That’s right, you got five, and the one you’re living with
       now is not yours.” 104 SHE SAID, “SIR, I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE A PROPHET.
       NOW, WE KNOW THAT THERE’S COMING A CHANGE OF DISPENSATION. THERE
       IS COMING ONE WHO’S GOING TO BE ANOINTED, THAT’S CALLED THE MESSIAH,
       THE CHRIST OF GOD, AND, WHEN HE COMES, HE WILL BE THAT PROPHET.” How
       much more that woman knowed than all the preachers of that day! Yes. And her in her
       condition, see, she understood the Scripture. Yet, a poor little woman, married with five
       husbands, and living with the sixth one, and yet she knew more about the Scriptures, because she
       took It just for Its face value. And she said, “When He comes, He’ll be a Prophet.” What did
       Jesus say to her? “I am Him.” 105 And she left her waterpot and ran into the city, said, “Come,
       see a Man Who told me the things I’ve done. ISN’T THAT THE VERY MESSIAH?” See?
       That’s Him. 106 Now, see, she—she knew that He was coming, because the prophets and the
       Scripture had, in the days of Moses, and the days of the prophets, and all the way back in each
       one of those dispensations, had said, “He’ll be here, and this is what He’ll be!” Oh, my! 107 If
       the people could only see that today, then they’d know the day we’re living. They would see it’s
       God’s promise for this day. God said it would be this way. There’s nothing wrong, God’s great
       clock is ticking just exactly the right time. And, even according to science, it’s three minutes till
       midnight. So, you see, the stroke might come at any time. And that’s been two or three years ago
       since they said that. See, we’re at the end time. But, you see, we’ve changed dispensations from
       the old church age of back here where that dismal day was, just join church and put your name
       on the book; until the evening Light, the restoration, the return again of the Holy Spirit upon
       the earth, another pentecost, another sign, another thing was to take place. And the people
       doesn’t believe It, because they’re so set like they was in the days of Jesus. See? HE TOLD OF
       THIS DAY. WHEN HE WAS HERE ON EARTH, HE COME EXACTLY ACCORDING TO
       SCRIPTURE; THEN HE FORETOLD OF THIS DAY COMING. 108 Now, now we want to
       think of another one here. I got…If you want to read some of it, Matthew 24. Jesus told of this
       day, He said the Jews would gather again at the last day. He said, “When you see the fig tree
       putting forth its buds, then know the time is at hand.” He said, “There’ll be a perplexity of time,
       distress between nations, the sea roaring; man failing of heart trouble, constantly.” It’s not
       among the women, now. It’s amongst the men. Jesus never said the women; “men.” Look at the
       plague! And in that day what would come to pass! That would be the end-time sign, “Hearts
       failing, fear, perplexed.” Revelation, when It spoke, the prophet speaking of this day, he said that
       there would come a time that the church would be lukewarm, the Laodicean Church Age in the
       last days. See? What is it? It’s Jesus (the last age) predicting the end of this age. 109 Just exactly
       
       43
       like in Eden, like down in Noah’s time, and down in the time of Moses, down in the time of the
       law—law, and then a time of grace, and now in the evening time. There’s many others there if
       we—we had time, but I’ve just skipped over them ’cause we won’t have time. Of each one saying
       what would be in the next age, but the church becomes so church-ie with their creeds, with their
       dogmas, and their make-beliefs and their man-made theories, until they miss that Word. Now you
       can see what evening-time evangelism is going to be. See? What is it? The ones that carry It is
       going to be called crazy. They’ll be so different! They was in Noah’s time, they was in every
       time. Put out of their churches because they believed in Jesus, anybody that listened to Him had
       to be excommunicated from their church. See? BUT HE HAD THAT DISPENSATION, THAT
       WAS HIS TIME, THE SON’S DISPENSATION.
        Now notice here, how are they gonna hear, Paul said how are they gonna call upon the name
       of the Lord to be saved? And how are they gonna call, except they hear? And how are they
       gonna believe, except they hear? And how are they gonna hear without a preacher. So, first
       we’ve got to have a preacher. The people’s there but first, God said he would save the world, by
       the foolishness of preaching.
        Why did he say, “Foolish?” You know it’s foolish to get up here, rave and holler and carry on
       like I do and like other ministers do. Like Brother Branham did. It’s foolish ain’t it? (Amen)
       Why, God could go ahead and save you, any way that he wanted to. But that’s the way that he
       chose to save us, by the foolishness of preaching.
        Not notice here, first we got the people there, Gods people are there that’s gonna be saved.
       Then first it’s the preacher. God calls the preacher and God equips the preacher, God trains the
       preacher. See! That’s many want to be preachers, but they don’t want to be trained. Brother
       Branham said, God may train a man for years and years and years and only use him for three
       months or use him for three days.

       few months, the gospel flood the earth, in six months maybe. See, what is it? All this training, all
       these tears, sweating and toil to try to be what we ought to be. Just for God to use for just a few
       short months.

       56-0115 - The Junction Of Time
       William Marrion Branham
       11 And, always, it takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence. Omnipotence is the allpowerful, and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence. And only the miraculous can
       do that. Teaching of the Word is a very fine thing, and we…it comes, “Faith comes by
       hearing, and hearing the Word,” but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the
       omnipotent still lives and reigns. We must have the miraculous. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE
       CHURCH IS NOW STANDING ON A THRESHOLD OF THE GREATEST VINDICATION
       OF OMNIPOTENCE THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. There has been… 12 In my
       searching of the Scripture, for quite a while, I have found seven great junctions in God’s Word.
       And seven is God’s complete number. We…He—He completes in seven. He worked six days,
       and, the seventh, rested. The world exists in its reign over the earth here, the Church labors for
       six thousands years, the seventh is the Millennium. And all these mathematics (and) of the Bible
       are perfect. 13 And God always is on time. Sometimes that we are a little bit late, or (a little)
       thinking a little different, but that’s always done for a purpose. But God is always on time with
       His Message. 14 And so, today, I believe that we are facing a great something that the Church
       should know and understand, that we ought to know what all this is about, and find it in God’s
       Word. For I believe, that, if—if it isn’t in the Word, I’m just a little doubtful of it. But if God’s
       Word speaks of it, then God, no matter how indifferent it might seem to our custom of teaching,
       it’s God working out His Word. Many times, it’s contrary to our way of thinking, or maybe the
       way we have been taught to think, but we have to recognize the omnipotence of God when it’s
       performed before us. 15 Now let’s go back for a little while, in our minds, and study, just a few
       minutes, for the past few years what’s been taking place. I BELIEVE, AS A MINISTER OF
       THE GOSPEL, THAT WE ARE LIVING JUST AT THE NEAR APPEARING, OF THE
       SECOND TIME, OF THE COMING OF THE LORD JESUS; THE SECOND
       RETURN…OR THE SECOND COMING. The first time, He came as a baby. THIS TIME, HE
       IS COMING AS KING OF GLORY, TO TAKE VENGEANCE UPON ALL WHO OBEY NOT
       THE WORD OF GOD. 16 And we are believing, with all this great turmoil that we’re living in,
       today, as we look around on every hand, and pick up the newspapers, and just stand still, and
       drop our every day hustle-and-bustle of this neurotic age, and look out and face facts, we see,
       beyond any shadow of doubt, that something just about to happen. 17 And I believe that God,
       never, at any time, nothing miraculous, or nothing ever taken place, unless God foreshowed it
       by His Word. Revealed it, placed it, so that men who fail to walk in it, could…would have to
       stand before Him, and he would have to be…stand without an excuse, because God makes it so
       plain. That, if a man is concerned enough about it, he’ll find it, if you’re concerned. 18 You
       wouldn’t eat soup with a fly in it. No, sir. You—you wouldn’t. You wouldn’t be…You’d be afraid
       to eat food that didn’t look just right, and was contaminated. Because, you know, it might give
       you ptomaine poison or something, and would kill you in a little bit. And you watch about this
       body. But, that soul, you let it feast on things of the world, which you know is contaminated and
       can only do one thing, take you to destruction. No matter how well you treat this body, and how
       good of food, or how it lives, it’s got to go to the dust of the earth. But that soul will live forever,
       
       45
       somewhere. I’d rather eat contaminated soup than contaminate my soul with the things of the
       world, at any time. 19 The junction! God, always, before these great junctions comes, or
       ending off time, where He starts something new, junctions with the old, to the new, with one
       dispensation to another, He always shows forth His Power. Man, through the ages, always
       breaks down, and teaches away, and explains away, and gets away from the real living God.
       But, just before He junctions and enters a new dispensation, He appears on the scene, with
       great miraculous signs and wonders. He has always done it. 20 Look at the first destruction of
       the world, the first junction. After the world was formed, and God placed man on earth, the Bible
       said that they begin to build cities, great building programs went on in the world. 21 Look at it
       today. Jesus plainly said, “As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the Coming of the Son
       of man.” Same thing.

       62 I believe that the church of the living God is moving into a sphere now that’s going to shake
       the whole world. That’s the first time it’s been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human
       being. “Ask anything that you will, and it shall be given unto you, anything you desire.” Don’t
       you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled? Oh, it’s going to come to pass pretty soon. I’m
       looking for it to happen in this meeting. I’M WANTING IT TO HAPPEN NOW, THAT THAT
       ANOINTING WILL STRIKE THE WHOLE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, AND
       SHE’LL RISE TO HER FEET LIKE A MIGHTY MARCHING ARMY. The sick will be
       healed by a word; the blind will see; the deaf will hear; the dead will be raised up; and the
       power of God will shake the world with the church of the living God. We’re in the process of it
       now. I believe it’s soon coming to pass. I believe it will be just exactly that way. I BELIEVE
       IT’S GOING TO STRIKE THE CHURCH OF GOD SOON, AND IT’S GOING TO START A
       REVIVAL THAT’LL SHAKE THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IT.

       William Marrion Branham
       11 Now, if the Church of the living God, which is the pillar of the truth… God intended this
       Church to be a powerful Church, a glorious Church, a Church that the whole world could
       look upon as a—a Bride of Christ well accepted and espoused, and to live in such a—an
       atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that the…
       
        See, that maybe…God said it was foolish. He would save the world by the foolishness of
       preaching. He could of saved them any way that he wanted to! But first it’s the preacher, then the
       bible said, “How can they hear without a preacher and how can they believe except first they
       hear. Now, Paul also said, “Faith cometh by hearing.” Revelation comes by hearing! Hearing of
       the word of God. is, that right (Amen)
        Now notice here, the only way that you can be born again, is to receive a revelation from
       God. And I know this is misunderstood around the country! The new Birth was positively not,
       
       46
       and never was and never will be, the Baptism of the Holy Ghost! It’s not in the word of God
       nowhere. How can you be Born Again, except you have a revelation from God?

       62-0909M - Countdown
       William Marrion Branham
       36 There’s so many things that we could speak of here. I got a list wrote down that take me two
       hours to get through it, nearly, and Scriptures to back this up, like if you want some of them here
       to back it up. Like First John 5:7, shows the natural and the spiritual birth, and so forth, “water,
       Blood, and Spirit.” And three in Heaven, “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,” these three are one.
       There are three that agree in earth, they’re not one, but they agree in one, in the earth, that’s
       “water, Blood, and Spirit.” See, “water, Blood, and Spirit,” like the natural birth type it. 37 So if
       a man sets on the thought of “just justification is all you have to have,” he’s wrong, wrong. He’s
       got to be wrong. And then if the church who believes like the many of the Pentecostals, that the
       Holy Ghost is it, “that’s all, just repent and get the Holy Ghost,” that’s still wrong, because
       you’ve got to get sanctification in there to cleanse it before the Holy Ghost comes in. If you
       don’t, you leave out the Blood. See? And the new Birth, as people talks that the baptism of the
       Holy Ghost is the new Birth. Now, that’s wrong. THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IS
       DIFFERENT FROM THE NEW BIRTH. THE NEW BIRTH IS WHEN YOU’RE BORN
       AGAIN. BUT THE HOLY GHOST IS WHEN POWER COMES INTO THAT BIRTH FOR
       SERVICE. That’s exact. See? The Holy Ghost is…baptized into the Holy Ghost. 38 The new
       Birth, you have the new Birth by being believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. See? By having faith
       and accepting Him as your Saviour, that’s Birth, see, because you’ve passed from death unto
       Life. Now, if you want to back that up, take Saint John 5:24, “He that heareth My Words and
       believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.” See, he’s got Life because he believes. And
       that same group had to go to Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Exact. 39 Holy
       Ghost is power for service. So when talk about you got to be born again, and applying that to the
       Holy Ghost, many of the Methodists and so forth are wrong there. It cannot. It just won’t cope
       through the Scripture here. You get the thing sideways. It’s got to take it the way the Scripture’s
       got it placed out here. See? And the Holy Spirit is a… “You shall receive the new Birth after
       this”? What? No. “You shall receive power,” Acts 1:8, “after this the Holy Ghost is come upon
       you.” See? And they had already believed to Eternal Life, and so forth, but they had to have the
       Holy Ghost for power. “You shall be witnesses unto Me after the Holy Ghost is come upon
       you,” because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection, showing that you have become
       an adult in Christ. 40 Now, the natural. All things spiritual, all happenings and so forth tap, or
       type the supernatural, or the—the natural is a type of the supernatural.

       109 Paul was down here in the natural realm with his Ph.D. See? He didn’t know. He had an
       intellectual faith, but he didn’t have a Divine faith. There’s quite a difference in me having an
       intellectual faith than a Divine faith. There’s where you, my Baptist friends, failed to go on. You
       get the intellectual faith by that, BUT IT MUST BE A DIVINE REVELATION OF JESUS
       
       47
       CHRIST TO YOU THAT TAKES SIN OUT OF THE HEART. Intellectual faith is not enough.
       That’s all right, but it only brings you to the Holy Spirit. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS A PERSONAL
       EXPERIENCE OF THE BIRTH, THE NEW BIRTH, REGENERATION, MAKING A NEW
       CREATURE IN CHRIST.
       
        Brother Branham said on, “Christ the mystery of God Revealed” He said…And I quote
       Brother Branham he said, “Then pray tell me Brother Branham, what is the New Birth? And he
       said, “The new Birth is a Revelation of Christ! That’s the new birth, and that’s what he built his
       church upon. The New Birth is not the Baptism of the Holy Ghost! The Baptism of the Holy
       Ghost is not eternal life, it is not eternal life! It is only power for service.

       63-0728 - Christ Is The Mystery Of God Revealed
       William Marrion Branham
       230 And now the Christ in the Church is just being made known. The whole thing is the
       revelation of God, to take Eve back to her right position again with her Husband. Notice, and
       God is the Husband of the Church, and the Church is His Bride. 231 Now, Peter, when he called,
       said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 232 Now watch. “Blessed art thou, Simon
       Bar-jona,” says, which means, “son of Jona.” See? “Blessed art thou, for flesh and blood never
       revealed This to you. You never learned It from some school. But My Father which is in Heaven
       has revealed It to you.” Notice what He said to him, “Upon this rock…” That’s Peter, the
       predestinated Seed of God that had received this Light, and given the keys to the Kingdom.
       “Upon this rock of revelation of Who Jesus Christ is,” He is the full, manifested God. “Upon this
       rock…” Not a Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and Him being the second Person. “Upon this rock
       I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell will never shake It down, never prevail against It.”
       See? “I’ll build My Church upon this rock,” a revelation of Jesus Christ. 233 Look, Christ in
       you makes Him the center of Life of the revelation. See? Christ’s Life in you makes Him the
       center of the revelation. Christ, in the Bible, makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ.
       Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing, see, what God is trying to
       do. 234 What is the new Birth then? You’d say, “Well, Brother Branham, what is the new
       Birth?” IT IS THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST PERSONALLY TO YOU. Amen!
       See? Not you joined a church, you shook a hand, you done something different, you said a creed,
       you promised to live by a—a code of rules. But Christ, the Bible, He is the Word that was
       revealed to you. And no matter what anybody says, what takes place, it’s Christ; pastor, priest,
       whatever it might be. It’s Christ in you, that is the revelation that the Church was built upon.
       235 You say, “Well, I’m a Lutheran. I’m a Baptist. I’m Presbyterian.” That don’t mean one,
       don’t mean [Brother Branham snaps his finger—Ed.] that to God, not a thing, not a snap of your
       finger. 236 What is it? IT’S CHRIST BEING REVEALED, AND HE IS THE WORD. AND
       WHEN THE WORD IS REVEALED, IT EXPRESSES ITSELF. See? That’s God’s purpose
       for Jesus Christ, was to express Himself, to take His Own laws and live by His laws, con-
       …and fulfill His law, by death. And Christ, God, died in flesh, in order to condemn sin in the
       flesh, that He might bring to Himself a glorious Bride, redeemed back, that will believe only in
       the Word of God; and not swap It, like Eve did, for intellectual conceptions of man. You see it?
       That’s Christ’s idea. That’s God’s idea. The new Birth reveals this. 237 And if a man says he is
       
       48
       born again, and try to place these promises of Christ, in this last days, to some other age, making
       Him Christ yesterday but not today, then that man or that person has been in a—a delusion by
       Satan. And if that man says that he believes That, and it doesn’t manifest itself through him? 238
       Jesus said, in Mark 16, “These signs shall follow them that believe; into all the world, and to
       every age.” Casting out devils, and speaking with tongues, and—and all these great
       manifestations of gifts that would follow, that, “they shall!” Not, “they may be; they ought to.”
       “They will!” And heavens and earth will pass away, but His Word won’t. 239 So it’s Christ
       expressing Himself in the individual, whether he’s intellectual or whether he’s—he don’t know
       his ABC’s. Half the apostles didn’t know it, that’s right, but they knowed Christ. They never
       taken heed to Peter and John, knowing that they had been out of some seminary. They said,
       “They taken heed and noticed that they had been with Christ,” when they healed the lame man,
       see, at the gate. They knowed they—they had been with Christ. 240 THE NEW BIRTH IS
       CHRIST, IS A REVELATION. GOD HAS REVEALED TO YOU THIS GREAT MYSTERY,
       AND THAT’S A NEW BIRTH. Now what are you going to do when you get all that group
       together, where the revelation is perfectly in harmony, and God expressing it through His Word
       by the same actions, the same things that He did, making the Word manifest! Oh, if the Church
       only knew its position! It will, one day. Then, the Rapture will go when it knows what it is. Now
       notice. 241 You say, “Brother Branham, but that—that ain’t…” Oh, yes, it is, too. It is the Truth.
       242 Did you notice? Paul never knew Jesus, physically. Paul never knew Him. The only way that
       Paul knew Him was by a revelation, by a vision. Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—
       Ed.] Paul only knew Jesus by the revelation, just like Peter did. 243 Peter had seen Him in flesh,
       but he didn’t know Him by flesh, ’cause Jesus said so. “Flesh and blood didn’t reveal it to you.
       Even My Own life didn’t reveal it to you. But My Father which is in Heaven has revealed the
       thing to you,” that He is the Word of God, “and upon this rock I’ll build My Church.” Peter
       didn’t know Him by flesh. Man walked, and handled Him, and everything else.
        The Bible said, “Go up there and wait and ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost
       has come upon you.”
       Acts 1:8-Reference quote:
       8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be
       witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost
       part of the earth.
        The apostles had the seed word sowed into them. And then the dynamics of the Holy Ghost
       come upon that seed word and put it to life, it cast out devils, it healed the sick, raised the dead
       and preached the gospel into all the world.

       04 We have put too much stress on the Mechanics and nothing on the Dynamic. It needs the
       dynamic Power of God, the resurrection Power of Jesus Christ upon the Church, to manifest and
       to bring to pass that This is gasoline. It might be in a gasoline can; it could still be water, see.
       
       49
       But the only proof of it, is, put this Life on it, and It’ll prove whether it’s gasoline or not. 105
       And when you try to put the Holy Spirit in a denomination, you are as much as trying…You can
       get a splutter; you’ll ruin your engine, by getting it full of carbon. 106 But, oh, I’m so glad that
       there is a ten thousand octane Power, the Word of God and a Holy Ghost to light It up, and to
       resurrect the Power of God into a man’s life, or a woman’s life, or into a church. That shoved
       that Cadillac down the road yonder, under the dynamic Power of the Holy Ghost which came
       back and was waved over the people at the Day of Pentecost, making Him the same yesterday,
       today, and forever. 107 There was the first Sheaf come up from all the prophets, which was the
       Son of God, the King of all prophets. 108 There has been churches, churches, brides, brides,
       churches, brides, brides. 109 But there has got to come One! Hallelujah! THERE HAS TO
       COME A REAL BRIDE! THERE MUST COME ONE THAT’S NOT ONLY GOT THE
       MECHANICS, BUT THE DYNAMICS OF IT, MAKES THAT CHURCH LIVE, MOVE IN
       THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION. Until we come to that place, until we find that place,
       what good does it do to polish the hubs? What good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonize
       job, when there’s no Dynamics in it? No matter how much the Mechanics prove to be right, there
       has got to be a Dynamics to make It work. 110 That’s what He proved! Hallelujah! That’s what
       Easter proved. He wasn’t only the Word, but He was God Himself, the Dynamics, in the Word.
       That made the body of Jesus Christ (cold, stiff, and dead, in the grave) shake into Life and rise
       again, and roll away the stone. “I am He that was dead,” so dead till the sun said He was
       dead, the moon said He was dead, the stars said He was dead. All nature said He was dead.
       And now the whole world has to recognize that He’s alive again. He was not only the
       Mechanics, God’s Word, He was the Dynamics to prove It. 111 And as He, being the Groom,
       the Bride has to come forth, ’cause It’s part of Him. And It can only be the manifestation of
       the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride; It can only manifest. If it
       does something different from the Groom, it isn’t the Bride. Because, She is flesh of His flesh,
       bone of His bone; Life of His Life, Power of His Power! She is Him! As man and woman are
       one, and woman taken from his side; She had taken a Spirit, the feminish Spirit, from Him. The
       flesh from His side, made both Mechanics and Dynamics, the Wife. The Spirit of Him and the
       flesh of Him, and put it together, and made Mechanics and Dynamics. Until the church or the
       people… 112 All these Easter bunnies, and ceremonies, and big churches, and finery, will fail
       and pass away. 113 Until that Church becomes both Dynamics and Mechanics; and the Spirit
       of God, that moved Him, to do the things that He did! If He hit on sixteen cylinders, so will the
       Bride. Amen! For He said, in John 14:12, “He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall
       he do also. I’ll give him a charge of My Dynamics, in his Mechanics, that the world will not be
       able to withstand it; and I’ll raise him up again at the last day.” That’s the Easter Message, the
       Dynamics and the Mechanics, together! The Mechanics without the Dynamics, no good; neither
       is the Dynamics, without the Mechanics. 114 You can scream and shout, and jump up-and-down,
       all you want to, and deny this Word, it won’t do any good. You’re just cranking around the—the
       pistons of…Got the spark there to fire, but no gasoline to fire it by. 115 It’ll only work as they
       come together. Amen! So, one will set still, and the other One will go up. That’s the only thing
       there is to it. Yet, they both might look alike, both claim to be churches, both claim to be Bride.
       But One has Mechanics and Dynamics, It brings it to pass, of what He said is the Truth. 116 It
       just won’t move, no matter how good the Mechanics is, until the Dynamics come. When the
       Dynamics come, that Fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline. And when That
       explodes, it causes a combustion, and that combustion moves every motion, every move, for He
       is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That’s the resurrection. That’s the real Power of
       
       50
       God, Mechanics with the Dynamics. Notice, “It’s the Spirit that quickens.” It’s the—it’s the
       Spark that fires. It’s not the gas that fires; it’s the Spark that fires the gas. See? 117 “You can
       do nothing without Me; but with Me you can do all things.” As He is the Word, It’s the Father
       living. “Father sent Me, so send I you. As the Father has fired Me and pushed Me into
       everything, I do only that which is pleasing to God. Now, as He sent Me, so send I you with the
       same Mechanics, and it takes the same Dynamics to operate It. And these signs shall follow
       them that claim to have the Mechanics. The Dynamics will take Its place.” 118 Paul said,
       “The Gospel came to us not in Word only,” through gasoline only, “but through Spark also,”
       to make It move. There you are. It came to us in that manner.
        That’s where I believe the little Bride stands this morning around the earth. I believe the true
       Bride of Christ is gonna have the seed word sowed in her. And then the Baptism of the Holy
       Ghost comes upon that word and makes it act out and prove Christ.

       William Marrion Branham
       194 And a real Seed of God is an absorbent for the Spirit. All denominationalism is took out. All
       unbelief is out. And when the Holy Spirit comes into that Germ of Life that’s laying there, It
       produces another Seed, just exactly. Another son of God is born. Amen. Another amateur god,
       son of God! 195 I’m a Branham because I was born of Charlie and Ella Branham. That makes
       me a Branham, because I’m their seed. Their two agreements, with their sperm together, made a
       seed, and that made me. 196 WHEN GOD AND HIS WORD BECOMES ONE
       (HALLELUJAH!), THAT… WHEN GOD’S SPIRIT WATERS THE SEED OF GOD, THE
       WORD OF GOD, IT PRODUCES GOD. And it’s not the individual. It’s God, for (what?) you
       are dead. You’re not yourself no more. You reckon yourself dead, hollowed out, waiting for the
       Seed-Germ. Then what is it? It isn’t you no more; isn’t the man. It’s God in the man. It’s the
       Seed-Germ, like the beginning, spoken Word. It’s God’s Word made manifest in the man.
       Then, it isn’t the man; it’s a man that’s died. He can’t be a hybrid and a son, at the same time.
       He’s either a son of death or son of Life. So if he’s the son of death, get it over to the devil and
       let him kill it…Give over to God, I meant, and let Him kill the devil that’s in you, run him out,
       hollows you out. THEN, LET GOD PLANT HIS OWN LIFE IN YOU, THEN IT’S NOT YOU
       NO MORE. IT’S GOD’S LIFE, BECAUSE IT’S GOD’S WORD WATERED BY THE HOLY
       SPIRIT, WILL PRODUCE THE SAME THING. You see it?

       William Marrion Branham
       And that’s the way a lot of church members are: Come into the church, and you pat them on the
       back; they dress well, pay well in the church and everything, and almost take care of the
       preacher. All the time out to some kind of a social gathering or something like that, all these kind
       of things… BUT IF THEY HAVEN’T BEEN WITH THE MATE, JESUS CHRIST, IT’S
       JUST LIKE A NEST FULL OF ROTTEN EGGS. You might as well dump the thing out and
       
       51
       start over again. We need the baptism of the Holy Ghost with a conference with God to come
       in contact with the Mate, Jesus Christ. He’s the Mate of the Church; He’s the Bridegroom to
       the Bride. Come in contact with Him, and be filled with His Spirit, the Bridegroom.
        What is it now? How are they gonna hear without a preacher? And Faith cometh by hearing!
       Now, listen to this! Paul said, in Ephesians 2:8 I believe it is. “For by Faith are you saved,
       through Grace.”
       Ephesians 2:8-Reference quote:
       8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
        How are you saved? By Faith, are you saved! By Grace are you saved through Faith! See!
       Now, if your saved by the Grace of God through Faith. You’re not just saved by the grace of
       God! See where’s Grace at? Don’t you see the perfect revelation of God today?

       54-1006 - Law Or Grace
       William Marrion Branham
       46 Then through the offering of animal blood, only was a—a substitutionary under the law, until
       Jesus came, which wasn’t born of any man. No man on this earth was His father. He had a
       mother, and the mother was a virgin, virgin Mary, a girl about eighteen years old. And the Holy
       Spirit overshadowed her, being God the Father Himself, and created. The very One Who
       spoke the world into existence, just spoke. 47 You know, Sunday, how we got into it. When God
       speaks, it has to be so. There’s no way at all to get away from it. God says, “Let there be,” and it
       has to be. Nothing…The very Word Itself! And the Word was a thought. God, when
       He…Before…A word is an expression of a thought. God thought it in His mind; spoke it into
       existence. 48 And we have faith in our heart, the faith of God in our heart, and can see it
       clear. It becomes a faith, and then we speak it, and it comes into existence, the same thing,
       ’cause the mind of Christ is in the man. That’s what makes healings, and so forth. When you
       get that perfect revelation, just what you’re doing, then you know how to walk. That’s it, ’cause
       that’s the Christian walk. Now, but the blood of animals didn’t take away sin. 49 Then when
       Jesus came, being God Himself, manifested in flesh, His Blood was not after any other man’s
       blood. Every one of us, every prophet, every great man, was human blood. But this Man had
       Divine Blood. God, Himself, created the Blood cell. 50 And the—the person, you, come from
       one blood cell, if you’d ever look at it under a glass. I did, a few weeks ago. And—and the
       breeding of animals, so that you…or cattle, and tens of thousands of germs in there. And those
       germs, little blood cells, strike, and in this, in the ordinary human. 51 But in the…this place, God
       Himself created this Blood cell, without any act of man at all. And out of there come His Own
       Son, Christ Jesus, Who God Himself dwelt in, making Him Emmanuel on earth. That’s the
       picture. That’s what you have to believe, to be saved. And then Jesus, freely, didn’t have to do it,
       but freely, with the love in His heart for His fellow man, died on Calvary and shed that Blood,
       with the sins of the world upon Him, that He took our sins to Calvary, on Himself. 52 Now it isn’t
       what I can do. It isn’t whether I’m good or not. It’s whether He was good. I can never be good
       enough to make it. You can’t be good enough to make it. If you ever make it, you’ll stand in
       
       52
       the merits of Jesus Christ. I’ll tell you that now, ’cause there’s nothing else you can do. 53 But
       God transfered all of our sins upon Him, and He died. And because He died a sinner, the Bible
       said, “His soul went to hell.” That’s right. And while He was there, He preached to—to those
       that were in prison, that repented not in the longsuffering of days of Noah. 54 “But it wasn’t
       possible that He would leave His body see corruption, neither His soul in hell.” And on the third
       day, He rose up for our justification. Showing to us, that as our faith is confessed in Him, and
       we’ve been born anew of the Spirit, that as sure as He come from the grave, we’ll rise also in
       His second Coming. Oh, what a perfect hope!

       55-0501E - The Faith That Was Once Delivered To The Saints
       William Marrion Branham
       22 Now, we couldn’t go to the Old Testament. Because they wasn’t called saints in the Old
       Testament. They were saints in the New Testament. Therefore, we’d have to begin from the New
       Testament. Well, then the New Testament was based upon Christianity, which come from Christ.
       And Christ was the first ‘Ministrator of the faith that we should contend for, because it was the
       faith that He introduced to the world. Christ born, virgin born Son of God… John was between
       the law, and the—and the dispensation of grace. Luke 16:16 said, “The law and prophet were
       until John, and since then the Kingdom of heaven’s been preached.” And John saw him coming,
       just an ordinary man. 23 Now, let’s start right here with John. What did Jesus look like any
       different in man, in stature, figure, or whatevermore? Did He look like or was any different from
       any other man? As far as we have record in history or the Bible, none of it ever gives one day
       that Jesus ever attended school. Never did it says anything about His diploma, says nothing
       about His education. ’Course I suppose He had it. Being raised in a poor home, He probably
       didn’t get very much of this world’s schooling; He didn’t need it. Now, but His wisdom at the age
       of twelve just confused the teachers of theology. They couldn’t understand that how this Boy,
       twelve years old, why, would just unroll the Scriptures there in such a way and prove to them
       things that they didn’t know nothing about. See, they were teaching it from a intellectual
       standpoint, and Jesus knew it by direct revelation. And may I say this, my brother, sister, with
       all love in my heart, that the real true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is given by spiritual
       revelation, only way you could know it. 24 Now, look at Cain in the garden of Eden. Cain, when
       he come back to Eden, he was just as religious as he could be. He brought flowers and so forth,
       and put them on the altar. He brought the fruits of the field and laid them down. He believed in
       God; he worshipped God; he sacrificed to God; he built a church to God, just as religious as he
       could be. And Abel rolled him up a rock and made him a church or worship place. But when
       Abel come, he, by faith… Faith isn’t something that’s imaginary thing. I want you to get it.
       Faith is a direct revelation. See, if you only accept Christ as your Saviour by a intellectual, you
       haven’t got it yet. You cannot say that Jesus is the Christ, until the Holy Spirit has revealed it to
       you. See, intellectual faith, that… Oh, if I could only get that one point right now to go down
       home in every heart. I’m thankful for this place, position right now. See? Oh, if you can only see
       this, you’ll see the greatest thing you’ve seen in years. Look, not because I’m standing here
       saying it, but if you can understand how it is that faith is not something mentally perceived,
       but it is a revelation, a revelation of God, by faith, not intellectual, but by his heart. 25 Now,
       how would Abel ever know to bring a lamb? And he was taught by the same father and mother,
       and Cain was. The only way, the Bible said it was by faith that he offered a more excellent
       
       53
       sacrifice than Cain, showing that he was just. In other words, he was justified in the sight of
       God, and God gave him a revelation what the plan of salvation was. That was through the
       shedding of blood, not the offering of building churches, and coming with great intellectual
       faith, and saying, “Certainly…” Cain said, “God, I believe in You. Certainly, I will bow down
       here.” No man facing eternity could ever come falsely, when he knowed that his eternal
       destination rested upon him finding favor with God. So the man come up with a true heart before
       God and said, “Lord, I believe in You. And I offer unto Thee this beautiful altar, this beautiful
       church. And I bring of my substance, and I tithe, and I kneel on my knees, and raise my hands to
       worship You, Jehovah. Will you receive me?” Just as religious as he could be. But he failed to
       have the direct revelation. 26 But Abel, being in favor with God, brought a lamb, not beautiful,
       pulling the little old fellow with a grapevine around his neck up to be killed. It was bleating and
       carrying on. Throwed it up on the rock, and took a sharp rock, and chopped its little neck until it
       bled to death. But by faith he did it, having a spiritual revelation of what God required. You
       get it? Now, when they come off of Mount Transfiguration, Jesus of Nazareth asked His
       disciples, said, “Who does man say that I, the Son of man, am?” And some said, “Well, You’re
       Elias, and some say You’re the prophet.” He said, “But Who do you say I am?” And Peter,
       speaking right out, said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” Listen, He said,
       “Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona (by Jona, rather, his father),” said, “for flesh and blood has
       not revealed this to thee, but My Father which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, ‘Thou art
       Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against
       it.’” 27 Now, the Catholic church wants to say it was built upon Peter, the little stone. The
       protestant church says it’s upon Christ the Cornerstone. But look at the Scriptures; it wasn’t
       upon either. It was upon the spiritual revelation that God gave Peter. The same thing he gave
       Abel at the rock, the altar. He gave Abel spiritual revelation of what the plan of God was. And
       He gave Peter, not by flesh and blood, not by saying prayers, or going to church, but by
       spiritual revelation, “Blessed art thou, Simon, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee,
       but My Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you. Upon this rock I will build My
       church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” Now, you see why we have so many
       different denominations? You see why we have so much confusion, one believing this and the
       other one believing that? Because the spiritual revealed Truth has to come through God alone.
       The Word’s hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent. God said so. And He reveals it to babes
       such as will learn. So be a baby, humble yourself, and say, “Oh, God, here I am. Just make
       Yourself known to me. I love You.” God will reveal Hisself to you; He will make Hisself known.
       You see it? 28 Notice. Then when John saw Jesus coming, just an ordinary man, not any different
       in stature perhaps than the average man. He walked right through the crowds and nobody
       knowed Him, went right through the pool of Bethesda and all around. Sometimes they’d get to
       fussing with Him, the Pharisees; He’d just walk right out of the crowd. And they couldn’t tell
       Him from anybody else; they all wore beards and robes; so they all looked alike, no different.
       But John, when he was standing preaching, being the forerunner… As a little history of it,
       maybe true, maybe not, I can’t say. But said he was preaching on that day about eleven o’clock
       and debating with the priest across the river. Anyhow, we know he was at the river baptizing.
       And he turned and looked, and here come Jesus walking down the hill, coming to the bank of the
       Jordan. And when John looked, quickly he knew Him. He said, “Behold the Lamb of God,
       that take away the sins of the world.” Do you get it? “Behold” means “to look up to.” “Behold
       the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.” Over in the book of John he said, “I
       knew Him not (He was like any other man.), but He that told me in the wilderness to go baptize
       
       54
       with water, said upon Whom thou shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on, the same
       shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire.” Amen. 29 Get it? “Upon whom thou shall see,”
       revelation. John. Didn’t say the audience. John bare record, seeing the Spirit of God. John was
       anointed; John was given the privilege to introduce Him. John was the only one that knew
       anything about it. For it was given to John alone. And he bare record, said, “I saw the Spirit
       of God descending like a Dove. And It went upon Him, and a Voice speaking from this Dove,
       saying, ‘This is My beloved Son, in whom I’m well pleased; hear ye Him.’” Oh, my, there you
       are: spiritual revealed truth. Nobody else saw it. Or the Scripture doesn’t declare it if they did.
       But John bare record. It was revealed to John, as it was revealed to Abel, as it was revealed to
       Peter, as it is revealed to every believer here tonight. Something that you can’t, you can’t
       explain it. John couldn’t go on all the diagnosis, and say, “This is the way it was, and this is the
       way it was.” He said, “I saw the Spirit of God. That settles it. And God told me in the
       wilderness upon Whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining, the same is He
       that’ll baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire, so I know it’s Him.” Amen. That it settles it.

       7 I’ve never been ashamed and God help me, to always be man enough, to stand up and speak
       my convictions. For if I’m not, I’d be a traitor to Christ. I believe in the old fashion baptizing of
       the Holy Ghost. I believe that a man’s got to be born again, or he’s still a sinner. I believe it’s
       only through the grace of God that he’s called of the Holy Ghost. We do not receive the Holy
       Ghost by faith believing. It’s the free gift of God given to us by God’s grace. That’s where I
       different with my own church. The church that I come from, the Baptist church. They said, “You
       said you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe.” I said, “That’s contrary to the Bible.” Paul
       said in Acts 19, he asked those Baptists up there that was following Apollos; he said, “Have you
       received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?” Not when ye believe, but “since you have
       believed.” You believe first and the Holy Ghost is the gift of God (See?), comes to you. It’s a
       different… Here… Altogether different from being saved, being called out in God.

       don’t, by that. No, sir. “I once drank, and I quit drinking.” That’s a good thing. But that’s a
       moral thing, that you stopped. 137 But to receive Jesus Christ is to receive His Person into your
       heart. It makes you die to the things of the world, and Christ lives in you. See? You absolutely
       could quit drinking and still not be a Christian. You could keep all Ten Commandments and
       still not be a Christian. For, if the Ten Commandments would have saved you, Jesus wouldn’t
       have had to die. But Jesus died that He might give you everlasting Life. And that’s what it is,

       That’s not the new Birth at all. The new Birth that God built his church upon, is a Divine
       Revelation of Christ!
        And here’s the shocker today! A lot of us rest in the fact that they believe that Malachi 4:5 to
       be the prophet of the hour and that’s the new birth. God never built his church upon that! Any

        And Paul said, and this only “Comes by Faith!” Through Grace by Faith, see.
       You can’t separate Faith and Grace! That’s husband and wife, see. Faith and Grace go together.

       When you’re washed in the Blood of the Lamb (not by make-belief, but really the—the Blood

       way He saw you before the foundation of the world when He put your name in the Lamb’s
       Book of Life. That’s all He can look at, because you are redeemed from everything that was ever
       done, you’re washed in the Blood of the Lamb. Therefore there’s no gall in you, there’s no

       60-1204M - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       142 “Upon this rock I’ll build my church, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against.” 143
       So then you see why Satan is so against the Book of Revelation. Anything that’s revealed,
       spiritual revelation, Satan is against it. That’s why he’s so against the ministry today. Because,
       what is it? THE REVEALING OF CHRIST. 144 Let the church go on with its great
       denominations and organizations, and its little flowery messages and so forth. Let them go on,
       Satan won’t bother that. They don’t have no troubles. Everybody pats them on the back. 145
       When there comes a time that God, through the Holy Ghost, reveals Christ back in the Church,
       with the power and demonstrations of healing the sick, and making the signs that He said would
       follow the believers, come to pass, then Satan turns over in his bed. He does something about it.
       Until that time, Satan don’t care how much church you join. He don’t care how much. But when
       Christ reveals to you that He is the Son of God, and the works that He did you do also; not
       some other works, but the same works. 146 “He that believeth in me…” Saint John 14:7. “He
       that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he also. Do the same works, and greater than
       this.” Because, Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost, would be greater. He
       could not bring it to them, because the Holy Ghost hadn’t yet been given. BUT WHEN JESUS
       CAME AND SACRIFICED HIS LIFE, AND THE HOLY GHOST RETURNED, THEN
       THEY COULD IMPART ETERNAL LIFE TO THE PEOPLE. THAT’S THE “GREATER.”
       147 But the signs and wonders, Jesus plainly said, in Mark 16, “Go ye into all the world, and
       preach the gospel to every creature.” How far? All the world. How many? Every creature.
       Long as the Gospel is being preached, these signs shall follow them that believe. And when
       that becomes a revelation, brother, you’re near the Kingdom then. “On this rock I’ll build my
       church, and the gates of hell can’t prevail against it.” 148 Because, the man or the woman
       that’s ever been in that back desert alone, like Moses was, and the revelation of God be made
       manifest to him through the Holy Ghost, there’s nothing can shake him. He’s just as sound
       
       57
       and solid as he can be. Satan hates Revelation. He don’t like it, at all; upsets his plans.
       
        Notice here, we are saved by grace through faith. Now notice here, faith cometh by hearing,
       hearing the word of God coming forth from the preacher. Is, that right? (Amen) Then you receive
       revelation, which is Faith. And salvation is Faith! Your salvation is faith! Faith is your salvation,
       see! You can’t separate them.
        Now notice here, listen to this 15th verse. Paul said, “How shall they preach Except they be
       sent?”
       Romans 10:15-Scripture quote;
       15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of
       them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
        Now, listen to this! Now to the missionaries all over the world, and all the preachers and all
       evangelists traveling world-wide today. From their denominations and independent or who-ever
       they may be. From Jamaica clear to Africa, Finland or where ever it is today. Let it be known,
       that God means just what he said in his word!
        The Bible said, “How can they believe on him, whom they have not heard? And how can they
       hear without a preacher? And how can they preach…How can THEY PREACH except they be
       sent? Now, I’m winding down on you now!
        Now let’s see, if Gods revelation is right! See! Now what is the gospel? What is the gospel?
       Paul is saying here that they cannot be saved, until first they have Faith. They cannot have
       revelation except they hear and they cannot hear without a preacher. And that preacher cannot
       go, unless God sends him.
        That’s why…This is for me see! That’s why I wouldn’t dare'est go out on the field today and
       give anybody… What I’ve got to say about, that’s my business. I have no right, what-so-ever to
       go across the country and propagate what I think about it. Course if somebody falls in my way,
       I’ve got to stand on what I believe to be truth, see. I’ve got to stand on what I believe is the truth.
       But I don’t believe any man…I don’t believe any man, missionary evangelist or whatever he is
       has any right to cross the earth today and around the world and go tell what he thinks about Jesus
       Christ or the message of the hour or any other thing.
        Because the Bible means just what it said. How can they hear without a preacher? How can
       they be saved without faith? How can they have faith unless they hear? How can they hear
       without a preacher? And how can the preacher preach, except he be sent?
        Now notice here, there’s a great difference in bein called of God and bein sent of God! First
       God calls you, God trains you and then when he gives you the revelation of God’s word for the
       hour. Then if he’s got a ministry for you, he will send you.
        Now, brother sister when the people of this world ever come across the path of a God sent
       preacher and they don’t believe what he says, then they are lost!

       William Marrion Branham
       205 And the next day Something said, “Go back to the mountain.” 206 And that day instead of
       going one way, I was led to go another way. And I was standing there; and looking, setting in the
       front of me, and THERE SET THAT SEVENTH LITTLE, WHITE DOVE, looking right at me.
       I rubbed my eyes, I said, “Surely, it’s a vision; surely, it is.” I looked, and I said, “Little dove,
       where do you come from?” Just as pretty and white, could’ve been a pigeon; whatever it was,
       away in that wilderness. 207 God Almighty, Who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, Whose
       servant I am, and His Word laying here, open before me, know that I tell the truth and lie not.
       208 There set the dove, setting there looking at me. I walked around, I thought, “Surely, it’s a
       vision.” I turned my head, I looked back, and there he set there; them little, white wings, just as
       snowy as he could be; his little, yellow feet; and little, yellow beak; setting there looking at me.
       He was watching right straight westward. I walked around him like that, I wouldn’t touch him
       for nothing. I walked on up the trail; looked back, and there he still set watching me. 209
       Brother, as a son of Abraham, I consider not what the doctor told me, I’m going to be well,
       anyhow! 210 The third day I went back, I was climbing up high. And many of you know the
       vision about the Indian chief riding that little wall to the west. Something attracted me off to a
       big rock, about noontime, said, “Lay your hands against that and pray.” God in Heaven
       knows this is true. 211 I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and
       started praying. I heard a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, “What are you
       leaning against, over your heart?” And I raised back like this, my bare shoulders; naked from
       my waist up, hot. I looked back. AND THERE WAS WROTE IN THE QUARTZ, IN THE
       STONE, “WHITE EAGLE”; JUST EXACTLY WHAT THE VISION SAID THAT THE
       NEXT MESSAGE WOULD COME FORTH BY. 212 I was so excited, I run home; got a
       camera and come back the next day, and took the picture of it. It was still there, wrote in the
       rock: “WHITE EAGLE.” (DOVE LEADING EAGLE.)
       
        Notice, I know many preachers have said this and I’ve heard them, and I thank the grace of
       God never to let me get that rambunctious to say that. I’ve heard them get up and say, “I see why
       the Lord let me come by here! Now if you don’t believe me your lost!” Now that’s wrong.
        Now the true bride of Christ is not under obligation of themselves to believe anybody that
       crosses the world today, unless they are vindicated by God almighty. Now, that’s the truth!
       That’s rough on the preachers, but I just want to tell the truth, see.

        Now he said, “How can they preach except they be sent, except they be sent. Now notice

        Now the bible said, “That the gospel did not come in word only, but in demonstration and

        Now let’s say, the other two thirds of the world. And we know this gospel that the prophet

       all to You, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the results. Amen.
       
        But the Bride of Christ is the only woman in the world, that’s ordained to preach this gospel.
       And she’ll never be preaching it, until the power of the Token-Baptism of the Holy Ghost comes
       upon her and makes the word live. That’s why I believe Jesus told the Apostles, GO DOWN
       THERE IN THAT CITY AND WAIT THERE until the Holy Ghost comes upon you. And ye
       shall receive power for service, then go into all the world and preach the gospel.
       Luke 24:49-Reference quote:
       49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: BUT TARRY ye in the city of

        Now, there’s missionaries all over sea’s and I guess maybe we got missionaries over sea’s and
       around the world, in all kinds of different denominations and Church groups and independents.
       But there’s not a one of them that I know of that’s preaching the gospel, like it’s said here in the
       word of God. Unless they started last week and I don’t know about it.
        But how can they preach Paul said, “Except they be sent.” Do you think God would ever send
       a preacher that he didn’t go and back him up with the power of God? (No) I’ll agree preachers

       bein called of God, but where is the sent ones? That’s what we need now, is preachers that’s sent
       of God. Not only called of God but sent of God.
        I remember Brother Branham making a statement on tape and said, “Where would I send you
       today? To the Branham Tabernacle? It’s as bad as any of them! Where can I send you? The only

       that’s in Jesus Christ, God’s place of worship. That’s the place I’m introducing to you, tonight,
       where God put His Name. Where He promised He would meet every person that come in there,
       He would worship with him and feast with him, that’s in Christ; not in no church, no tabernacle.
       But, in Christ, He is God’s Tabernacle. He is the place that God came into, Himself, and dwelt in
       Him. “This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am pleased to dwell in.” There is where God
       tabernacled, brought His Name and placed It upon, Jesus Christ. Therefore, His Name was put
       in a Man, His Son, Jesus Christ, in which He tabernacled Himself, and in that Tabernacle.
        Where all this time that we’ve had for the gospel to go into all the world with the power of

       tapes out. That’s not the gospel. That’s not the gospel, because God never chose a tape recorder
       to do it! God never chose a track to do it. God chose individual’s.
        Again, I quote Brother Branham on that. He said, “God never sent me to build a

       18 Could you imagine people freezing to death, and I would paint them a picture of a fire. I’d
       say, “Look at the fire burning. Isn’t it warm? Look at the people standing around, warming.”
       But that’s only a picture of something that has been. You’d freeze just the same, looking at the
       picture. What it takes is that fire to be reproduced again for your warmth. And the Gospel that
       was in that day, it’s written in the Word as a history, a painted fire of what was. Accept the same
       seed that they accept, and it’ll be a living reality in you, that’ll bring you into the same
       experience that they had. Say, “Rev. Branham, is that the truth?” According to the writings of
       the Scripture, the great Saint Paul said, “The Gospel come to us not by Word only, but
       through power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost.” And when Jesus commissioned the
       church to go into all the world and preach the Gospel: Mark 16, “Go into all the world and
       preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he
       that believeth not… And these signs shall follow them that believe…” 19 Now, there’s many
       has a profession that they believe, and today in my church, as in most all of our churches, we
       class a believer as one who is loyal to the church, and comes to church regular, and takes a—a
       place, a position in the church, and helps the church in its financial needs. But that’s very
       contrary to what Jesus said. Jesus didn’t say, “These signs will follow them: they’ll take their
       place in church, and they’ll be loyal members,” and so forth. He never said that. But here’s
       His last statement to the Church. Listen. “These signs shall follow them that believe: in My
       Name they shall cast out devils, speak with new tongues, or take up serpents, drink deadly
       things it’ll not harm them. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.”
        And he said, “If the word is in you the dynamics upon you is the same thing that was done in
       me, it will do it in you.” Did he say that? (Amen) He said it!

       11 You don’t know, you don’t have to know the mechanics. Just know the dynamics, the thing
       that pulsates it, that makes it true, and see if it hits the target that the Bible promised it would
       hit in this day. See, it’s the Word again, back to the Word. 112 Now, the big machine is setting
       up now, and ready to move. The mechanics is already there. They’ve already got the
       mechanical system of an organization that’s going to bring, upon the earth, “a peace,” they
       say. They got a…like a U.N. The nations are united together. It’s a uniting time. I just preached
       on it, recently. The…They’re uniting together, to bring what? A world peace. They did that in the
       League of Nations. They’ve always done it, and it never works. It can’t work. The U.N. is nothing
       but a big rubber balloon that’s carried about by every nation’s wind of doctrine. It’ll bust and
       blow up at anything. It can’t work. Neither can the Council of Churches work. It’s an
       organization by man, contrary to the system…or with their system contrary to the Word of God,
       and it can’t work. “How can two walk together unless they be agreed?” You can’t do it. And
       how can the Christian church, will have to… 113 The—the Pentecostals, the Assemblies of God,
       and the—the great other churches of the—of the Pentecostal kingdom, and of the Full Gospel
       people, how can they forfeit their evangelical teachings, the very principles that they’ve stood
       on? And where they was raised up, to come out of those organizations and condemn it; and they
       have to forfeit their evangelical doctrine, to walk with men who disagree upon the principles of
       the Bible, and Divine Healing, and the Power of God, and Jesus Christ. “How can two walk
       together except they be agreed?” 114 There you are, that’s the hour that we have arrived at, and
       that’s the big machine that’s set up. Now they’ve got the mechanics. The only thing they have to
       have is Satan in there, with the dynamics, to force the marking of the beast. When she is forced
       down, then the dynamics is working. The mechanics is there. They’ve already got them. 115 Let
       me say something, too; this uniting time, to see churches uniting, nations uniting. It’s a uniting
       time of God and His Bride, too. And I say this with reverence and respect. I believe that the
       Bride of Christ is called. I believe She is sealed in the Kingdom of God. I believe the
       
       64
       mechanics is there. They’re waiting for the Dynamics that’ll take Her off the earth, into Glory,
       in the Rapture. I believe it with all my heart. Yes, sir. We don’t know how He’s going to do it,
       but He shall do it. He is the Dynamics. We just become members of the machine, of His Body,
       forming ourself into His image, and see Him uniting Himself with us, in His works, with His
       love gifts, as He hands them to us just before the Wedding Supper. And we’re waiting,
       watching for that. Their big church is to be united. 116 The Dynamics of this Church will be a
       refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the Headstone is
       coming down to unite with the Body. But when that Head and Body unites together, the full
       power of the Holy Ghost would raise Her up just exactly like that; even the dead, that’s dead
       in Christ, for hundreds of years ago, will rise in the beauty of His holiness, and take a flight to
       the skies. The Dynamics is the Holy Spirit. 117 And now the dynamics of this great regime that
       they’ve got built, this big machine will work someday in the united council of the World Council
       of Churches, which will make a forcing, too. Remem-…but remember… You say, “When that
       happens…” It’s going to be too late then for you. You’re already in it. Whether you want to be,
       or not, you’re already there. See? Notice, you’ve already got that spirit upon you. 118 In the day
       when the—when the—the winds of the Spirit is blowing from east, north, west, and south,
       persuading people out of it, and showing the people!

       resurrect the Power of God into a man’s life, or a woman’s life, or into a church. That shoved
       that Cadillac down the road yonder, under the dynamic Power of the Holy Ghost which came
       back and was waved over the people at the Day of Pentecost, making Him the same yesterday,
       today, and forever. 107 There was the first Sheaf come up from all the prophets, which was the
       Son of God, the King of all prophets. 108 There has been churches, churches, brides, brides,
       churches, brides, brides. 109 But there has got to come One! Hallelujah! There has to come a
       real Bride! There must come One that’s not only got the Mechanics, but the Dynamics of It,
       makes that Church live, move in the Power of His resurrection. Until we come to that place,
       until we find that place, what good does it do to polish the hubs? What good does it do to give
       her a facelift or a simonize job, when there’s no Dynamics in it? No matter how much the
       Mechanics prove to be right, there has got to be a Dynamics to make It work. 110 That’s what
       He proved! Hallelujah! That’s what Easter proved. He wasn’t only the Word, but He was God
       Himself, the Dynamics, in the Word. That made the body of Jesus Christ (cold, stiff, and dead,
       in the grave) shake into Life and rise again, and roll away the stone. “I am He that was dead,”
       so dead till the sun said He was dead, the moon said He was dead, the stars said He was dead.
       All nature said He was dead. And now the whole world has to recognize that He’s alive again.
       He was not only the Mechanics, God’s Word, He was the Dynamics to prove It. 111 And as
       
       65
       He, being the Groom, the Bride has to come forth, ’cause It’s part of Him. And It can only be
       the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride; It
       can only manifest. If it does something different from the Groom, it isn’t the Bride. Because,
       She is flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone; Life of His Life, Power of His Power! She is Him!
       As man and woman are one, and woman taken from his side; She had taken a Spirit, the feminish
       Spirit, from Him. The flesh from His side, made both Mechanics and Dynamics, the Wife. The
       Spirit of Him and the flesh of Him, and put it together, and made Mechanics and Dynamics.
       Until the church or the people… 112 All these Easter bunnies, and ceremonies, and big
       churches, and finery, will fail and pass away. 113 Until that Church becomes both Dynamics
       and Mechanics; and the Spirit of God, that moved Him, to do the things that He did! If He hit
       on sixteen cylinders, so will the Bride. Amen! For He said, in John 14:12, “He that believeth
       on Me, the works that I do shall he do also. I’ll give him a charge of My Dynamics, in his
       Mechanics, that the world will not be able to withstand it; and I’ll raise him up again at the
       last day.” That’s the Easter Message, the Dynamics and the Mechanics, together! The
       Mechanics without the Dynamics, no good; neither is the Dynamics, without the Mechanics. 114
       You can scream and shout, and jump up-and-down, all you want to, and deny this Word, it won’t
       do any good. You’re just cranking around the—the pistons of…Got the spark there to fire, but no
       gasoline to fire it by. 115 It’ll only work as they come together. Amen! So, one will set still, and
       the other One will go up. That’s the only thing there is to it. Yet, they both might look alike, both
       claim to be churches, both claim to be Bride. But One has Mechanics and Dynamics, It brings
       it to pass, of what He said is the Truth. 116 It just won’t move, no matter how good the
       Mechanics is, until the Dynamics come. When the Dynamics come, that Fire is made to
       connect with that octane in the gasoline. And when That explodes, it causes a combustion, and
       that combustion moves every motion, every move, for He is the same yesterday, today, and
       forever. That’s the resurrection. That’s the real Power of God, Mechanics with the Dynamics.
       Notice, “It’s the Spirit that quickens.” It’s the—it’s the Spark that fires. It’s not the gas that
       fires; it’s the Spark that fires the gas. See? 117 “You can do nothing without Me; but with Me
       you can do all things.” As He is the Word, It’s the Father living. “Father sent Me, so send I
       you. As the Father has fired Me and pushed Me into everything, I do only that which is
       pleasing to God. Now, as He sent Me, so send I you with the same Mechanics, and it takes the
       same Dynamics to operate It. And these signs shall follow them that claim to have the
       Mechanics. The Dynamics will take Its place.” 118 Paul said, “The Gospel came to us not in
       Word only,” through gasoline only, “but through Spark also,” to make It move. There you are.
       It came to us in that manner.
        Now, search around the world today, why is it if we got the gospel if we got the correct
       message then why can’t we see apostolic days back among us again? You say we got it, “Sister
       so and so got healed of a back ache” I’m talking about apostolic signs! I’m talking about the
       apostolic God, that was indwelling the people. Like they had on the day of Pentecost. Where is
       that around the world today? Where’s a ministry, like they had on the day of Pentecost? See!
        Now Paul said, “How can they preach except they be sent!” Now that’s a good question, isn’t
       it? Then how is a man, gonna take the gospel into all the world, except God sends him. How can
       he have faith in what he’s doin, except God tells him what to do? And he whom God sends, he
       goes in. And he goes before him and cuts off every enemy before his path.
       
       66
        Now that’s why that preachers go forth today and they got no power and authority because
       they know that God hasn’t sent them.
        And we’re a whole like the little boy goin through the graveyard, tryin to whistle. And his
       whistle is proving to you, that he’s not afraid. That’s why he’s whistling. See!
        And we’re trying to make this be the Bride, when it’s really not…Of course, I know the
       Brides here, but I’m not saying the Bride ain’t here now! But I mean for her to be the
       masterpiece made manifested as Brother Branham said. Why isn’t she manifested, if she’s the
       Bride? But why isn’t she manifested, as the Bride? You’ll never know she’s the Bride honey till
       you see her manifested, because that’s the proof of the pudding is thereof.

       was the original Seed. And She’s come through the process of these denominations, which only

        Well, why don’t we see apostolic signs and wonders following the ministry today? Why
       aren’t they taking the gospel into all the world with another book of Acts wrote behind it?
        And Brother Branham said, “They’ll write another book of Acts behind this one to.” He said,
       if this natural branch ever puts forth another branch from the original vine, like that come out on
       the day of Pentecost. If they wrote a book of Acts behind that, they’ll write another book of Acts

       34 That’s what the tree put its…forth its first branch, and that’s what happened. And if that
       tree ever puts forth another branch, they’ll write another book of acts behind it. Cause, you
       see, the same Life has got to be in the same thing.
        Now we got the Acts of one another and it’s a mess. But all the Acts of the Holy Ghost is
       perfect. How are we gonna get the Acts of the Holy Ghost? Brother, if you’ll ever… When you
       see a man of God that’s called of God and trained of God and equipped of God and sent of God,
       I’ll show you the Acts of the Holy Ghost. Just like it was in the apostles.
        How can they preach, except they be sent. Now how about all the missionaries that’s out on
       the foreign fields today, preaching without bein sent? Now I ask you, what good will it come to?
        Why Jamaica, is pounding the roads down with powder with all the missionaries they have
       over there for a while. Then they go down town and get themselves a little apartment. Send out a
       newsletter, you know. Get a few natives there to come in building and give them some rice and
       beans. I could go down there and build the biggest denomination down there that could ever be
       built down there, if I had the money to do it. All you’d have to do is give out rice and beans and
       they’d come by the hundreds. They’d say amen, raise their hands and praise God and do
       anything to get rice and beans. That ain’t preaching the gospel givin out rice and beans!
        Now can’t you see the word of Gods one thing…the word of Gods one thing and what the
       missionaries and preachers and evangelist do, that’s entirely another thing.
        BUT EITHER GODS IN HIS WORD OR GODS NOT IN HIS WORD! And he said, “How
       can they hear without a preacher! And how can they preach except they be sent!” I think that’s
       what the Bride of Christ needs to pray today, for God to raise up labors and send them forth into
       the harvest. And brother when he sends them forth into the Harvest, they’ll cut down some
       wheat. But they’ll never get the job done that God has required us to do today, unless God raises
       up men that are sent of God! And he who God sends, he goes in. And what is he? He’s an
       ambassador of Christ. And everything in Heaven is backing him, all power and all authority.
        I ask you, did you ever see one man, that ever stood before Brother Branham? (Never!) Did
       you ever see one enemy stand before Brother Branham, that God didn’t take care of?
        Did you ever hear about how a group of preachers had laid a trap for him, that God never took
       care of it? Supposing he’d went out on the field, before the angel of the Lord met him? See! It
       would have been a different story, wouldn’t it?
        No, he who God sends…Look at the apostle Peter! Just look at a little man that just waited on
       tables, Philip! And in the early church, was nothing but a man that waited on tables, see’ in that
       all the good he’s got distributed among the different peoples. And the next thing you know it,
       
       68
       Philip went up to Samaria had a great revival cast out devils, healed the sick, raised the dead and
       opened the blinded eyes! And made the devils scream and beg for mercy. Why? Because God
       sent Philip to Samaria! See!
        He who God sends, he goes in and backs them up with the power of God. He not only does
       that but he goes before them!
        As I think it was David that said, “Lord would you have me go up and smite the Philistines?”
       He said, “NO! Not now, don’t go up there now, but wait until you hear the sound. Wait until you
       hear the sound of the sound in the mulberry trees. Then I will go before you!” See, then what
       happen? David smote the Philistines. Well, who was it that smote them? It wasn’t David that
       smote them. You Pray tell me, how could one man a hundred and fifty-five pounds with one
       little sword in his hand, stand down there and hack down five hundred Philistines, with big armor
       and heavy steal and helmets of brass three and four inches thick? See!
        How could Samson out there…how could Samson out there with a jaw bone of a
       donkey…With just a jaw bone of a donkey, that had been laying there in the sun and was brittle
       as can be? As the messenger said. How could he stand there with men great warriors and giants
       of that day? Great champions of the Philistines, coming forth with helmets three and four inches
       thick. Not of copper but of solid brass. And that little man standing there and hit them men on
       the head with that jaw bone. And sliced their head wide open and the blood and brains gushin
       everywhere. And pile them up, ten and fifteen, just stacking them up like saw logs. Just pow! Hit
       another one. Wham! Wham just beatin them down by the hundreds. The Bible said, “And
       Samson killed a thousand Philistines”
        Why? Because Samson was called of God! Samson was sent of God! And anointed of God to
       kill the Philistines.
        Brother, you talk about Philistine devils’ brother they’re here till the sky and sun refuses to
       shine, from such demon power.
        As Brother Branham said, the lid has been taken off of hell and demon power is streaming
       forth today.
        And brother what’s gonna make the devil tremble today, is a church a Bride of Jesus Christ
       that’s called and anointed of God and set in position with the power of the Holy Ghost upon her.
       They’ll slay the devil again, like they did in days gone by.

        NOW THE TIME TO RISE UP AND SHINE, THE LIGHT HAS COME! And the glory of
       the Lord is to be upon the bride and she’s to be made manifested. She’s called! She’s called! And
       she’s to be anointed. And she’s to be placed! And when she’s placed, she’ll to be sent. How
       many believe that? (Amen)
        Sure! How can they hear without a preacher? And how can they preach except they be sent?
       Now I’m gonna ask you! How can everybody preach the gospel, that isn’t divinely called of
       God? How can they travel across the world, when they know there not sent of God? They are not
       preaching the gospel. You believe that? (Amen)
        Yes sir God… Brother Branham said, “God is obligated to his word.” We seen God’s servant
       come on the scene and everything he said pointed us back to the word of God. Back to the of
       God! Back to the beginning! Back to the beginning! Back to Pentecost! Back to the faith of the
       apostolic fathers.
        A lot of people today talk about faith, faith and they don’t know what faith is! The Bible said,
       “Contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints”
       Jude 1:3-Reference quote:
       3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful
       for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was
       once delivered unto the saints.
        And Brother Branham was sent to restore the word. That would cause the people of God that
       was called by his name to contend for the faith. And contending for the faith, is contending for
       the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that made the word of God live back there on the day of
       Pentecost. Contend for that same thing in your lives.
        And that’s what every assembly ought to be. Every assembly ought to be the power of God in
       action. The life line of the church, is the power of God. Not just a form of religion, but the power
       of God!
        And brother that’s what the devil’s tryin to kick out. He’s trying to get the Bride to receive a
       natural baptism of the Holy Ghost the natural seal of God, with no power and authority in it. I
       don’t want nothing like that! Why, if the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is no more than what people
       claim to have today, then what’s the use to striving and struggling to get that!
        Oh, I forgot, we got it when we believe. The Bible said, “After that you believed the word of
       truth you were sealed with the Holy Spirit seal of promise”
       Ephesians 1:13-Reference quote:
       13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in
       whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

       7 I’ve never been ashamed and God help me, to always be man enough, to stand up and speak
       my convictions. For if I’m not, I’d be a traitor to Christ. I believe in the old fashion baptizing of
       the Holy Ghost. I believe that a man’s got to be born again, or he’s still a sinner. I believe it’s
       only through the grace of God that he’s called of the Holy Ghost. We do not receive the Holy
       Ghost by faith believing. It’s the free gift of God given to us by God’s grace. That’s where I
       different with my own church. The church that I come from, the Baptist church. They said,
       “You said you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe.” I said, “That’s contrary to the
       Bible.” Paul said in Acts 19, he asked those Baptists up there that was following Apollos; he
       said, “Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?” Not when ye believe, but “since
       you have believed.” You believe first and the Holy Ghost is the gift of God (See?), comes to
       you. It’s a different… Here… Altogether different from being saved, being called out in God.
        And God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey his word! How are they gonna obey except
       they hear? And how are they gonna hear without a preacher? And how are they gonna preach
       except they be sent?
        And that’s the gospel! And then look here! And then the preachers that called of God, that’s
       trained of God, he’ll be sent of God. He’ll be sent of God! And when he’s sent of God, he’ll have
       the message of God. Because God trains him and gives the preacher the message of the
       revelation of the hour. Is, that right? (Amen) And then in Gods own time, he’ll send that
       ministry. And when he sends that ministry, he’ll go in that ministry and anoint that ministry and
       it’ll do the works of Jesus Christ. Is, that right? (Amen) And that will be the GOSPEL!
        Now what is the gospel? The word gospel, means good news. Now I’m closing in a few
       minutes now watch this. The good news, the good news of what? The good news of what?
        Now notice here, the message and the messenger are one. You can’t separate the messenger
       from the message. See!

       see it. The prophets longed to see it. They looked for this day. Abraham looked for this day, for
       he sought for a City whose Builder and Maker was God; it hangs right above us, tonight. John
       seen the Spirit of God descending out of Heaven, bore record, knowed that that was the Son of
       God. And, think now, He’s choosing His Bride.
        And we know that this message has got to live in individuals. God isn’t gonna make it live in
       donkey’s or horses or cattle. But it’s gonna live in human beings. The message is gonna live and
       it’s never lived…And the prophet of God said, “Until it’s made flesh!”
        Now notice here. This has been Gods way, that I’m speaking about this morning. How can
       you call upon the name of the Lord? “Who so ever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
       saved.” Notice here, this has been Gods way from the beginning, to get the plan of salvation to
       
       72
       the people for the hour that they’re living in. This has been Gods plan of salvation from the
       beginning. First, he calls the man! Right? Then he gives the man the message of the hour.
        Now notice here, we’re not to call upon the Lord with vain repetition. He said be not like the
       Heathen.” And just use vain repetition, but know what you callin for! See! Know what your
       callin for.
       Matthew 6:7-Reference quote:
       7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be
       heard for their much speaking.
       Now how are you gonna know what your callin for, except you hear? And how you gonna
       hear…How are you gonna get a revelation without hearing? And how you gonna hear without
       the right preacher? “Now take heed how you hear!” And what you hear! And who you hear!
       Luke 18:18-Reference quote:
       “Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever
       hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.”
        Now notice here, have you got that solid now? (Amen)
       Now notice here, this has been Gods plan from the beginning. Now just a minute, I’m closing in
       about five minutes. This has been Gods plan from the very beginning. From the very beginning,
       this has been Gods plan. See! In order for the people to call upon the Lord, see he first prepared a
       man, he sent a man! And that man told them, the good news. Now what was the good news? It
       depended on what hour you was livin in, what was the good news to you.
        Now notice in the days of Martin Luther. In the days of Martin Luther God had a chosen
       people upon earth. Is, that right? Now how was they gonna call upon the Lord, in whom they
       have not heard? And how was they gonna hear without a preacher? And there’s only one way to
       please God and that’s by faith. And how they gonna have faith, unless they hear the word of
       God? And how was they gonna hear without a preacher? So, God was obligated to send them a
       preacher and that was Martin Luther.
        And Martin Luther came and what did he do? He came and brought the gospel to them!
       Notice Martin Luther was called of God! Martin Luther was trained of God! Martin Luther was
       sent of God! And he came forth and brought the gospel, it was very weak, very weak. But it was
       still the gospel for that hour. He come forth and said, “The just shall live by Faith.” And the
       people of God were Born Again! They we’re born again, they never had that! (Brother Lambert
       pointing to the Statue of a perfect man) But they we’re Born Again. They we’re Born Again by
       what? For by grace are you saved through Faith.
       Ephesians 2:8-9-Reference quote:
       8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
       9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
        Now we got the Revelation upside down today. We got the Baptism of the Holy Ghost down
       here and the fullness up there. (Brother Lambert pointing to statue of the perfect man) I
       challenge any preacher, any man come to my house in a humble spirit and prove that out of the
       bible. You can’t do it! I have to many come try and they cannot do it. It’s a total impossibility for
       
       73
       you to have the Baptism of the holy ghost and receive the fullness here. (Brother Lambert
       pointing to the bottom of the Statue of a perfect man Faith) I’m here to tell you this morning, that
       the fullness is none other than the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. There is only three steps to get
       into the body of Christ. And that’s Justification, Sanctification and Baptism of the Holy Ghost.
       And justification is your Faith, and by grace are you saved through Faith. Is, that right? There is
       no other plan of Gods salvation, in Gods Bible.
        Now they say today, “Just believe and you got it!” Nowhere in the Bible is that!
       Paul said that, “After you heard the word of truth, you were sealed with the capstone. After that
       you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation, you receive the Holy Spirit.” “Grieve
       not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed.”
       Ephesians 1:13-Reference quote:
       13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in
       whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
       Ephesians 4:30-Reference quote:
       30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

       176 Watch that pyramid as it shapes up, the Church. Justification, sanctification, baptism of
       the Holy Spirit, and then that’s got to be honed out to when…The Headstone never did come to
       the pyramid, It was rejected, just like the Cornerstone. Now, but when that Headstone
       comes…I’ve been to the pyramid; it’s just so perfectly fit, you couldn’t run a razor blade

        A lot of people today, think Gods gonna seal an empty jar. But he ain’t gonna do it. God will
       never give you the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, the seal of God until you have Faith, Virtue,
       knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godliness, Brotherly kindness, then he seals all them virtues
       and fruit in there. And then he anoints that by the Holy Ghost and then you are livin written

       205 Notice how beautiful this is here, we was talking on it the other day. Watch here, here,
       “Therefore being justified, justified by faith.” All right, second place, after being washed,
       “sanctified.” And, then, “filled with the Holy Ghost.” Justification, sanctification, baptism of
       the Holy Ghost! You see it? How was His Message? Justification by hearing; sanctification is
       what you do; and in regards to what you did in appreciation of that, God sealed you by the
       Holy Ghost. 206 Now, you, my Baptist brother, I want to ask you something. You say, “What
       more could Abraham do but believe God? And God imputed to him for righteousness.” 207
       That’s all he could do, right here, He believed God. But God, to accept his belief, give him the
       seal of circumcision and sealed him, showing that God had to re-…accepted his faith. And if you
       profess faith in God, and has never been sealed by the Holy Ghost…Ephesians 4:30, if you want
       to put it down, Ephesians 4:30, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed!”
       And you’re not sealed until you have received the Holy Ghost. 208 How long does it last? Till
       the next revival? “Unto our redemption, the very Day of redemption.” There’s no way of getting
       away from It. You can’t get away from It, because It won’t get away from you. See? “For you
       are sealed until the Day of your redemption.” “There’s nothing future, nothing present, perils,
       hunger, thirst, death, or nothing, can separate us from the love of God that’s in Christ.” Paul
       said, “I’m fully persuaded of that!” There you are! There you are, you’re sealed until the Day of
       your redemption.

       2 Don’t forget now, always remember this, that these are the things that build the servant of
       Christ. See, faith first, then virtue. And now remember, the Holy Spirit cannot cap the building
       of God until these things are operating by the Spirit. No matter what you do, see. Those are the
       things that builds the Body of Christ, see, those things. NOW, DON’T FORGET THAT, THAT
       THIS HERE IS FIRST, IS YOUR FAITH. VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE, AND SO FORTH, IS
       TO BE ADDED TO IT, UNTIL THE COMPLETE STATURE OF CHRIST IS MADE
       MANIFEST, THEN THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES UPON IT AND SEALS IT AS ONE
       BODY. THESE THINGS MUST BE. Therefore, Jesus said, “By their fruit they are known.”
       See, fruit! You could not bear fruit without these things to bear it in you. And then when all this
       takes the place of worldliness and—and ungodliness, and so forth, then all unbelief is cast out,
       then all the things of the world is passed away, then there’s nothing but a new creature in Christ.
       And then Ephesians 4:30 says, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to
       the day of your redemption.” Sealed into the Kingdom of God! Now, don’t forget that. Keep
       that in mind now, takes these things first. Then the sealing is the Holy Spirit, the Cap that seals
       us into the Body. All right.

       262 Now, oh, man, here we are! Blessed be the Lord! Now we come to the Body to be the Bride
       of Christ, now to be His “flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.” Now, we’ll hurry up now.
       “Flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.” Why didn’t… 263 Ask you a question. Why didn’t all
       your rains, back yonder, bring the bride to Christ? I want you to answer me that. If…His Coming
       is overdue. We believe it. (Like it was in the days of Noah, longsuffering, He’s getting His
       Bride ready.) Why didn’t these rains…Why didn’t you Pentecostals back yonder, a few years
       ago, when you started, forty, fifty years ago, why didn’t you bring Christ, the Bridegroom, to the
       bride? Going to let that soak, a minute. Why? Because you pregnated her, yourself, with your
       denomination. That’s exactly what you done. He won’t marry a whore. He’ll marry a virgin. It’s
       flat, but that’s the Truth. You know It, in a flat way. You don’t have to wonder. I don’t stumble
       around about It. Tell you the Truth. Why didn’t it bring her? Why didn’t it bring Christ, bring
       Christ to her? Because she’s not fit. He found her in adultery. 264 Exactly the reason children
       don’t live forever when they’re born; Adam found his wife pregnated. 265 That’s the reason
       Jehovah had to take a Gentile Bride; found her pregnated. 266 That’s exactly the way Christ has
       to get Him a Bride now; He’s found the so-called group pregnated. HE’S GOING TO SOW
       HIS SEED. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET IT, BECAUSE THEY’RE PREDESTINATED
       TO BE A CHURCH AT THE END OF THE ROAD. 267 Like Adam and Jehovah’s, He found
       them pregnated with man-made doctrines of denominations. Like God’s Truth, in Genesis 1,
       “Every seed has brought forth after its kind.” So, when the Spirit fell on her, man had been there
       to her womb, and filled it with denominational seeds of his own thinking, so that’s why she got to
       be the way she is, and Christ could not come to her. Hum! That’s hard, isn’t it?

       66 Now let us look at some that has been quickened into this house of God, of their age. 267
       Enoch! (In ten minutes we’ll go, if you can just suffer that much longer.) Look, Enoch was the
       living Word of God of his age, he was a prophet. 268 A prophet is God’s reflector. How many
       knows that? The—the reflector doesn’t reflect itself, the—the reflector isn’t the reflection. There
       has to be something strike the reflector—reflector to make it reflect. So a prophet is a chosen
       vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he’s in direct line with that reflection, God,
       to reflect the image of Christ, the Word. See, nothing else can do it. You are a reflector, that’s
       the reason the prophet had to eat the book. That’s the reason he had to eat the scroll. He had
       to reflect that Word for that age. You got it? 269 Notice Enoch, God’s perfect reflector in type.
       When God was through—through with him, He just translated him, took him up. The mechanics
       that he had reflected become dynamics with the Spirit, and took him up. 270 Same in the days of
       Elijah. Elijah, even to his bones, where that reflection…Reflector of God in his body being
       
       76
       made manifest the Word of God. They laid a dead man on it, he sparked to life again. We are
       flesh and bone of Him, as long as we are the Bride of Christ. Do you believe that? All right. He
       died for us, and we died to ourselves and are buried in His Name, that we would “no more be of
       the world, but in Him,” of which both the family in Heaven is named after Jesus Christ.
       That’s Ephesians 1:21. For both Heaven…the family in Heaven. What’s the family in Heaven
       named? Jesus. What’s the family on earth named? Well, that’s the house of God where the
       Blood’s at. Is that right? That’s the door, that’s the gate, that’s the place He put His Name,
       and the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us. It’s the Word reflecting and sparking off
       the age that you’re living in. That’s what He was, that’s what Moses was, that’s what Jacob
       was, that’s what the rest of them was, sparking off that Word of God, the reflector that God was
       reflecting Himself. And come to that perfect image of God, Jesus Christ, God’s Masterpiece;
       was struck that He might take the rest of them for a Bride that’s been reflectors.
        Now notice here, in Martin Luther’s day Gods chosen was there. Right! (Amen) Now in order
       for them to call upon the Lord…Now you got to know how to call upon the Lord.
        As the messenger said…And we quote the messenger a lot because he was Gods man for the
       hour. Now, a lot of people that just offends them. They want to hear the message, but they can’t
       stand that. I think it’s wonderful that we can say that! We have something that we can point to,
       that God vindicated it today.
        Notice he said… And it’s worthy of repeating many times and we’ll repeat it again this
       morning. He said, “If I told you to go out in the field and get a watermelon and out in that field
       was yellow Pumpkins with the watermelons said, you’d more than likely bring me back a
       pumpkin if you’ve never seen a watermelon. And how in the world could people cry for
       something that they did not see? Now I can tell you about a watermelon but until you see, a
       watermelon.
        Now notice here when Martin Luther come, they didn’t know what Justification by faith was!
       They come through the dark ages and they was in prison, but in order for the people to call upon
       the Lord they had to have a preacher, see. Now notice what God done, he called a preacher
       Martin Luther, called him and trained him and anointed him and sent him to his people. And his
       message shook the world. Caused a reformation to break out. And then all the people that we’re
       elected of God, HEARD! THEY HEARD! AND THEY HEARD AND HEARD, the message of
       Martin Luther. And Faith cometh by hearing and when they heard by faith they were Born
       Again. And then, of course, they died and they were sealed away.
        Now notice, that when they heard the preacher…How can they hear without a preacher? How
       can they preach except they be sent? God sent Martin Luther! Then the people, what did they do?
       They begin to call upon the Lord. What did they call upon him for? I asked you what did they
       called upon him for? For the news, the good news that was for the hour. What was the good
       news? The capstone? What was the good news, Sanctification? The good news was, you can be
       justified by Faith! And then they called upon the Lord! That was the good news for them.
        Now we go past the scene of Martin Luther and we come to Wesley. The Lutheran Church
       got all organized and denominized and all cold in God. And we come down and what was it?
       Boy, we got into heathenism again. And what happen? How was the people gonna… that was
       called by his name, how are they gonna call upon the Lord and whom they’ve not heard, again?
       Because now he’s gonna do something different. Now they got to hear that way again.
       
       77
        Now what did he do? God sent them a preacher! What was his name? John Wesley! Now God
       called John Wesley! God trained John Wesley! God anointed John Wesley! And in Gods time,
       God sent John Wesley. Because John Wesley run ahead of the Lord and we know that. But there
       was a time when God sent John Wesley and he got the revelation from God. God sent John
       Wesley! And when he sends, he causes another great move of the spirit. And what did John
       Wesley tell them? What was the gospel he told them? What was the good news he told them?
       You not only can be justified, but you can be sanctified. Now they begin to call upon the name of
       the Lord! And then when they called upon the Lord, the Lord heard them and gave them for what
       they called for! And then God sealed them away, in that age. Not with the seal of God! But they
       we’re sealed away in faith waiting for the end-time Bride! All right, you got that? (Amen)

       32 After the days of that, came along Jesus. He was God’s Ensign. And He was lifted up. He
       ascended on high and give gifts back to men. And men received the baptism of the Holy Spirit to
       be made deity himself. Now, that didn’t set very good. But that’s according to the Word. A man
       or a woman that’s borned of the Spirit of God is a part of God. Amen. You are sons of God
       and daughters of God. Didn’t Jesus say, “Isn’t it written in your Scriptures, your laws, that
       you’re gods.” Not to forgive sins now, but you’re sons and daughters of God, limited to your
       faith. 33 And the very God, back there in the beginning that rolled the world, the moon, the
       stars, and made them from things which do not appear, or made them out of things that do
       appear. Out of things… And where did He get the material to make it? He spoke it into
       existence by His Word. He said, “Let there be.” And it was so: Deity. And that—a portion of
       that deity dwells in the heart of every borned again Christian. Hallelujah. Then what did He
       say, “Ask what you will, and it’ll be given to you.” There you are. Deity, it fell on the day of
       Pentecost. It’s still falling. All right. 34 And men are regenerated, made a new person, sealed
       into the Kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit. The life of Christ pressed into them. All their
       drinking and immoral habits, and everything go out. The love of God is like a Notary Public:
       takes a seal and presses it until the inscription of that seal is pressed in the paper over the
       signature. Oh, my. And when Christ signs your name on the Book of Life, and the Holy Spirit
       presses It in there until the Life of Christ is formed in you (Hallelujah.) becomes deity. Men
       and women are sons and daughters of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we
       know we’ll be like Him. For we shall see Him as He is, have a body like His own glorious body.
       And we’re waiting our perfect redemption. Amen. You believe it? 35 Our bodies are groaning,
       and we have an inheritance. And we’re children now, heirs of the Kingdom (Oh, my.), kings
       and priests unto God offering spiritual sacrifices.

       if that tree ever puts forth another fruit vine, itself, it’ll be like the original ones that went into it.
       Hallelujah! Oh, church will blend together, but we need the power of the original. We need the
       
       78
       Holy Ghost, the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That’s what He told us to do. 81 “I
       am the Vine, ye are the branches.” If a grapevine puts forth a shoot, and it comes out with pretty
       blue grapes, the next vine it brings out will have pretty blue grapes on it. If the first Vine come
       out, and they fell under the impact of the Holy Spirit, and they did great miracles, and signs, and
       sealed their testimony to a world…Even many of them with their own testimony, they, with their
       blood, they sealed their testimony. They went through all kinds of perils and everything to bring
       the Gospel. They suffered; they were beaten; they were punished. “Must we be carried home to
       Heaven, on a flowery bed of ease, while others fought to win the prize, and sailed through bloody
       seas?” What do we expect to do? “I must fight if I must reign. Increase my courage, Lord.”
       Certainly. We need a… 82 We don’t need a new denomination. We don’t need a new church
       building. What we need today is an old-time backwoods, sky-blue, sin-killing Pentecostal
       revival, that was borned at Pentecost and is back into the church again, the power of the Holy
       Ghost again, to bring Jesus on the scene. 83 The God of history always rises on the scene in a
       crucial moment. We need it. That’s what’s the matter with our church today. We’re getting too
       far back. We’re falling into the fashions of the world. And gradually, year by year, it begins to
       die a little and wither away. 84 It’s pruning time pretty soon. God will cut it back as sure as I’m
       standing in this pulpit. God will cut her back to make her bear fruit. He will cut the works of the
       world out of it one of these days. Such a disgrace, the way the church has carried on under the
       name of religion. 85 And we find out, when Jesus left, death set in. When Jesus leaves our
       church, the power of the Holy Spirit leaves our church, it begins to dwindle and—and die.
       And after while there’s nothing no more to it. Now, when Jesus left, death set in. Oh, what a
       sad time it was. 86 And notice, they wondered around, and they sent for Jesus, but He didn’t
       come. They sent for Him again, and He didn’t come, but He knowed what He was going to do.
       He knows tonight, what He’s going to do. It’s not lost with Him: He knows exactly what He’s
       fixing to do. He’s going to raise a people up, just as certain as I’m standing in this pulpit. He
       will raise a people for His Name’s sake out of the Gentile generation. He will do it. 87 It’s the
       Jews’ time’s right at hand now, and of the Gentiles are ending out, because they just went on
       out. They’re rejecting Christ; they’re rejecting their signs; they’re rejecting everything that’s
       called godly, and brand it as some kind of telepathy or devil power and do…They’re
       blaspheming the Holy Ghost and sealing themselves away from God. And God will take that
       minority, after while, and raise it up into a powerful Church, and then turn the Spirit to the
       Jews, and take the Gentile Church home. Exactly right. She’s in the making now. Well, we’re
       at the end time, nearly.
        Now notice, we come on down and we see that when you receive the gospel for the hour that
       your livin in, whatever that gospel is…And what is the gospel? It’s the good news. And the good
       news in the days of Luther was the just shall live by faith. The good news of the days of Wesley
       you can be sanctified.
        And now we come on down to 1906, that little one eyed colored man out there in California,
       God give him a revelation and raised him up and sent him out there. And he begin to preach the
       good news in that hour, that you can manifest the gifts of the spirit. And what happen? He
       preached that, he preached that so forcefully and so sincere and so honest before the people, that
       he got a group of people believing that! He got a group of people believing that! How they all
       gathered together in an ugliest ole run down, poorest place that they could find. They had a ole
       stove boxes and wooden boxes and little ole beer boxes and coke bottle boxes for benches and
       
       79
       put ole planks on them. And they would get down there and pray and praise God and seek God.
       And cry out and call upon the Lord for that thing that the preacher told them about! And what
       was the good news to them? You can manifest the gifts! And they begin to call upon the Lord for
       that and God heard the call and poured out what they were call’ in for!
        Now in every age it has been so, that God has never changed his pattern. God in immutable
       and he never changes. “There’s no shadow of turning, there’s neither no variableness in God.”
       There’s a lot of shadow turning in us! But there ain’t in him, we turn a lot but he don’t.
       James 1:17-Reference quote:
       17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of
       lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
        Now notice here, that the Bible said in this end-time, “Who-so-ever shall call upon the Lord
       shall be saved.”
        Now what happens, when God send a preacher with the good news, and you by a revelation
       receive the good news? Well, now you ought to know in your heart, whether or not you receive
       it. Are you resisting it or are you receiving the good news?
        In the days of Luther, those that received Luther received the product of what he was bringing
       them, see. God in other words, God sent the message. God sent the message to Martin Luther.
       And told Him what God was gonna do. What was the thing that he was gonna do? He told that
       and then those that believed it God honored his Preacher and gave the people what the preacher
       told them, see. Notice that they all got in unity around that thing that God said that he was gonna
       do for the people.
        Now notice, when you receive that good news… When you receive that and except that down
       in your heart and you begin to call for that, that’s your salvation! That’s your salvation! See!
       “Who-so-ever shall call upon the Lord shall be saved!”
        Now what if you did not hear that preacher, whom God had sent? What if you didn’t hear it!
       Let me say this, those people across the country, seeing they say, “they want to believe the
       message but they don’t have to say nothing about the messenger!” You cannot…You cannot
       have salvation outside of receiving the message of the hour and the message and the messenger
       are one! If you can’t receive the man, who the revelation comes through, then you can’t receive
       the message! It works together.
       Matthew 10:41-Reference quote:
       40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
       41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he
       that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's
       reward.

       William Marrion Branham
       And so is it today. The Holy Spirit’s moving among the people with great things and showing
       Himself, even letting it be known, and they won’t realize it till it’s gone. They don’t realize that
       God’s promised it to… You say, “Well, when’s He going to do these things?” That’s what the
       disciples said about John. They didn’t understand; they said, “Why said the prophets Elias must
       come first?” Jesus said, “He has already come, and you didn’t know him.” He can’t be one
       thing in one generation, and something else in another. He’s got to continue the same. 31 You
       look, Jesus is here now, and this is your opportunity. This is the day of salvation. Now is the
       time. Call upon Him. See? This is the hour. This is the time of deliverance. This is the time
       God’s calling out His people, not another time; now is the day. He’s manifest Himself,
       showing Himself. Then here we come tonight before this sixty or seventy-five people with a
       challenge that He’s raised from the dead. If He isn’t I’m a—I’m a—I’m a awful person. I—I am
       a deceiver, if Christ hasn’t raised from the dead and will meet wherever two or three gathers
       together according to His Word; then I’m found a false witness. And every other preacher is too,
       that preaches the Gospel. Can you get people to listen to it? Certainly not. Jesus said, “As it
       was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the coming of the Son of man.” They mocked, they
       scoffed, they made fun. So did they… Look at the people when Lot tried before the destruction
       of Sodom. He went and tried to tell them, but they said, “Your idle tales.” They wouldn’t
       believe it. 32 So He’s got to do the same thing today: a Message that’s truly unadulterated
       Gospel and Scripture, and the people have to reject it to fulfill the Word. Although no matter
       what He does, they still won’t believe. The Bible said that though He had done so many miracles
       among them, yet they could not believe it because Isaiah said, “They got eyes and can’t see,
       ears and can’t hear, that they might see with their eyes, and hear with their ears and be
       converted.” We’re living in a—a wonderful time for the believer. And we’re living in a terrible
       time for the unbeliever, because he’s rejected. And remember, the very thing that destroyed the
       world saved Noah. And the very Gospel that they’re laughing at today, will rapture the Church
       and destroy the unbeliever. [Brother Branham coughs—Ed.] Pardon me. How true. Now, we’re
       in the last days. When Jesus at the closing of the Gentile dispensation… I’m not a much of a
       
       81
       dispensationalist, but I know that there is a dispensation of the Gentiles. Jesus said so in
       Matthew 24. And now, the end of the Gentiles, I believe this revival that just struck is showing
       the end of the Gentiles.

       30 Don’t just come this far, say, “I believe the Message.” You obey the messenger. Come into
       Christ! You say, “Well, I believe every Word said, Brother Branham.” That’s good, but that’s
       just—that’s just being able to read. 231 Take the Message, take It into your heart, that you
       must have the Token, the very Life that was in Christ be in you. “When I see That, I will pass
       over you.” 232 As we see the great end-time signs on earth today, we know that that’s right. Now
       look, I’ve waited for this, for a long, long time, for this Message to you. See? And you’ve seen the
       end-time signs. And I’ve preached It to you, and showed It to you, by everything that Christ said.
       Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] You’ll admit that? [“Amen.”] We’re at the
       end time. I don’t see nothing left. 233 You say, “What about the mark of the beast?” Those who
       reject the Holy Spirit is already marked by the beast. The punishment will come later. See?
        Now notice here, now what if a preacher would come forth in the hour of Martin Luther came
       forth with Martin Luther and telling them they could receive the capstone? See, they could of
       called and called and couldn’t of got it! What if Martin Luther come forth…Let’s just say Martin
       Luther ran ahead of the Lord. And he come out and told the people they could be sanctified. Now
       what’s the point I’m tryin to make? You can only call upon the Lord, according to the word of
       God. And according to the promise of the hour, is the only way that you can call upon the Lord
       and receive from the Lord. Is that so? (Amen)
        Notice here, God said, “Don’t pray as the heathen with vain repetition, for the they think they
       will be heard for much speaking.” God don’t hear you, because of your long prayers! Or the
       nicest words.
        As some man said, “Rev. Dr. so and so prayed the prettiest prayer that had ever been prayed
       at the Methodist Church.” That’s right, that’s who he prayed it to!
        It’s not how long we pray, how many words we pray, but it’s whether or not we are praying
       and calling upon God for the thing that he promised to do in the hour. And that’s the only way
       that he can hear.
        Now notice here, notice here Jesus said when the apostles said, “Teach us how to call upon
       Lord, teach us how to pray!” Well, he said, “Pray this way! Pray, “Our father which art in
       heaven, hollowed be thy name. Thy, Token come! You say, “Did it say that?” Yeah, read it
       again, it said that! Thy kingdom come thy will be done! On earth as it is in heaven, give us our
       daily bread, forgive us of those that would trespass against us and Lead us not into temptation,
       but deliver us from all evil. May thy kingdom come thy will be done.”
       Matthew 6:9-13-Reference quote:
       9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
       10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
       11 Give us this day our daily bread.
       
       82
       12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
       13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the
       power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
        Now notice here, that was the correct way to call upon the Lord in that day! Is, that true?
       (Amen) That was the correct way! Now, that was the way Jesus said to pray.
        Now notice here, in order for the people to hear there has to be a preacher. And how can that
       preacher preach, except he be sent. Now when God sends that preacher that man, see… When
       God sends his preachers, that’s divinely called of God, he goes in them and goes with them.
       Then Jesus said…They said to him, “How can we do the work of God?” He said, “This is the
       work of God, you believe on him whom God has sent.” Now he said, not called, he said, sent!
       John 6:29-Reference quote:
       29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he
       hath sent.
        Now in order for the revelation to get over that God has for the hour that your living in, not
       only must a man be called, but he must be trained equipped with the revelation.
        Now notice here, God don’t send his man out on the field with the power of God and then go
       out there and make a mistake with his word! Why? Is because God only honors, Truth! So, God
       waits till the man is equipped with the revelation of truth. And then he goes forth and tells the
       truth and say’s, “Now if I don’t tell the truth, then God won’t vindicate it. But if I do tell the
       truth, he’ll come vindicate it.” And then he comes, don’t he? (Amen) Now that’s the way it’s got
       to remain! Whether it fits me, this preacher or that preacher. Let Gods word be true and every
       man found a liar. It’s got to be that way today and remain that way!
       Romans 3:4-Reference quote:
       4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be
       justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
        The gospel the good news came forth from preacher that’s called of God and sent of God.
       And the people of God that called upon the name of the Lord, receive the good news that the
       preacher brought for the hour that they’re living in. That was their salvation! And they called
       upon the Lord and received salvation. See!
        Peter said, “Who-so-ever shall call upon the Lord shall be saved.” And they were saved! But
       they had to call upon the Lord, for the thing that he was doin in that hour.
       Acts 2:21-Reference quote:
       21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
        Now notice that has been the gospel for each age. And those that receive the good news for
       each age, we’re Gods elected people. Now notice, that each one of those ages called upon the
       Lord, to receive the thing of which the preacher told them about, that God was goin to give them.
       Now God gives it but it’s your responsibility to get it and receive it, see. And then when you
       strive and struggle to work out your salvation, to receive the thing that God is doin for the hour
       that becomes your salvation. Then to reject that, is to be lost!
       
       83
        Now I’m closing, I want to make one statement in Genesis 4. Let’s start reading in verse 25.
       Genesis 4:25-Reference quote:
       25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said
       she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
       26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men
       to call upon the name of the Lord.
        Now look, let me show you something, not that I could show you something. But I mean look
       just to look at Gods word here. Now notice here you see; Brother Branham said the seals went
       right through Genesis. Go on right through Genesis even the seven seal was spoken of in Genesis

       back in the Scripture, all the way back, for each one of those Seals. The whole thing, together,
       the whole mystery, lays right here in these Seals. See? Every mystery of the Bible lays in these
       Seals. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit five times—Ed.] And the Seals cannot be broken
       until that time. I prove it here, just in a minute. 152 Notice. Now, the Book, remember, is sealed.
       Here is one, here It is, this seal. Then another One is wrapped, a Seal. Another One is wrapped,
       a Seal. It’s a Book of Redemption. And the whole thing, together, makes the Book, and It’s sealed
       with Seven Seals. And, then, it’s on the backside, is because it’s wound up. The Seal mystery is
       on the inside. And It only says, “The white-horse rider,” or, “The black-horse rider,” and whatmore, on the outside. But the mystery of the whole Book is in them Seals, from Genesis to
       Revelation. The complete plan of redemption is revealed in these Seven Seals. Oh, it’s an
       important time. God help us to get It! See?
        Now notice here, that the first born of God was Able. Of which the antichrist…and we know
       that’s working right down here in the end-time. What was in Genesis was a seed chapter. Genesis
       was the beginning. Genesis was like Pentecost. Only it was before, but still it was the beginning.

        Now notice here, Abel was the first born from God. Abel! And then notice here, that the
       wrong seed had got in the womb! The wrong seed had got in the womb, and it raised up a wild
       thing, that was contrary to the word of God and wouldn’t obey the word of God. Had no
       revelation of God! And that Cain antichrist, which was the false church the false anointed the
       seed of the serpent…That seed of the serpent that false anointed, raised up and persecuted Abel
       that had revelation. And he killed Abel!
        Now this is me, this is me! I’d like to type Abel here, with Pentecost. I’d like to take Abel
       here this morning to make a point. Just to make a point, I’d like to type Abel here because this is
       the beginning, Pentecost being the beginning.
        Notice here, that when Abel come on the scene, Cain was on the scene. When Jesus came on
       the scene, Judas come on the scene. When Esau came on the scene, Jacob come on the scene.
       When Isaac came on the scene, Ishmael was on the scene. And each one of these persecuted the
       other!
        Now notice here, that Abel as I say I’d like to type him this morning as a type of the
       beginning of Pentecost, the first born. Was he the first born? (Amen)
        Now notice here, that this seed of the serpent was already planted in the womb of the church.
       Right! And it gave birth, and begin to persecute the righteous seed. And what did it do? Just like
       the antichrist did after the apostles, it martyred and stomped out and killed out all the righteous
       seed. Did it, do it? (Amen)
        Notice here that Antichrist, Paul said, “The spirit of iniquity already doeth work right among
       you.”
       2 Thessalonians 2:7-Reference quote:
       7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken

       29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing
       the flock.
        And I know that after my departure, you seed of the serpent you grievous wolves shall try to
       enter in. They won’t manifest themselves while I’m here. But when I leave, this antichrist will
       come in among you and not spare the flock and will destroy you. Is, that right? (Amen)
        Notice here that when Abel-Pentecost was born, that ole seed of the serpent that Judas seed.
       Right! Come on down through the church with Paul there. And finally wound up at Nicaea, three
       hundred and fifteen years after the death of the last apostle in the third century. And they
       stomped out all that righteous seed. Like Abel! That antichrist killed them all.
        And then it went on down, to the last church age, where God had said by Malachi 4:5, I’ve
       promised you a seed! For God…Notice in the last age, had promised a resurrection of the
       righteous spiritual seed, like on the day of Pentecost. See!
        Now notice here… notice here that the Bible said, that after Abel was killed, Pentecost, see.
       That after that, a space of time after that, that God appointed a seed. God appointed a seed! See!
       Not a natural seed, but another spiritual seed. And notice he was the resurrection sign! And what
       do we get after the death of Pentecost? We go through the dark ages, down the seventh age and
       then God promises a little Bride, right at the end-time a resurrection sign, Seth! SETH IS THE
       RESURRECTION SIGN! See! And then what happens? We see the resurrection sign!
       
       85
        And I want to type that with Malachi 4:5, that went forth around the world seven times. And
       showed the people a resurrection sign! But you know a sign, when you see the sign you have not
       arrived to the object that God wants you to arrive at!

       of those that are good, having a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof. From such,

       64-0313 - The Voice Of The Sign
       William Marrion Branham
       172 Oh, they hated that Voice. What did they do? They put that Voice out from among them.
       They put Him out. 173 Jesus said, “If they call the Master of the house, ‘Beelzebub,’ how much
       more will they call His disciples?” 174 Remember, in Revelation 3, at the Laodicean Age. This is
       the Laodicea; the sign of Sodom is to come. The Voice, “Return back to the Word, away from
       these creeds and denominations, and turn back to the Word,” when It come, according to
       Revelation 3, He was put out of the church, just like it was then. 175 “THE SIGN IS ALL
       RIGHT, BUT NOT THE VOICE.” They don’t want nothing to do with the Voice. No, no; the
       Voice. But Moses said, if they won’t, or… 176 GOD SAID TO MOSES, “THEY WON’T
       BELIEVE THAT FIRST VOICE OF THE FIRST SIGN, TRY THEM ON THE SECOND
       VOICE. AND IF THEY WON’T DO THAT, THEN GO GET SOME WATER AND POUR IT
       UPON THE GROUND.” THAT SETTLES IT. THAT’S ALL. “WASH, DUST THE—THE
       DUST FROM YOUR FEET,” IN OTHER WORDS, AS JESUS SAID. SAID, “GET SOME
       WATER OUT OF THE RIVER, POUR IT UPON THE GROUND, BECOME BLOOD, AND
       SHOW THAT THAT’S WHAT SHE IS GOING TO BE DRENCHED IN, BLOOD.” So that’s
       just exactly what it was. 177 If they didn’t believe the sign, then THE THIRD SIGN REALLY
       GOT IT. All ministries has three signs, if it’s sent from God. Jesus had three signs. Moses had
       three signs. Noah had three signs. Elijah had three signs. Everything comes in three signs.
       Notice. Listen, friends. 178 It’s getting a little bit late. I’ve…Oh, my, I didn’t know it was that
       late, quarter after. 179 If you can believe the Sodom sign, of Luke, see, as He promised it; you
       believe the Sodom sign, then why can’t you accept the Malachi Voice that follows the sign, to
       “return to the Word”? [Blank spot on tape—Ed.] The Bible says so, and you see it, then listen at
       the Voice of the sign. 180 Flee the wrath to come! Don’t think, “Because I belong to the UPC,
       Assemblies of God, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, I have right to go in.” God is able of these
       stones to rise children to Abraham. Turn to the Word! Back away from your worldli-ism and
       your organizational systems, and things. God will destroy them from the face of the earth. He’ll
       sink them into the depths of the sea of forgetfulness, just like He did Egypt when He called Israel,
       nation out of a nation. WHEN HE CALLS THE BRIDE OUT OF THE CHURCH, SHE’LL
       GO THROUGH THE TRIBULATIONS, DRENCH HER BLOOD UPON THE EARTH.
       FLEE THE WRATH THAT IS TO COME, FOR IT’S AT HAND! 181 You can’t see these
       things without…I don’t know what you think about them. I’m only responsible for reading them
       and talking about it. Up to you! You can believe the sign, then believe the Voice that follows the
       sign. Oh, my! 182 Look, Moses, the type of going out now. He was to tell those people about a
       promise that had been given to the fathers. “I remember My promise to their fathers.” And now
       what—what’s Moses to do? To turn the hearts of the people back to what the fathers had said.
       And as Moses was then, so is Malachi 4, “to turn the people back to the Faith of the fathers.”
       183 All these scruples of denominations, and so forth, get back to the Word! I know you, lots of
       people like to do that; I’m not just scolding you here. These tapes go around the world, see,
       everywhere. I’m not scolding to you, but I’m scolding to whoever it is, where it belongs. I’m a
       Seed sower. That’s all I know to do. It’s up to you to make the decision. Flee the wrath that is
       
       87
       to come, people! 184 Don’t think because you’re Pentecost. Don’t think because your mother
       was a fine, sanctified Methodist, or your daddy a good, shouting Baptist. Don’t think that that’s
       going to have anything to do with you. Don’t think because you belong to the church that they
       built, or the church that you are building now. Don’t think because you Pentecostals spoke in
       tongues and danced in the Spirit, and run up-and-down the floors, forty years ago. Don’t think
       because you’ve had healing meetings, and so forth. 185 DON’T FAIL TO SEE THAT SIGN,
       OF A PILLAR OF FIRE, THAT GOD HAS A VINDICATED; AND THE VOICE BEHIND
       IT, TO TURN TO, BACK TO GOD. DON’T LET IT PASS YOU. THERE IS A SIGN AND A
       VOICE.
        The trouble with a lot of us and me to, I’ve been guilty of it, I jumped out of my car and
       grabbed the sign and said, “I have arrived!” When I failed to read the sign!
        And that’s why the prophet of God preached the message, “True Sign Over Looked” And the
       true sign was over looked by the people! The true sign was over looked by the people. A sign
       points you to something. And the Bible said that, “God will do nothing, except first he sends a
       sign” And he said, “When you see the sign, if you can read it by a revelation it’ll tell you the
       thing that Gods gonna do! Because he said, “I won’t do nothing, until I…”
       Amos 3:7-Reference quote:
       Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

       William Marrion Branham
       154 Now I challenge anybody to tell me, anywhere in the world, to these tapes, wherever they
       may go, show me one time that He ever failed to tell on the platform, or out in any vision or
       anything, but what was exactly the right thing, come to pass just as He said. Told every person
       just exactly what their troubles was, and all about it, and where they come, and all about what
       they should do. And every time It said THUS SAITH THE LORD to anything of healing, it
       happened that way. If you know one, let me know about it. I’ll go at the tape and find out. It’s
       never failed, in these twelve long years, or, fourteen years. It’s never failed, because it can’t fail.
       The sign was given by God. It can’t fail. 155 And before God give the sign, He give the
       commission, before there could be a sign to point to a commission. Before there can be a sign to
       point to a city, there has to be a city, first, to point to. If you’ve believed it with all your heart,
       you will receive it. “The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and God shall raise them up.” 156
       Now, I’ve leaned heavy on the signpost, myself. “Lord, You show me about this ’fore I pray for
       them, ’cause I don’t know what I might do.” How cruel that was! I ask the congregation to
       forgive me. The congregations of the world, that’s listening in on this tape, forgive me. I was
       wrong. I should have never carried it out like that. That wasn’t His commission at the first place.
       That was a sign pointing to the commission. I should have prayed for the sick, everywhere. 157
       Now, see, it’s right back again into the laps of the people, if you will believe that God
       commissioned this to be done. Here it is in the Word, it’s just exactly with the Word, the
       commission. And I say…
       
       88
        A lot of people say, “That brother Lambert teaches, that nobody’s got nothing.” That’s true! I
       want you to tell me what any of you had, before you heard the prophet God? You we’re Baptized
       in water wrong! You we’re baptized in the spirit wrong! And you had very little that was right at
       all, till he come. People better begin to thank God for him! You would of tried to get in and you
       didn’t have nothing to get in with! Is, that right? (Amen)
        Now notice here, that he came Malachi 4:5 came as a True Sign Over Looked! In other
       words, a true Sign over looked. Well, just take it for what it says. It other words, the sign was
       over looked! And if you over look a sign, you’ll CRASH! You go down the highway and the
       sign will say…
        I missed one, one time and I was doin eighty-five miles per hour. I was a sinner now! Only
       sinners speed. I was goin down the highway, goin eighty-five miles an hour and didn’t care if I
       lived or died! The devil said, “Go ahead and die” I said, “All right!” And I just floor boarded it
       and I was ready to commit suicide. I was running down the highway eighty-five miles an hour in
       this little ole convertible and she just left the ground! Went through and knocked down two trees
       and it tipped over on its side. And what happen? See! I really didn’t want to die, I was saying,
       “Yes” But I was afraid, see. But what happen, I missed the sign! I missed the sign, that showed
       me that there was an L curve! Just like my elbow. And when I missed it… Because I missed it, I
       run right off into destruction! I completely missed the thing, that the sign told me.
        And I don’t want to offend nobody…I don’t want to offend nobody! God knows I don’t want
       to offend nobody, that I want to be truthful. One day God will prove that I told the truth! Put it
       down with my name under it, my name under it. And if it don’t, call me a liar and then call me a
       devil. But until then, at least let me say what I want to say.
        And when God sent Malachi 4:5, the people rallied around the sign but was not able to read
       what the sign was sayin. They was not able to read what the sign was sayin, and they thought
       because you believed the prophet to be the prophet, that was eternal life. That’s wrong! That’s
       wrong! The New Birth Is a Revelation of Christ!
        Oh, they said …Jesus said to Peter and them, “Who do man, who does all these people say
       that I am, that’s following me and this supernatural?” And Brother Branham said there was a mix
       multitude that come out after the attraction of this ministry. He said, “When I done the
       supernatural, it caused a mix multitude to come out.” And just because you come out of the
       denomination, don’t make you the Bride! Everything in that net said, “I’m the Bride, I’m the
       Bride!” Do you think this brother is gonna say he’s a tadpole, a crawdad fish, a sea turtle? Every
       one of them want to be elected Rainbow trout! Do you think Judas said he was the devil? But in

       169 That’s exactly that fire burning, shaking it, culling, throwing the net in and pulling. And
       when you throw a net…Jesus said, “The Kingdom of God is like a man went and throwed a
       net into a sea, and when he pulled, he had turtles, snakes, frogs, serpents, everything else, but
       he had some fish, too.” That’s what the Pentecostal message is doing, it’s sweeping the earth;
       throwing it in and pull, we’re getting turtles, crawfish, crawdads, tadpoles, waterdogs,
       helldivers, and everything else in there. BUT WHAT IT IS, THERE’S SOME FISH IN
       
       89
       THERE, TOO. THAT’S THE ONES THAT’S THE MASTER’S. 170 All right, to some of you
       legalist-believing brethren on this tape, would like to burn it: When did they become fish? When
       the net went over them? They were fish in the beginning! That’s right. Elected from the
       foundation of the world! They just never come into the Master’s use. 171 That’s your frog. You
       take an old frog and throw him up on the bank, just “whop, whop” right back to the water. 172
       And the ol’ crawfish sitting there, say, “Aha, that’s a bunch of holy-rollers.” There he goes back,
       “Ah—ah—ah—ah—ah. Oh, no!” Right back to the mud as hard as he can go. That’s right. 173
       The ol’ snake hissing along a little bit, “I believe the days of miracles is past, Doctor So-and-so
       and So-and-so told me.” Said, “Ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah—ah, you can’t fool me!” There she
       goes, right over there again, you see. 174 Snake, to begin with! Frog, to begin with! Paul said in
       the Bible, them kind, he said, “They went out from us because they wasn’t of us to start with.”

       129 Jesus said, “The Kingdom of God is likened to a man went to the sea, with a net in his
       hand. He throwed the net out, in, he pulled it in. That was the Gospel. In there they had
       turtles, water bugs, serpents, green frogs, snakes, everything else. And he had some fish in
       there! Hallelujah! 130 The first thing you know, when the revival’s over, and the Gospel net
       comes off, the old turtle said, “I knowed there wasn’t nothing to It.” The old water bug said, “I
       believe it, also,” right back to the…hog, right to its wallow. The serpent say, “I didn’t believe It,
       in the first place.” 131 But there’s some fish there, too! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! It’s time for
       ministers to throw the Gospel net, pull it in. God knows what’s fish. He was a turtle, to begin
       with; and he was a fish, to begin with. God knows which is which, I don’t. It’s my business to
       throw the net in the stream, pull them up, say, “Here they are, Lord.” Hallelujah! Amen. Sure, it
       is, that’s the Gospel net.
        And the net the gospel of Malachi 4:5, swings the net over a multitude of people and pulls
       them out of denominations. Then out of that mix multitude that believe the prophet, COMES
       FORTH A BRIDE! That thing is not the Bride, but out of that comes the bride. Search it out and

       3 And I said, “Surely, there is something in this Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, that
       some character in there that You dealt with, would be on the same basis that would be my
       question. If somebody done something, and—and You got after him about it, then let me turn to
       that place in the Bible. And if somebody, whatever they done, it’ll lean my way. Where I’ve done
       wrong, or something You want me to do, or haven’t done, let me see some character in the Bible
       like that.” 94 And I closed my eyes, just let the Bible fall open, put my finger on a Scripture,
       Genesis 24:7. Eliezer, Abraham’s faithful servant, the model servant of the Bible, being sent to
       
       90
       hunt the bride for Isaac. CHILLS RUN OVER ME. SURE, THAT’S MY…THAT’S RIGHT
       WITH THE REST OF MY MESSAGE, PULLING OUT THE BRIDE. 95 He said, “Sware
       that you’ll not take a bride out of these, but go to my own people.” He said, “What if the woman
       won’t come with me?” 96 Said, “Then you’re free of this oath.” He said, “And the God of
       Heaven will send His Angel before you, to direct you.” He went right straight out and begin
       praying, and he met the beautiful Rebekah that become the bride of Isaac. 97 JUST A
       PERFECT MESSAGE, BACK TO THE WORD, “GO GET THAT BRIDE!” THAT’S A
       DUTY. THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR. THAT’S WHAT I’M TRYING TO DO, IS CALL
       OUT A BRIDE. 98 Remember in California there, that interview of the Bride, preview, I had it
       here. How that Bride come up first, and seen Her go by. Then here come Miss America, Miss
       Asia, and all, oh, the awfulest looking thing! And then the same Bride passed by again. One of
       them got out of step, and I was getting Her back in step; two of them, it was. AND THAT’S
       WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, KEEP THAT BRIDE IN STEP, HUNT THAT MAN. 99 I
       said, “God, I’m going back home, renew my vows again, and start out anew.” So that’s what
       we’re planning on doing, THAT’S WHAT I’M HERE FOR.
        Now notice this see, when Brother Branham done the supernatural, he said it brought every
       kind of foul and wicked spirit out after it. And we know that’s around the message today. You
       got every foul and wicked spirit. Hundreds of different interpretations of Brother Branham.
       Everybody has got their own interpretation to it. And the Bible said, the word of God is of no

       104 In that day, He spoke by the prophets, but this day through His Son. That was the word of
       a prophet, there. This is the Word of the Son, today. Oh, blessed be the Name of the Lord! 105
       In other words, if you’re looking at the shadow, the negative, you might make a mistake. But
       This is developed, the picture is clear. That was by the prophet; this is by His Son. That was by
       a negative; this is by a positive. Amen. You see it? There isn’t a chance to lose. It’s a positive
       thing, this day through His Son. Oh, how wonderful! …whom he has appointed heir…(oh,
       my)…heir of all things,… 106 What was it? It was an appointment. Oh, listen. He was
       appointed, Christ was, heir of all things. Oh, the devil knowed that, from the garden of Eden,
       you see, when the devil heard that Word there that day, in the judgment of those people. Said,
       “Because you come from the dust; dust you’ll return; and the woman’s Seed shall bruise the
       serpent’s head.” A promised Seed. 107 Satan constantly watched for that Seed. When Abel was
       born, he said, “There you are, that’s the seed.” And he killed Abel. His son, Cain, killed Abel.
       And as soon as Abel died, he said, “I got the seed.” He slew it. He said, “I got it.” But, Abel’s
       death, Seth’s birth was the resurrection again. Watch how they come down. 108 That line of
       Seth, it come down, a humble, righteous man; on down through Enoch; on down to Noah, to
       the end of the antediluvian destruction.
        Now notice, that the sign that Brother Branham done was none other than the Baptism of the

       the prophet. You didn’t even know what it was! You thought it was speaking in tongues, until he
       cut the props out from under you on it. You thought it was speaking in tongues! But it’s not he
       that hath a tongue, let him hear, Huh! No, he that hath an ear! Not he that hath a tongue. If

       And the trouble of it is, instead of trying to get the Holy Ghost, they’re trying to speak in tongues.
       412 And a lot of them speak in tongues, and is ashamed to come to this church to be prayed for;
       wants me to come to their house and pray for them. You call that the Holy Ghost? That’s
       speaking in tongues, but not the Holy Ghost. See? 413 Now, I believe the Holy Ghost speaks in
       tongues. You know I believe that, see. But there’s a counterfeit to It, too. Yes, sir. The—the

       61-1112 - A True Sign That's Overlooked
       William Marrion Branham
       201 What if that people at Pentecost would have went up there and said, “Now, Jesus
       commanded us that we should go up here and stay till we receive power from on High. Now,
       brethren, we’ve been here nine days, already. Let us accept it, by faith. Now, we have the Holy
       Ghost. We go out, because we’ve been here. We done what Jesus told us to do”? There had
       never been no experience. 202 Let me tell you something. I know this is on tape, but here it
       comes, anyhow. Listen. I’m going to tell you something. It’s a shame. People trying to…I’ve
       never believed that the Holy Ghost was “shaking.” I’ve never believed that the Holy Ghost was
       “evidence of speaking in tongues, or crying, or shouting.” Them is emotional sensations. I
       believe the Holy Ghost can do that. BUT THE HOLY GHOST IS TABERNACLING DEITY. I
       BELIEVE A GREAT BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT CLAIM TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST
       DON’T KNOW ONE THING ABOUT IT. You meet God. How? The Day of Pentecost! 203
       They said now, like the Baptists today, the Presbyterian and Methodists. I ask, “Do you believe
       you got the…” 204 “Oh, yes, we accept It, by faith.” By faith, nothing! That isn’t It. It’s a
       sensation. 205 You like to see a sunset. You stand and watch the sun go down, and cry, and tears
       run down. That ain’t God. That’s emotion, from something that’s in you. You hear of somebody
       being sick, or someone dying, you scream out and cry. That’s not God. That’s human emotion.
       How God… 206 I’ve seen people at a ball game, get so happy they’d stammer their lips,
       everything else. Don’t tell me. WE’RE IN A NEED OF REVIVAL, A SALVATION. And the
       Pentecostals come around, get the people worked up, and tell them, “When they speak in
       tongues, they got the Holy Ghost.” And some of them live all kinds of lives, afterwards. Listen,
       brother. At the Day of Pentecost, it wasn’t so. They never relied upon any tongues or anything.
       While they were there, standing in one place, in one accord, God came down, literally, among
       them. They saw, on each one of them, licks of Fire, about like that, hanging above their head.
       God was there. It was no, “Accept it by faith, or some emotion.” They were filled with the Holy
       Ghost, and then went out and begin to speak with tongues. But, first, they met God. THAT’S
       WHAT’S THE MATTER TODAY. PEOPLE GET WORKED UP AND EXCITED,
       EMOTION, AND IT’S NOT THE HOLY GHOST. THE HOLY GHOST IS
       TABERNACLING DEITY. Your words is His Words. Tell you, what we need today, is a call.

        And when you find the sign, you don’t find the object. The sign is only to point you to

       they did on the day of Pentecost!
        And if you received it, when you believed you got it different then the hundred and twenty
       got it. Because they got it after they believed and they had power to prove it to.
        I often said, “How much results” …I had good results preaching this message. I have good
       results wherever I go preaching…But I don’t go nowhere, but preaching for Brother Ruddell.
       And I find good results in preaching this revelation. Because I don’t believe that I would have
       any results, of preaching the message I’m preaching, if I would of went down to the hundred and
       twenty, two days after the spirit fell at Pentecost. What if I would of went down there…Now Do
       you think I would of went down there and said, “Now, you haven’t got it, you know you haven’t
       got it” Oh they would of tarred and feathered me right out of town. I can have results preaching

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 1 - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       Satan knows he is going to be exposed, and the most peculiar changes come over the peoples’
       countenances. Satan is afraid. He knows that the Spirit of God is about to let the people know
       of his works. That is why he hates these meetings so much. When names are called and diseases
       revealed, Satan hates it. Now what is this? It is not mind reading, it is not telepathy, nor is it
       witchcraft. It is a REVELATION by the Holy Ghost. That is the only way I can know it. Of
       course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost. Let me show you another
       reason why Satan hates this Book of the Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church. He knows
       that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever, and He changes not. He knows
       that a whole lot more than do ninety percent of the theologians. He knows that since God is
       immutable in His nature, then He is just as immutable in His ways. Thus Satan knows assuredly
       that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God (Mark 16 in action) is the True
       Church that Jesus claims as His own. All else is false. It has to be. Now remember this. Christ in
       the True Church is a continuation of the Book of Acts. But the Book of Revelation shows how
       that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm, formal
       and powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works (attempted destruction of God’s people and
       the discrediting of God’s Word) right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He fights
       that. He cannot stand it. HE KNOWS THAT IF THE PEOPLE GET THE TRUE
       REVELATION OF THE TRUE CHURCH AND WHAT SHE IS, WHAT SHE STANDS FOR
       AND THAT SHE CAN DO THE GREATER WORKS, SHE WILL BE AN INVINCIBLE
       ARMY. If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian
       church, and by God’s Spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless
       before her. He will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to
       gain power over Him in the desert. Yes, Satan hates revelation. But we love it. With true
       revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail over
       them.
        He said, wow unto you down there that say your filled with it. But I say unto you that you are
       wretched, your miserable, your poor and your blind and YOUR NAKED AND YOU DON’T
       HAVE IT! See! I got more scriptures to prove it, then you got the other way.

       49 Each time He appeared on the earth, at the end of an age, He always sent a man and
       anoint him with the Holy Ghost, Christ. The Holy Ghost is Christ, “the anointed,” the Logos,
       and It went out, and It comes to identify the—the Words of that age. “The Word of the Lord
       comes to the prophets,” the Bible said so, and identifies that age. See, He does nothing outside
       of man. Now He can’t do it in a group. You can’t do it. It just never has been done. He never
       did use a group; never did. He uses one single person. You’re not… 50 Israel was saved as a
       nation, but you’re going to be saved as an individual. 51 And one person He deals with. He had
       a…He didn’t even have a—a—a Moses and Elijah, the same time. He couldn’t have Elijah and
       Elias, the same time. He couldn’t have John and Jesus, the same time. He has always got one,
       because He gets that one person into His Divine will.

       12 However, God always makes a—a way for His Church. When He’s finished with one man,
       He has another one waiting. And God takes His man, but never His Spirit. He always got
       somebody else He can put His Spirit on. And it’s strange, but through the Bible, He never had
       two prophets, major prophets in operation at the same time. He always had one prophet. Then
       when He got through with that one, He—taken him away and put another one in his place.
        So, people say, “Oh God was doin all this and that, oh it was just this and that God was doin”
       Come to find out he wasn’t. You we’re Baptized in water wrong, baptized in the spirit wrong,
       everything about you honey… Everything about us we had it all wrong. How many admit you
       had it all wrong? (Amen)

       even know that he was the word of God! Much less know, that he was the manifested word of
       God, that discerns the secrets of the heart. Why? Because we had not even SEEN THE SIGN OF
       THE MESSIAH, until Malachi 4:5 came with the sign of the Messiah. And what was the sign of
       the Messiah? THE TRUE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST! That’s Gods message of the

       time of it, you see. And it’s a… 10 Now I’m sure, or hope, that you got what the Token meant.
       See? The Token is the sign that the Blood has been applied. That, the price that’s been asked,
       required of God, Jesus paid that price by shedding His Own Blood. He did that. Then, from His
       life came the Holy Spirit. And when the Blood is applied to you, the Holy Spirit is a Token that
       your price is paid; God has received you, and that’s the Token. Remember, that is the Token.
       Now, there is many people who doesn’t, they—they don’t know what that Token is, see. And you
       have to make it like that nobody knows it, see, so that all of them will get it. 11 Just like
       preaching salvation, we have to preach salvation in a way that everybody, it’s for everybody,
       which, we know it isn’t. We have to preach Divine healing for everybody, yet we know it isn’t.
       See? Jesus come to save those who was in the Book of Redemption before the foundation of the
       world. He only come to save those. Who they are, I don’t know. See? But you…Nobody can have
       faith unless you say it’s for whosoever; and it is, nobody can come unless God has called
       them. That is true. So there is many people that won’t be saved. We know about it. They, well,

        Let me tell you something, we did devaluated the baptism of the holy ghost. We made it so
       easy that any Tom and Harry, can come right out of the world and come right in and believe
       Brother Branham to be a prophet and you got it! Your sitting out there and you’re not Justified,

        I’ve seen preachers bring people right out of the world, that I know is livin the most dirtiest
       filthiest lives and then tell them, “If they believe the messenger you got it!” May God raise up a
       preacher to tell them they ain’t got it. No sir!
        You’ve got to be obedient to the word of God and receive the word of God by a revelation
       and be Justified and sanctified before you ever get that. (Brother Lambert points to the Faith on

       line, or a Pentecostal message. Right. We are turning a corners. We’re building a building.
       God’s Word is the blueprint. Anybody can run a straight line, but it takes a mason to turn the
       corner. It takes the power of God to do that. It takes an anointed one from Heaven, to be sent
       down to do that. It has, in every age. And in the prophets’ age, the Word of the Lord comes
       through those prophets, and they turn those corners, made those difference. But the builders
       wanted to build a wall. It’s not a wall, at all, it’s a building, a building of God. 113 Now, we feel
       and know that This is the Truth, that the systems was rot in every age. And every one of their
       systems had to rot and die out, until she brought forth that Church. Out of that rotten mess came
       
       99
       forth the Word, Itself. “The Word of the Lord come to the prophets.” Never come to the priests;
       It come to the prophets. 114 And notice, and when It did, finally that Word altogether was
       born here in human flesh. The fullness of the Godhead bodily rested in Him. He was the
       Word. The prophets is part of the Word, the Word for their age. We, today, are part of the
       Word, who follow the Word. But He was the entire fullness of the Word. He was the Word. He
       said… 115 When they was accusing Him, making Himself equal with God, ’cause He was the
       Son of God, they said to Him, “Well, You make Yourself God.” 116 He said, “Isn’t it written
       in your laws, that you call those who the Word of God came to, ‘gods,’ the prophets? And they
       were. Then how can you condemn Me when I say I am the Son of God?” 117 Where, the
       fullness of the Godhead bodily rested in the Son of God. He was the full manifestation of God.
       That’s what finally…The birth pains under those prophets, why, them being the Word, they
       pointed to that fullness of themselves, the fullness of the Word. And then finally the systems
       died away, until, “The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.”
        It’s like the prophet God staggering out of the Tabernacle one day, I was down there when he
       come out after preaching that great message. He fell over on the bosom of one of the deacons
       and I know him. And He fell over and the deacon told later said, “They miss'ter again brother,
       they miss'ter again.” As tears dripped down his face!
        And that’s gonna be the shocker today, when the mix multitude that’s been attracted by the
       supernatural of Malachi 4:5. When the little Bride rises up with the power of God in their lives
       filled with the oil. They’re gonna scream and cry and say, “I was naked and didn’t know it! Give
       me of your oil, I was wrong!” Then their gonna say, “It’s too late!” It Behooves us brothers to
       really look at the thing real good. Because it’s our souls that’s involved.
        Notice here, when we see Malachi 4:5 come, and he was Gods Seth sign of the resurrection.
       We didn’t know what the resurrection was! We didn’t know what the sign of the Messiah was
       the resurrection! No wonder he kept saying, “A greater than Solomon was here.” We didn’t
       know what he was talking about. A greater than Solomon is none other than, the true Baptism of

       something, then, that they cannot destroy. It’s the supernatural Spirit; It’s the Holy Ghost
       Itself, and It’s infallible and It’s imperishable. It cannot be destroyed. It’ll live on, and on, and
       on. And because He lives, we live with Him because we’re sealed into the Body of the Lord
       Jesus Christ. No way, no way to ever be destroyed, cannot perish, but has Eternal Life. Amen.
       God’s great ripping of them seals. 104 He also broke another seal I want to speak of here,
       found over in Exodus. But I won’t have time to get to the Scriptures, but He…Found it over in
       Exodus. When man had sinned and separated himself from the Presence of God, and he came to
       worship God, there was a veil that hung between the holy and the Holiest of holies. Inside the
       Holiest of holies was the Shekinah Glory. They were not permitted to go in There. They were not
       permitted even a look of It. And a man going in there, had to be anointed once a year, dressed
       right, blood on him, blood in his hand, blood in a charger, to sprinkle the Mercy Seat. The
       Shekinah Glory was so great until he lost his rod in there one year, come out without (find;
       leave) bringing his rod. And when he went back, the thing had already come to life, and was
       budded, and blossoms was all over it, because it was laying in the Presence of the Shekinah
       Glory. But there was a veil that hung between There, because there was sin upon the people. 105
       But, oh, brother, when it was sprinkled that day with the Blood of Jesus Christ, a Spirit of God
       rent the seal from the top to the bottom, and brought man back. Not only kept him away from
       the Presence of God, but He brought him back into the Shekinah Glory, into the Presence of
       God; that he, his dead life… 106 Jesus said, “If they did this in a green Tree, what will they do
       in a dry?” And if they did that to Him, being the green Tree with Life, what will it be to the old
       dead formal tree that has no Life, see, now when the wrath of God is poured out? How can an
       old dead formal tree stand it, when the green Tree, it even perished the green Tree, and sent It’s,
       to hell? The wrath of God poured out for disobedience, of sin, sent the green Tree to hell, what
       will it do in a dry tree when it strikes it? “If the righteous will be scarcely saved, where will the
       sinner and ungodly appear?” That person that rejects the Way, that person that knows better,
       that person that’s been revealed to him, and he still refuses to walk in God’s Way, what will
       happen to that person? What’s it going to be? Yes, He broke the seal that kept us from the
       
       101
       Shekinah Glory, because sin was finished now. 107 And now the seal is a sign of a finished
       work. And we know that a seal, like you’re going to seal a boxcar, well, they put all the work
       in it, and store everything up, and then it’s sealed till its destination. Any seal is a finished
       work. When you write a document, then it’s sealed at the end. Never sealed until it’s finished.
       108 Now, the blood of goats and heifers, and so forth, would not take away sin. But when this
       was finished at Calvary, it took away sin. Now watch. 109 At the garden of Eden, to keep people
       from getting back to that Tree, God set an Angel there as a seal, with a sword turning all ways,
       to guard that Tree. And when he made his worship, and he came down…Now remember, Who
       was at that Tree? Who was that Tree? It was Jesus. 110 The tree of death was your mother, she
       brought you here in natural life. Christ is the Birth through Spiritual Life. All that live by the
       woman, die; all that’s born of the Man, lives. All that comes by the woman, is natural; all comes
       from the Man, is Spiritual. Not the man here; the Man Christ Jesus! 111 And watch the Tree,
       guarded; it cannot get back, because there’s no offering appropriated to take sin away. So
       therefore when they come to worship, the Shekinah Glory was behind the veil, sealed off from
       them. It was sealed off from them, from the garden of Eden. 112 But when the Day of Pentecost
       came, brother, when Jesus died there at Calvary and finished the work, He didn’t seal man
       out, He sealed man inside with Himself. And now we’re sealed up, and shut up in the
       Presence of the Shekinah Glory. Not only are we sealed in, but we’re sealed in Eternally.
       Amen! Oh, I love that, sealed inside now! That’s the real Easter Seal, “For by one Spirit we
       are all sealed into one Body.” You say, “Is the Holy Ghost a Seal?” 113 Ephesians 4:30 said,
       “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you’re sealed until the day of your redemption.”
       That’s the genuine, true Easter Seal. Shows that sin has been paid for, for you, and God has
       accepted you, and you’re sealed into Christ by the Holy Ghost. Sin is finished. The Eternal
       Seal has been finished. 114 Now we are resurrected today. Why can we have such a time over
       the things of God? Because we are resurrected. “Those who He foreknew, He called; those
       who He called, He justified; those who He justified, He has glorified.” Then we are now
       resurrected. We are resurrected from the inside out, not from the outside in. Oh! Do you
       notice? Not sealed out, this way, but sealed in. Oh, my, if the church could just see it! See, we’re
       not sealed out, we’re sealed in. Them days, when sin was—was abomination before God, and
       there was no appropriation to take it away, we were sealed away from it. Now when that ripped
       in two, and that seal was broke by a sin-offering being made from us, now we’re baptized
       inside, and sealed inside. We are resurrected. We are now resurrected, already resurrected.
       How do you know? The Bible said so! Amen. We are now resurrected. We are now raised with
       Him in spiritual resurrection. What does the word quickened mean? Quickened means
       “resurrection.” That’s right. We’re already resurrected, right now, sitting together in
       Heavenly places in Christ Jesus, enjoying the Easter Seal. Amen. That’s God’s true Easter
       Seal. How are we? By one Spirit baptized into the Body, and Sealed Eternally. We are now
       raised, spiritually. What did we raise from? From a life of sin, we were once sinners and loved
       the things of the world.
       And we come through the seven-church age, and God said he appointed a seed Seth! And Seth
       was givin in the place of Abel which was the resurrection sign. How many believe that? (Amen)
        All right now watch this. And Seth! THE RESURRECTION SIGN, GAVE BIRTH TO
       ENOCH. Hallelujah! And the Bible said, “After Enoch, then men begin to call upon the name of
       the Lord!” Dare’est say it wasn’t so!
       
       102
        Enoch was a Type of the elected Bride ministry today. That comes forth to read the sign.
       They come forth and read the sign and begin to bring that forth to the people. And then the
       people believe that!
        Now notice here, what’s happen? Brother Branham said, “It may be my going away, if I go
       away I will not be back. I will not be back.” He said, “If I go away I’ll not be back. They’ll be
       another one come on the scene. And I believe that another on is Christ Jesus Our Lord.

       God sent His prophet. SOON AS THE PROPHET GOT THROUGH WITH HIS MESSAGE,
       THE LORD FOLLOWED THE PROPHET’S MESSAGE, FOR DELIVERANCE! 54 Oh, we
       are living in a grand time! Immediately when the prophet went off the scene, what happened?

       down in here…just barely justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Spirit, and now right

       until Christ and the Church can unite together, the same Spirit. And if the Spirit of Christ is in
       you, It makes you live the life of Christ, act the life of Christ, do the works of Christ. “He that
       believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also.” Jesus said that. See? Now we’re going
       to have, we got a ministry coming that’s just exactly like the life of Christ. What does that
       ministry identify? The Coming of the Lord.

        I believe that is the Bridegroom the Holy Ghost, coming to get in the Bride. First, he was in
       one man Malachi 4:5, a type of Seth the resurrection. Then he comes to get into a many
       membered Bride.
        Let me tell you something brother, whoever the preacher is, neighbor friend or foe whoever it
       is, any man that don’t believe that Jesus Christ came for the purpose in this hour to be manifested
       in a many membered body, the flesh your flesh he is an antichrist! Of course, if it’s me or
       whoever it is. That is the predestinated plan of God. CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF
       GLORY! That’s what God wants to do, is get into every child of God. Like he got in the
       apostolic church, on the day of Pentecost and like he was in Malachi 4:5. What he done for them,
       he wants to do for you this morning and myself. Do you believe that? (Amen)
        Notice here after Abel came Seth, and Seth was a sign of the resurrection, an appointed seed.
       Now God has promised us through Malachi 4:5- Seth a promised seed. And when the promised
       seed Malachi 4:5 come then Enoch comes forth. Right!
        Now let’s type Enoch with the ministry of the Bride. Is, that right? (Amen)

       144 But Enoch, the translated one, was a type of the Bride that went up, not the one that was

       Millennium. See? During the Millennium is peace. See? But sin will be dealt with the other side
       of the Millennium, and then time fades out.
        Now notice here, that the ministry of the Bride, is to dress the Bride in the wedding garment.
       On Brother Branham’s tapes, you’ll catch where he said, “That if God called me to come forth in

       60 Now, after we get through with the Seven Seals, then, at that time of the sounding of the
       Seventh Seal, or the loosening… Course, we know what a seal is, IS TO LOOSE THE
       MINISTRY, to loose Seven Seals. And we'll see that right on the chart. Is loosing a Message,
       something that's sealed up.
        Now notice here, then that next ministry that comes forth after Malachi 4:5, the Bride
       ministry. Let’s type that with Enoch. And then the Bible said, then Enoch… Seth gave birth to
       Enoch and then after Enoch, THEN MEN BEGIN TO CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE
       LORD!
        Then Notice here, now with this ministry of the Bride coming forth today, it’s got to produce
       a people that will call upon the Lord!
        Now the Bible said, “Who-so-ever shall call upon the Lord shall be saved.” How can they
       hear without a preacher? How will they preach that, except they be sent? And when they go forth
       with the good news, then who-so-ever receives the good news, who-so-ever receives the good
       news they begin to call out for the thing that God said that he would do.
        Now clear across the country, what are people looking for? What are they calling for? What
       are they calling upon the Lord for? Are you just sitting waitin for the resurrection to set in? Or
       have you read the true sign and your calling upon the Lord?
        Now Brother Branham said, “Go in among the people and hear what their cryin for, hear what
       their praying for and that’s what they’ll receive. “Who-so-ever shall call upon the Lord shall be
       saved.” And brother who-ever don’t call upon the Lord, for what he’s ready to give out in this
       hour will be lost!
        Let’s bow our heads.
       Dear gracious heavenly father, we thank you for the appointed seed today. We thank you for the
       great messenger prophet. Oh, dear father God help us to strive and to struggle to receive Lord,
       and to press into this great kingdom of God, this great Capstone, this great Token seal of God.
       Heavenly father this is the Tremendous Victory today is the Love Divine. And we know that the
       great Love divine is none other than the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Dear father God we want
       this great gift today Lord. Lord we have a little strength, we’ve not denied thy name. And we
       pray God, that you’d give us more grace and more strength. And help us to remain, faithful to
       thy word Lord. Help us to cry with tears in the night Lord. Help us to sweat and pray and strive
       and struggle to come into this great Token. God help us not to take the easy routes Lord, but help
       us Lord to work out our salvation with fear and trembling Lord. Help us to call upon the name of
       the Lord today, to receive what you’ve paid the price for God. Oh God, if we don’t receive it’ll
       be death Lord. But if we receive it’ll be life. Now Lord how we pray that you’ll bless everyone
       here this morning Lord. That set here and endured the long service this morning God. We pray
       that you’ll bless them, strengthen them and encourage them Lord. And oh, father God, we pray
       that you’ll bless your children across the earth Lord. Bless all of the people that’s called by your
       name today, who’s names are on the book. Lord how we pray for the unity of the Bride of Christ.
       Lord let is come to pass, that it’ll be so Lord that we’ll have one revelation. One faith, one Lord
       and one Baptism to be Baptized with Lord. Father God let thy great truth ring out through the
       
       106
       earth today. Make thy message live within our hearts Lord. Circumcise every bit of carnality
       away from us Lord. Help us to be spiritually minded Lord! Help us not to follow after the things
       of the flesh. But help us oh God, to lay aside all these things and press toward the kingdom. God
       help us to remain faithful to thy word, that we may see the resurrection of the dead come forth.
       So, we know God that without the perfection of the Bride, without the seal of God they cannot
       come forth Lord. For we that which are alive and remain Lord have a duty and a responsibility to
       the word and to prayer. And receive the revelation of God for the hour, to come into the great
       Token Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Bless our hearts this morning father God, and may that day
       soon arrive when you’ll pour out your spirit Lord and seal up your little Bride and the marriage
       supper of the Lamb may come. For we ask it in Jesus name, amen.

       322 Brother, let’s get all things ready, for one of these days the Fire is going to fall. We’re going
       up. Now let’s get ready for the Fire-falling time. We’re in the last days, we all know that, and
       we’re ready for the Coming of the Lord. The thing to do is separate yourself from all sin.
       Separate yourself from anything that pertains to the world. “Don’t love the world or the things
       of the world.” 323 “Let no man, by his creed, deceive you.” You stay right straight in the
       promise of God, the Word of God. And that Word, if It’s a Word for this day, God vindicates It
       so. If He doesn’t, it’s not the Word for this day. 324 The Word that fell on the Day of
       Pentecost will not work this day. No, sir. That was for Pentecost. This is for the Bride, going
       Home of the Bride. We got something different. The Pentecostals represented that, again.
       We’re in the Bride age. No more than the—the Word of Noah would work in the days of Moses;
       no more than Moses’ law would have worked in the time of Paul here. He tried to tell them,
       “You are dead to that, and you cannot have that.” 325 Church, you who I’m speaking to,
       tonight, across the nation, if—if you’ve separated yourself from denomination and all the filth
       and things of this world, and all those things that keeps you in man-made creeds and orders and
       things like that, you separated yourself: Look up. Get ready. The Fire is going to fall, one of
       these days. God is going to let Him come, and a sight to behold. Would you be ready when He
       comes? Would you be ready to go up with Him when He comes? The secret Rapture of the
       supernatural Bride, “She’ll be made mor-…from mortal to immortality; be changed, in a
       moment, in a twinkling of eye. We which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which
       are asleep.”
        Brother I ain’t looking for atomic power, I’m looking for apostolic power. The fire of God,
       the kind that came on the day of Pentecost and handed out each one’s inheritance. And they
       received what the preacher Peter told them about. How many want to receive what God is tryin
       to give to his people today? Remember that’s your salvation. What faith is the substance! (We’re
       Hoping for) And what are we hoping for today? The capstone, perfect love. And faith is the
       substance, to receive that (Brother Lambert pointing to the Capstone on top of the pyramid.) and
       to cry out to God for that and call upon the Lord. The only ones that’s callin for that, is goin in
       the rapture. How in the world can you…Look out now and see what people are calling for and
       where they’re goin. People that are at ease sitting in Zion saying, “We already got it! Just sitting
       around it’s all over! Malachi 4:5 is he last manifestation!” I want to tell you that, that’s the
       biggest antichrist spirit that I know of in the land today. That will kill your soul! That’ll leave
       you here during in the tribulation!
        It’s only to those that are looking for him the second time, shall he come to them. Those that
       are looking for him. Watching and praying and looking for that day! And are calling upon the
       thing that he promised to do! God will do nothing, till first he sends his prophet! And then when
       the prophet comes, then there is something that Gods wanting to do, is on its way! God, send it
       this morning upon us!

        Congregation sings: “Only Believe”
        Notice friend, that after they called upon the Lord, what happen? The flood destroyed them
       all. And the Bible said, “In that last day, that notable day of the Lord, when the sun won’t shine.
       There will be blood in the earth and fire and a vapor of smoke. It said, “In that day that who-so –
       ever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved!” And then what happens? As the water
       destroyed them all in that day, God has opened up the seals and gave a revelation to the Bride
       and she can call upon the Lord! He can’t come, till the Bride is crying and praying and sweatin
       and strivin. You’re not gonna take this mountain easy!
        People think because they come into the message and listen to the tapes and believe the
       prophet and that they’re all sealed away! That’s the biggest lie they devil ever told! God will
       expose that lie for what it is today. That’ll send more people through the tribulation then I know
       of.
        But the true little Bride is gonna get a revelation of the promise of the hour! And the promise
       of the hour, is not just the gifts of the spirit. It’s not just speaking in tongues! It’s not just
       justification! But it’s Christ himself, the Bridegroom, he’s gonna give you himself!
        In that day, when Seth-Malachi 4:5 the resurrection sign comes. In that day when you see me
       in one man! Don’t tell me he wasn’t! I never seen no man in the world that…And I traveled all
       over United States for thirteen years and slept on the ground and everything. Why? Because I
       seen a man that could prove and demonstrate the Baptism of the Holy Ghost! And after that, in
       that day, you’ll know I’m in him! But, “In that day you’ll know, that I’m in the father and the
       father in me and I in you and you in me.” Why it so shocked people to see Christ in an
       individual, that they thought it was God himself. And they begin to worship him and Baptize in
       his name.

       that will forerun the Second Coming of Christ. That’s what the Angel of the Lord said. 385
       Now, now notice. Now, “As John the Baptist…” Now, all of you have heard that. You’ve read it
       in books, and heard people that standing there hearing It, and everything else, when that Angel
       Itself spoke that message, “As John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 9 - The Laodicean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       Though he will not be popular, he will be vindicated by God. As Jesus authenticated John, and
       the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus, we can well expect this man will be first of all authenticated
       by the Spirit working in his life in acts of power that are indisputable and found nowhere else;
       and Jesus Himself, in returning, will authenticate him, even as He authenticated John. John
       witnessed that Jesus was coming, — and so will this man, like John, witness that Jesus is coming.
       And the very return of Christ will prove that this man indeed was the forerunner of His second
       coming. This is the final evidence that this indeed is the prophet of Malachi 4, for the end of the
       Gentile period will be Jesus, Himself, appearing. Then it will be too late for those who have
       rejected him. In order to further clarify our presentation of this last-day prophet, let us
       particularly note that the prophet of Matthew 11:12, was John the Baptist, who was the one
       foretold in Malachi 3:1, “Behold, I will send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way
       before Me; and the Lord, Whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, even the
       Messenger of the Covenant, Whom ye delight in: behold, He shall come, saith the Lord of
       Hosts.” Matthew 11:1-12, “And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding
       His twelve disciples, He departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. Now when John
       had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and said unto Him, Art
       thou He That should come, or do we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto them, Go
       and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: the blind receive their sight, and the
       lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have
       the Gospel preached to them. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in Me. And as
       they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the
       wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed
       in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses. But what went ye out
       for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. For this is he, of whom it
       
       110
       is written, Behold, I send My messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before
       Thee. Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a
       greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is
       greater than he.” This has already taken place. This has happened. It is over. But note now in
       Malachi 4:1-6, “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea,
       and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
       Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear My Name
       shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow
       up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the
       soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts. Remember ye the law of
       Moses My servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with statutes and
       judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and
       dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the
       heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.” See,
       immediately after the coming of THIS Elijah, the earth will be cleansed by fire and the wicked
       burned to ashes. Of course, this did NOT happen at the time of John (the Elijah for his day). The
       Spirit of God that prophesied the coming of the messenger in Malachi 3:1 (John) was but
       reiterating His previous prophetic statement of Isaiah 40:3 made at least three centuries
       previously. “The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
       make straight in the desert a highway for our God.” Now John, by the Holy Ghost, voiced both
       Isaiah and Malachi in Matthew 3:3, “For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
       saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His
       paths straight.” So we can well see from these Scriptures that the prophet in Malachi 3, who was
       John, was NOT the prophet of Malachi 4, though indeed, both John and this last-day prophet
       have upon them the same Spirit Which was upon Elijah. Now this messenger of Malachi 4 and
       Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things. One: According to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts
       of the children to the fathers. Two: He will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in
       Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals. It will be these Divinely
       revealed “mystery-truths” that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers.
       Exactly so. But consider this also. This prophet-messenger will be in his nature and manners
       as were Elijah and John. The people of this prophet-messenger’s day will be as they were in
       Ahab’s day, and in John’s. And since it is “ONLY THE CHILDREN” whose hearts will be
       turned, it is only the children who will listen. In the days of Ahab only 7,000 true-seed Israelites
       were found. In the days of John there were also very few. The masses in both ages were in the
       fornication of idolatry. I want to make one more comparison between the Laodicean prophetmessenger and John, the prophet-messenger who preceded Jesus’ first coming. The people in
       John’s day mistook him for the Messiah. John 1:19-20, “And this is the record of John, when
       the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? And he confessed,
       and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.” Now this last-day prophet-messenger will
       have such power before the Lord that there will be those who mistake him for the Lord Jesus.
       (There will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe
       this. Matthew 24:24-26, “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew
       great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
       Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, He is in the desert;
       go not forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe it not.”) But don’t you believe it. He
       is not Jesus Christ. He is not the Son of God. HE IS ONE OF THE BRETHREN, A
       
       111
       PROPHET, A MESSENGER, A SERVANT OF GOD. He needs no greater honor bestowed
       upon him than that which John received when he was the voice that cried, “I am not He, BUT
       HE IS COMING AFTER ME.”

       53 Now I want you to notice another thing that might encourage you. Immediately after that
       prophet’s Message, the Lord appeared on the scene. Amen! As soon as he gave his Message,
       the Lord appeared under a tree. The Lord came, after the Message of the prophet, sitting under
       a tree. The prophet gave…The people fell away, got off in their isms. God sent His prophet. Soon
       as the prophet got through with his Message, the Lord followed the prophet’s Message, for
       deliverance! 54 Oh, we are living in a grand time! Immediately when the prophet went off the
       scene, what happened? The Lord came on the scene! As soon as John went off the scene, the

       30 What we need is a revival. We put corn plasters on, take them off; another corn plaster, take
       it off, and still find the pain is there. What we need today is not social regeneration, it’s not
       intellectual talks. What we need today is an old-fashion, God-sent Blood transfusion from
       Heaven. The corn plasters won’t do no good. We are anemia. We need a Blood transfusion. We
       need to come back to the old-fashion Gospel that calls out for repentance before God. And not
       a dry-eyed, hand-shook profession; but a God-sent, Holy Ghost revival with the possession of
       the cleansing of the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ into every human heart. We need a revival
       to start in the Church, and sweep the nation across. We’ll die, we’ll perish, we are gone,
       without that type of revival. 31 I’m so sick and tired of seeing little petty Hollywood revivals, socalled, where people come in and get emotionally stirred up for a couple hours, and, or a day or
       two, or a week or two, and go out and that’s all of it. Brother, you can be in a…worked up by a
       revival. You can have emotion. You can have good intentions. All those things are fine, but we
       don’t need that today. 32 We need a baptism of the Holy Spirit, to change the emotion, and the
       intellect, and the view, the habits, the life of the people, and put them back on the right road
       
       112
       again. Outside of a Blood transfusion from Calvary, all of our reformations won’t do any good
       at all.
        I believe like Brother Ruddell said, “Why, if this is the manifested Bride, if this is all he can
       do, why he’ll have to come in and get her at night and put a sack over her head she’s so ugly!”
        But brother, he’s coming after a Bride, she’s gonna be woman from the head to her toes to the
       top of her head. She’s gonna be, Word Born Flesh, power of God made manifested! She’s gonna
       manifest every promise of God for the hour! And then and only then will he come after her!

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       Here is what I am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth
       after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let the earth bring forth
       grass, and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
       itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and
       thence into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the
       church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. In these last
       days the true Bride Church (Christ’s seed) will come to the Headstone, and she will be the
       super church, a super race, as she nears Him. They in the bride will be so much like Him that
       they will even be in His very image. This is in order to be united with Him. THEY WILL BE
       ONE. THEY WILL BE THE VERY MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF THE LIVING
       GOD. Denominations cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and
       their dogmas, mixed with the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product.

       95 It’s all drawed down, if we had time. I know it’s getting late, and it’s getting late. 96 But
       look, friends, the hour has come, and is now, that when God’s great drama is set here before
       us. The Son of God, that was in the cradle, is in the heart now. He is the Deity of God. He is
       God, the Creator. He said, “All things…He was in the world, and the world was made by Him,
       and the world knew Him not.” 97 And, today, that’s what’s the matter with the church. The hope
       of Glory, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, has come into the people’s hearts, and they don’t
       recognize what It is. They think it’s a little church-joining, or something like that. 98 But that is
       the God, the Creator, living in you, and giving you all the Powers. And you’re in possession of
       anything that He had. So is It in you to abstain from evil, to do good, to shun evil and flee to
       righteousness, to turn away from temptation. All malice, hatred, strife, envy, and so forth, turn
       away from it, for that’ll take Him from your heart. If you will receive Him, embrace Him and
       love Him, and hold Him in your heart and love Him! I CAN TELL YOU, THE CHURCH
       TOGETHER IN THAT KIND OF A POWER, HAS THE POWER TO BIND THE
       HEAVENS, HEAL THE SICK, OPEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND, HALLELUJAH, THE

       application to it, you know.
        Well he went down… They was poor people over in Ireland like. And he found a little round
       ball like something, a little marble. And he picked it up and it was a strange looking marble. And
       all at once he was wanting a little doll for his little girlfriend. He was wanting a little doll for her
       and they could never hope to get it because they was so poor. And he said, “I wish I had that
       little tractor there.” But they could never hope to ever get it. And he loved that little girl, she was
       a school girlfriend. And all at once he rubbed that marble and it started glistening. Then he didn’t
       realize what he had done and he said, “I wish I had that little doll for that little girl” And then all
       at once it just, appeared. And it shocked him. Then he found out when he rubbed that little
       marble, he could ask anything and get it.
        I said, “OH GOD! YOU SAID WHAT SO EVER WE’D ASK IN JESUS NAME YOU
       WOULD GIVE IT TO US!” And we devaluate God! We get one little prayer answered, why
       then what? But he said, “Ask anything in my name, I’ll give you!”

       20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
       according to the power that worketh in us,
        We think Malachi 4:5 exhausted, Gods corn crib. I tell you, he never done it! He wants us to
       ask in his name and get it.
        There’ll arise a Bride on the scene, as sure as I stand here. And may we contend to be that
       Bride this morning.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 3 - The Ephesian Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.” How tragic it is that
       this first age did not listen to the Spirit. Instead it listened to man. But thank God, in the last age
       there will be a group rise up, the True Bride of the last day, and she will listen to the Spirit. In
       that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure Word and we will return to the
       power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ.
        Now let’s close our eyes and sing this one more time, with all of your heart. Do you want to
       be that little Bride? (Amen) To manifest what God called you to. God help us now!
        Congregation sings: “Only Believe”
        Now let’s bow our heads, may God bless you as you go!

        Would you like to rededicate your lives to the Lord Jesus this morning? How many with an
       uplifted hand, would like to rededicate your life. Amen!
       Let us all pray together.
        Let’s all pray out loud to the Lord Jesus in your heart. Tell him, what your gonna do now.
       That your gonna…You know somebody’s here. You know he’s here. That’s for a reason. That’s
       for a reason, see. He’s here for a reason. He wants you to rededicate your lives this morning.
        How many here, every one of you know your convicted the way you’ve been livin? You’ve
       been letting down. Let’s see your hands. Let’s see your hands. Now Gods called you to press for
       revival, and you’re not pressin. That’s why he’s here this morning, to remind you of why you’re
       here in Connecticut. There’s a reason why you’re here. I’m afraid that this assembly, is
       beginning to lose its vision and get into churchianity and a form of religion. And I want to tell
       you that this morning. I believe the Lord, laid it upon my heart to tell you. Now how many want
       to renounce this thing this morning and get rid of it and get a vision? Let’s see both of your
       hands, up in the air. How many of you are not gonna forget this morning what happen here this
       morning? Let’s all pray together.
       Brother Lambert prays opening prayer:
        Gracious almighty God, we come to thee this morning, asking for forgiveness of our sins.
       Forgive us of our sins Lord and cleanse us from all of our unrighteousness Lord. God, we
       rededicate and reconsecrate our lives to thee anew! Oh God, renew our vision Lord. Stimulate
       our faith Lord. And help us to be strong and courageous Lord and press and strive and struggle
       into the Kingdom of God. Oh God! Help us not to lose our vision Lord and why you’ve called us
       by thy name Lord. May God, we rededicate and reconsecrate our lives to thee Lord. In Your
       holiness and your righteousness in the word of God and in prayer Lord. Forsaking all things and
       cleaving unto the Lord Jesus Christ. Help us oh God, in Jesus name help us this morning Lord.
       Amen!
        You may be seated. Now, I’d like to this week, to have a special week of dedicating and
       consecrating our lives to the word of God and prayer. Then if you’re working and you can and
       you have strength to do it, I wonder if some of you men and women wouldn’t fast this week.
       Have a week of repenting and searching our hearts with the Lord Jesus.
        Then Saturday night we’ll have a special service. A special service Saturday night and
       Sunday morning and Sunday night. Maybe Brother Don (Ruddell) and Brother Mike (Canada), I
       kinda feel I’ll call them and have them come up. And let us press the battle and pray that...
        I’m afraid that… by according to what I feel the Holy Spirit this morning. And yesterday, I
       did something felt lead to do something and go talk to a few of the little brethren. We had some
       things goin on in the congregation, it just wasn’t pleasing to the Lord at all. I went over and
       talked to them and got it all straightened out now. And I see one of the other little brothers, isn’t
       here this morning.
       
       2
        But we pray that God would help this congregation to realize, why you are here in
       Connecticut. I’m afraid…And its been… it’s caused me to kinda draw back from the Lord. And I
       want to ask God to forgive me this morning, myself. I’m gonna strive harder this week, I’m
       gonna consecrate myself to God this week. I’m just getting a little weary and in a little rut
       pastoring. I just got to feeling the revelation is so common and we’re just getting kinda formal
       and just comin to church and lookin to brother Bob and it’s killin me! Your lookin to Brother
       Bob, see. And really, I ain’t able to bare up under it. I’m just a little human being and needy in
       my own soul of God, I need more of the Holy Ghost and the power of God in my life. And its
       caused me to even desire to just…I’m goin through terrible trials, straits I’ve never had been in
       such a place as I have this last month. Because I’ve been pastoring here for so long. Usually a
       pastor doesn’t last over two years. If God hasn’t called him to that place, he’s got to move on.
       And because it gets common to the people, and the people take what he’s sayin and it gets
       common.
        That has nothing to do with us. Because we’re not an ordinary run of the line of an assembly.
       God has called you people here, from different places all over the United States, to press God for
       a revival. And you cannot get, we cannot get a revival just lapsing around. Just coming to service
       Wednesday night, comin to service Sunday morning and Sunday night and well, “Wonder what
       Brother Bob is gonna say?” See, you every one of you have got a moral spiritual moral
       responsibility to God, to seek the Lord God with all your heart to find out, what is the
       predestinated mystery of his will for YOU!
        This is not a…See, we’re kinda getting in this thing… it’s always a big trick of the enemy.
       He’s really tricked…he’s really working on this congregation. A lot of times I know it, but I
       don’t know what to do about it and I just keep going on letting it go on. But yesterday, I went
       over and talked to a couple of the brethren, that the ole enemy is tryin to put a spirit of clicks.
       Starting little clicks in the church and around the revelation of God, that’s comin in this hour, on
       the coming of the Bridegroom.
        And remember the Bridegroom’s one thing, and the man is something else altogether. And I
       hope to God that this congregation, doesn’t go coo ‘coo over God’s revelation.
        And that’s happened it’s happened before, in the ministry of Gods messenger and prophet.
       When the revelation come, forth they knew that it was God’s revelation and it just turned the
       ministry upside down. And they didn’t know which way to go and the people also. And they had
       to forsake all that what they thought they knew and realize that they didn’t know nothing. And
       then they got little special revelations goin, and little clicks goin. And we got the revelation and
       the rest of the people ain’t got it.
        And then we had a spirit tryin to move in this congregation a couple of months ago, trying to
       figure out who Judas was. And by the help of God, I felt lead one Sunday morning to minister
       against that and got that spirit out. And then it creeped right in again with some of the little
       brethren, especially. And beginning to get off the beaten track, they’re not able to rightly…
        Well, it’s one thing, when the man Gods called to preach the revelation. He’s the one that’s
       called to do it, and you’re just called to believe it, and that’s all! And you believe that in your
       heart. And you’re not to try to transplant that revelation from your mouth into somebody else’s
       heart. Because if you keep doin that, it’ll keep goin on until it will get clear out and it won’t be
       no more pure revelation. All you do is, you believe it! And God only God almighty knows
       whether or not you’re believing it by a revelation. And you’re not to try to transplant that into
       somebody else’s heart.
       
       3
        Now if you want to talk and that’s what has grieved…And I went yesterday over and told the
       brethren and said, “The quality of the meeting’s is fall'in way off. And I know the cause of it.
       And God does not want you to get your eyes upon any man. Now believe me with all my heart,
       it’s Jesus Christ in this hour and him alone! Of course, he’s gonna use his servants, but that has
       nothing to do… you keep your eyes upon the Lord Jesus. And realizing if it was not for the
       Grace of God and the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, God would snuff his servant’s life right out
       like that, see.
        And I’m afraid, that’s what happen in the ministry of Brother Branham. People got to
       worshipping Brother Branham and got to looking to Brother Branham. And when the people of
       God get to looking to man and get their eyes off of the Lord Jesus Christ, your gonna find that
       your gonna wind up in trouble. It’s the Lord Jesus! It’s the Lord Jesus we Love!
        And the only way that we can love one another is because we’re all after that Love of the
       Lord Jesus. And that’s the only thing that matters, not one another.
        And it got to goin in the congregation and some of the brothers right here, a couple of them
       I’ve talked to and time and time again this has got warped out. Even when the brothers started
       here and seen the great revelation of God comin and then they begin to talk around. I don’t like
       to say this! I don’t even like for it to come out of my mouth. They Say, “Well I believe Brother
       Lambert’s a prophet” Now you know what that does, to me I never want to hear that! Because
       that causes me to…It just scares me so bad, I don’t like to hear it! And I don’t want it to be heard
       and named in this congregation at all. Not even that! And then they got even…And I went to
       them and said, “Now brethren I tell you what! Do you love me?” They said, “Yes!” I said, “All
       right, I’d rather you take me out back of the church and give me a good beaten! Black both of my
       eyes and stomp me in the ground! But don’t say that, no more! Don’t say that, no more!
       Just let me be your brother! Because we’re livin in an hour when a great prophet of God has
       come on the scene and the people that’s following him, love him! And it’s resentful to them for
       you to say that. They don’t want God to bring any other servant. They don’t want that and I don’t
       blame them, see. I tell you the truth, I would that the messenger of God come back up out of the
       grave and continue on and let me sit down and say amen to what he’s sayin. But I can’t tell God
       what to do, that’s up to him!”
        But we’ve got something here… we’ve got to be as wise a serpent and harmless as little doves
       here. We can’t just slop around and let our mouth just say anything it wants to. And the brethren
       has been just grieving the Lord. And what its doin is hurtin the preacher, its hurtin the
       congregation. And that’s why he’s here this morning, because I let the brethren see that and I
       told them. Is that right, brethren? Give me an amen, that I talked to you yesterday? (Brothers say,
       amen) See! And why is it, why is he here this morning? Is Because he’s pleased. See! He’s
       pleased! It ought to be like this all the time. And I know when the quality of the holy spirit been
       dropping off. And it’s dropping off around my own life. I wanna tell you, you people here you’ll
       either keep Jesus Christ around me or your gonna take him away from me! That’s what your
       gonna do. And how many here want to take the Lord Jesus away from me? How many want the
       Lord Jesus to stay with me? Well, the only way that he’ll ever stay with me and deal with me, is
       that you cry out to God for the Lord Jesus. And when you begin to look to Brother Bob then…
       I’m in the worse strait right now in my ministry, that I’ve been to when I ought to be right up in
       just the high lite, right before God gets ready to do something. I’ve ought to be in great…I have
       never seen such pressure on me. Till honestly, I’ve sinned against God with my mouth, I go to
       bed at night and I say, “Let me die, let me die!” That’s right, I’m ashamed of it. And I say, “Lord
       God help me not to act that way and do that anymore.” And turn around the next week and I
       
       4
       dread to come to service, it’s like pullin my teeth. And that ought not to be! That ought not to be!
       I know that I’ve brought so much revelation here and its up around the Capstone. And I can’t go
       any higher than that capstone.
        But you see, you can’t fall down. And we don’t have know normal type of assembly that,
       Brother Bob comes and preaches and you go back home. My, the Lord God, hasn’t called you
       for that. He’s called you to receive a revival. And you have heard enough preaching to convert
       the whole world and turn it upside down and round and round. You don’t need no more
       preaching, honestly you don’t! There’s not one major message that you need to hear! You have
       heard everything that you need to hear. The trouble is, you don’t want to act upon it. See, you
       want one man to do it all and it’s not gonna be done that way, see!
        Just like Brother William always said, “I want to go out and sleep till the Holy Ghost comes.”
       He’ll never get the Holy Ghost, goin out sleeping out in his car. And I told him time and time
       again, “You’ve got strive and struggle and work yourself into this thing or you ain’t gonna get it.
       You can holler the Grace of God and predestination all you want to and you’ll miss it”
        Every person of God has a moral responsibility to God, that they must pray! They must cry!
       They must strive! They must struggle! With sweat and tears, for the Lord Jesus Christ to come
       and do this thing!
        Of course, God will use man to bring his revelation. But once God gives his revelation to his
       man and he puts it in your lap, now it’s on your hands and off of his. And as far as preaching…
       As far as preaching... I have stayed in that room for ten and twelve and thirteen hours a day. And
       it’s got to where it’s just got goin till I…It’s just such a burdensome to me. That I’ve bein tryin
       to just stay out on the water out there, to just get away from everything. But see, I can’t do that
       I’ve got to press and strive and struggle. And I’ve been telling the Lord, “If you’ll send me
       somewhere over sea’s, send me somewhere Lord where they haven’t heard this. I can’t go on
       like this, I’m dyin!” Well, children of God I don’t want to die! I want to be on fire for God. My
       whole life is around this revelation.
        And but, see the way that it’s goin here, its killin me. And if the congregation, unless we
       quickly wake up your gonna die. Your gonna come down till your just gonna be just like…I
       know some of you are sayin, “Well, we’ve got to die” I resent that statement! I don’t like it, it’s
       not found in God’s word and its nowhere in the word of God.
        The Bible said that, “Abraham increased in faith” The Bible said, “Be strong in the Lord in
       the power of his might, in the revelation of God’s word” There is nowhere in this hour is the
       Bride is to be…It said, “To those that are watching and praying and striving and struggling to
       enter in.” That’s the only ones that will get the Token. To those that are watching and praying
       striving and struggling to come into it.

        And now everybody… the Holy Ghost has come here to vindicate to you to prove that… now
       he come. Now it’s my responsibility to tell you why he come, as his minister. I’ll interpret why,
       that spirit was here the way it was this morning. Number one, the congregation needs to repent.
       Number two, every person in this congregation had better wake up! Because you are livin in the
       end-time.

       coming forth something from the Lord! I know it as THUS SAITH THE LORD.

       your conscience, wake yourself up, in this hour! We must be desperate, or perish! There is
       coming forth something from the Lord! I know it as THUS SAITH THE LORD. There is
       coming forth something, and we better get desperate. It's between Life and death. It'll pass
       through us and we won't see it.
        And I’m gonna bring a little message here after I get through talking.
        Every one of you have a moral responsibility to God to seek the Lord Jesus with all your
       heart, to find out why you’re here upon earth. What is his predestined mystery of his will for
       you? Now remember it’s an individual thing, every one of you. Teddy can’t do it for Richard,
       Teddy can’t do it for Bill. Bill can’t do it for Teddy and Vice-versa. Sister Ruth can’t do it for
       Dale and Dale can’t do it for Ruth. When the rapture gets ready to take place, if Dale don’t have
       that Token, he’s stayin' right in his bed. Right in his bed! If Ruth doesn’t have it, if she doesn’t
       get that Token it’s gonna catch her when she least expects it and she’ll reach over the next
       morning for her husband and he’ll be gone. So, don’t get your eyes upon time and time is what’s
       getting us in a rut here, see. How many say, “Amen?” (Amen) Because the Holy Spirit isn’t
       poured out yet, then we get in a rut and go to sleep thinking, “Well, will just numb away our
       time” And the Bible said, “Watch for the son of man cometh in an hour you think not” In an hour
       that you think not! See! In other words, he could catch you just luke-warm and cold and you
       wouldn’t come to church some night, or some morning and the Holy Spirit was poured out and
       you missed it. And then it throwed you into desperations, to seek and strive to enter in. And one
       day they’ll seek and strive to enter in and not be able to.
       Matthew 24:44-Reference quote:
       44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
       Luke 12:40-Reference quote:

        Now, you have of all people have been givin the blessed opportunity, to hear God’s revelation
       first. Either this revelation come from God or it didn’t! And you know that it does because, it’s
       the only revelation that’s in the earth today that fits the message and the word of God. Therefore,
       its God! Gods spirit bears witness to it. And he is holding you responsible, to go after this
       revival. Sure, it’s predestinated, yes sir! I believe that! But brother you are morally obligated, to
       pay the price for that revival. There’s a price to be paid for it, and that’s seek the Lord God with
       all your soul and all your might.
       Deuteronomy 6:5-Reference quote:
       5 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
       thy might.
       Hebrews 11:6-Reference quote:
       6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he
       is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
        Do you think I’d ever…Sure I was called to get this revelation, but let me tell you something!
       I never did get it, until I closed the door and went in the room and stayed with him, ten and
       twelve and fourteen hours a day, year after year I stayed there. It’s only in the last few months
       that I dare to waste any of Gods time at all and I’m even convicted about that. I say, “Now, Lord
       I’ve just preached and I can’t stand it in the room any longer” But I’m gonna have to bear up
       under my responsibility to the word of God. God requires me, even though I look in the bible and
       see that I have preached God’s revelation completely from Geneses to Revelations. There’s only
       a few major messages that I haven’t preached, that I haven’t felt lead to preach.
        And I’ve told you time and time again that everything you need to know is right on those
       tapes down there. That is the message of the hour. That’s Gods vision, its right there on tape and
       everything you need. If this congregation could digest everything that is on those tapes and live
       it, I tell you this would be the place of Gods power. That’s right! But see, we’re a natural human
       being, and we want a preacher, we want something that’s tangible. See, we want something that
       will do it, tell us. But you see, it’s you, it’s you! You’re an individual, you’ve got to do it.
       You’ve got to cry to God. Because if you don’t, then that just cuts off the life line to Gods
       servant.
        And so, God showed us this morning. And then the brethren promised me, that there would be
       no more talk about this Bridegroom. You leave that alone to the Lord Jesus.
        And remember…of course you believe it, because you hear the word and see it go together.
       But remember strangers come in, have not set and heard what you’ve heard and seen it fit
       together. And see it proven by the word of God, month in and month out and year in and year
       out. They have not heard, so therefore, you must be wise as a serpent and not tell them. See! Let
       them see for their self and then they’ll have it. But if you try to transplant it to them, then it’ll be
       by proxy and it won’t be no good. They have got to see it.

        And then what you believe that God has called your pastor for now…For now you know that
       I’m not a pastor. But I am your pastor, like Paul was see. But now, you keep that in your heart,
       see. Then let God prove that from heaven, see. Let God, prove that! And if you try to prove that
       to somebody by mouth, then it’ll be offensive to them.
        And what… we’ll take God’s revelation right here and make a cult out of it. Did you know
       that we could take God’s revelation right here and make a cult out of it? And just get to thinking
       we’re it and boy we got it, we got God’s servant, we got God’s revelation. So, therefore we are
       eternal secure. No sir' re!
        Let me tell you something! Did you know that even after all this, did you know He could
       move right off and leave us here in Connecticut? Snatch me right out of here and take me right
       over sea’s and leave you sittin right here and he’ll be gone. Now, nobody wants that do they? I
       don’t want to go nowhere. I don’t want to go over seas. I don’t want to go nowhere. I want to
       stay here with you. I want to see you…If you do your will…
        And Brother William you be quiet. Your just one of the biggest faults right in this church and I
       rebuke you, right before this congregation this morning! You sit there and be still! See, brother
       William wants to go out and sleep till Jesus comes and then get filled with the Holy Ghost. He’s
       not willing to come in the prayer meetings and pay the price in prayer. He wants you all to do it!
       He wants Teddy to do it, he wants everybody else to do it. And I told William time and time
       again as God’s servant, it’ll not come that way. He’ll come this way here, striving and struggling
       like all of us with Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness brotherly kindness.
        And you’ll not get that easy brother. You’ll get it with sweat and tears and crying’s to God.
       And if any man tells you that you’ll get it any other way…Anything that will tell you can get it
       any other way is a liar and a thief and a robber, see. I’d like to read you some notes that are
       personal from Brother Branham. So, let it be known, don’t you let the devil deceive you, to think
       you can just come here to service Wednesday night, come to service Sunday morning and come
       here to service Sunday night and just let Brother Bob do it! I tell you it’ll not be that way! We’ll
       weep and cry! Sure, it’s predestinated, sure it’s the promise of God. But if we get it, brother we’ll
       have to take it away from the devil. And you can’t take it away from the devil, laying on your
       bed sleeping. I tell you that right now! You yourself, can’t sleep your way through this thing!
       You can’t just set around lazy, luke-warm and lazy and not pray. “I don’t feel like praying” I
       want somebody to give me a scripture.
        William is all the time saying, “I can’t praise God” Why, can’t you praise God? “I can’t pray”
       Why can’t you pray? Why can’t you pray? Why can’t we pray? Why can’t we worship God? “I
       can’t raise my hand and worship God, I don’t feel like it” If everybody in this congregation felt
       like William, I’d die of a heart attack overnight. Now, I wouldn’t of said nothing to William, if
       he hadn’t opened his mouth back there. The Bible said, “For those that sin rebuke openly.” And
       that spirit needs a good solid rebuking in this congregation. And if everybody had the same…
       God knows, William knows that I love him! William knows that I love him! William the next
       time you open your mouth, I have fooled with you and suffered with you. The next time you
       open your mouth, I’m gonna have the deacons put you out of this congregation. Deacons the next
       time that he opens his mouth and speaks up in the congregation against the spirit of God, I want
       that man removed from this congregation. And he’ll not get back in, until he repents of that! I
       have suffered with that for four years. And God knows that I love that man with all my heart. But
       I’m standing here this morning and I mean just what I say, and that man is resenting the spirit of
       God! (Congregation is weeping)
       
       8
       1 Timothy 5:20
       20 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
        Children don’t you know that’s dangerous, to do that? That’s the same thing that caused
       Edman Wade to fall dead right in his tracks. Now he’ll be at my house tomorrow repenting, just
       like he has for four years. But he’ll let that devil do that to him! And what is it doin? Destroying
       William. Now I can’t go on and let William think that he can go on and live like that and be
       saved. He can’t do it!
        See! Children you believe me, that every one of us here from the pastor clear down to every
       member here, has a spiritual moral responsibility, to seek the Lord God in Prayer and in
       consecration in the word of God with all your heart and all your soul and with all your might!
       You cannot enter into this thing with lazy lackadaisical attitude. Now how many know I’m
       telling you the truth, let’s see your hands. We’ve got to do it, see! It’s do that or perish. You’ll
       have to do it or perish.
        Did you know that was the same thing that happen to the Branham Tabernacle? Do you know
       what caused the light to leave the Branham Tabernacle? Is because they had Brother Branham
       with them, see. Cause they had brother Branham with them. They rested in the fact that God’s
       prophet lived right up the street, from where the Tabernacle was at. They rested in the fact, that
       he come there Sunday morning and Sunday night! And he was with them, see. And they rested in
       that! And he kept tryin to get them to cry and struggle for that Baptism of the Holy Ghost, to
       come into that revival. And what happen? What happen?

       65-0220 - God's Chosen Place Of Worship
       William Marrion Branham
       71 My friends, I don’t want to hurt feelings, but I am responsible for a Message, and, that
       Message is, “Come out of this mess!” And if I ask you to come out, where am I going to take
       you to? Would I take you to the Branham Tabernacle? It’s as much fault as any of the rest of
       them. But there’s one place I can take you to, where you’re safe and protected from death,
       that’s in Jesus Christ, God’s place of worship. That’s the place I’m introducing to you, tonight,
       where God put His Name. Where He promised He would meet every person that come in there,
       He would worship with him and feast with him, that’s in Christ; not in no church, no tabernacle.
       But, in Christ, He is God’s Tabernacle. He is the place that God came into, Himself, and dwelt in
       Him. “This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am pleased to dwell in.” There is where God
       tabernacled, brought His Name and placed It upon, Jesus Christ. Therefore, His Name was put
       in a Man, His Son, Jesus Christ, in which He tabernacled Himself, and in that Tabernacle.

       54-0512 - The Seven Church Ages
       William Marrion Branham
       174 Excuse us, strangers, I’m giving the church a little Gospel spanking now. Notice, that’s
       right. It’s exactly what you need. 175 “Oh,” you say, “we got It.” And get up there and beat the
       piano as hard as it can go, and a bunch of drums, and run up and down the floor, and go out and
       fuss with your neighbor. Have you got anything? Uh-huh. No, sir. The only thing we got is a
       
       9
       lukewarm. As long as the music is running, we’re running. When the music stops, we stop.
       Brother, don’t call the other fellow something; let’s look around your own door, first. Amen. 176
       I tell you, we need an old-fashion revival like we used to have down in the country, when they
       lay on their face all night long. Not to carry on, but when real godly sorrow; and not go back
       to the altar and stay, but go out and make it right with the neighbors they had made it wrong
       with, and get straightened up. You know that’s right. Scorching, but, brother, it’ll help you.
       That’s right. You’ve got to know that, my friend. Yes, sir. 177 A lukewarm, that’s a horrible
       condition for the church to be in. You don’t watch, the Branham Tabernacle is about in that
       same sway. Listen, you know these things. It’s been taught, year after year, after year, after
       year, over this platform, warning you of these things coming. When, the Bible said there would
       be a time they’d go from the east to the west, and north and south, trying to find the true Word
       of God, and fail to find It. You better get anchored, where you know where you’re standing.
       178 But when a man is once borned again; not emotionally worked up, not some enthusiasm, not
       by putting his name on a church book, not by joining the biggest church in the city. But when
       he’s actually cried through, and begged, with tears in his eyes, until God has forgive his sins,
       cleansed his soul up from a life of sin, and filled him with the Holy Spirit; with such love, and
       godly, till he takes them old tire tools back, he stole from the neighbors, and goes and makes up
       to these things, and lives godly before men. We’ll never have a revival in this country till we
       have that. [Brother Branham knocked on the pulpit four times—Ed.] 179 Judgment begins at the
       house of God, by the Word of God. Amen. Not a textbook, but the Bible. Not what some church
       teaches in their theology, but what God says. Then you’ll have a revival where great powers,
       and wonders, and signs, and miracles, and everything else, will take place. 180 We’re
       lukewarm. Because we’re lukewarm in this age, God said, “I’ll spue you from My mouth.”
       This church age will be rejected. There’ll be a remnant out of it, that’ll be saved. So better
       mark yourself, right good, to find out if you’re in that remnant now. We’ll get into it in a
       minute, if God willing. Just notice now.
        The angel of the Lord come to him and said, they will not eat my bread any longer. The angel
       of the Lord come to him and showed him a vision of where John the Baptist had been baptizing
       and they had turned it into a hog lot. And the sows were giving birth to pigs turned around and
       ate their own after birth. He said, do you know what these are? No sir Lord! He said that’s your
       tabernacle, that’s your tabernacle.

       62-0908 - Present Stage Of My Ministry
       William Marrion Branham
       3 But I have come to this place that I want to explain what stage of time we’re living in
       according to the ministry that the Lord give me. And I wanted to record it from the tabernacle. It
       came on my heart last spring, but I waited till I got back here so I could get a—a recording of it,
       to send it to you peoples of the world. 4 It’s been about thirty-two years ago, that when the Lord
       Jesus, within a hundred and fifty yards of where I’m present standing now, here in Jeffersonville
       at Eighth and Penn Street, the morning when I laid the cornerstone on this tabernacle, just being
       then merely a swamp. And I lived just across the way to my left here. It was before I was
       married. I was living with my father and mother. That the Lord Jesus woke me up the morning
       
       10
       that the cornerstone was to be laid, about early, about six o’clock. And I had been lying in bed
       for some time, with my heart full of joy, thinking of this great time that the Lord God was going
       to give me a tabernacle to preach in. I was merely a young boy then. And that day I…the girl that
       I was going with, which was soon to be my wife the following year, was to be with us the day we
       was to lay the cornerstone. 5 And I remember that morning when I had wakened up, and
       laying in the room, the upstairs right here on Seventh Street. Something said, “Rise up to your
       feet.” And I got up. And I saw, as it was, a great place, and it was like a—a—a place where
       they would…a river run in the valley. And I got down there to the river and I understood it
       was a place where John the Baptist had been baptizing the people, and they had turned it into
       a hog lot. And I was very critical of it, just saying that it should not be done. 6 And while I was
       there, there was a—a Voice spoke to me and took me up, and I noticed this tabernacle in just
       about the state it’s in right now. But there were so many people till they were just packed all
       in, in the tabernacle, in this condition, about the state it’s at now. And I—I was happy, standing
       behind the pulpit, saying, “God, how good You are to give me a tabernacle.” 7 And, at that time,
       the Angel of the Lord spake to me, and said, “But this is not your tabernacle.” And I said,
       “Then, Lord, where is my tabernacle?” 8 And He taken me up in the Spirit again, and set me
       down in a grove. And way down the grove was just rows of trees setting just level, about twentyfeet tall, or thirty. And they looked like fruit trees, and they were in great big green buckets. 9
       And then I noticed to my right hand and to my left hand, there was an empty bucket on either
       side, and I said, “What about these?” 10 And He said, “You’re to plant in them.” So I pulled a
       limb from the tree to my right and placed it in a bucket on the right side, and a limb from the left
       hand and placed it in a bucket on the left side. Quickly they growed all the way into the skies. 11
       And He said, “Hold out your hands and gather the fruit thereof.” And in one hand fell a great
       yellow apple, mellow and ripe. And in the other hand fell a great yellow plum, mellow and ripe.
       And said, “Eat the fruit thereof, because it’s pleasant.” And I ate from one and from the other,
       very delicious. You know the vision, it’s wrote in one of the books, I think, Life Story, or Prophet
       Visits Africa. 12 And just then I held up my hands, and was shouting the glory of God. And all of
       a sudden, that Pillar of Fire came down over the top of those trees, and the roar and the
       lightnings flashed, and the winds blew real hard, and the leaves begin to blowing from the trees.
       And I looked way down, here stood the shape of this tabernacle, the way it sets now. And at the
       end where the pulpit would be, there were three trees, and those three trees taken shape of three
       crosses. And I noticed that both plums and apples were gathered in a clusters around the middle
       cross. And I ran real fast, screaming to the top of my voice, and fell down upon this cross, or by
       the cross, and threw my arms around it. And the winds begin to shake, and the—the fruit from
       the cross, and it fell all over me. And I was so happy, just rejoicing. And It said, “Eat the fruit
       thereof, because it’s pleasant.” 13 And then this circling of Fire called out, said, “The harvest is
       ripe, and the laborers are few.” And He said, “Now, when you come to yourself again, or come
       out of this, read Second Timothy 4. Second Timothy 4.” And then I came to myself. And I stood
       there rubbing my face and my hands. And just then, in the corner of the room, sun shining high,
       then I must have been under the vision for some hour or more, and It said, “Second Timothy 4.”
       And I reached quickly for my Bible, and read Second Timothy 4. 14 Now, I wish to read that
       now. And as strange as it seems, as I read this Second Timothy 4, the place that I stopped, and
       many times that I’ve preached on that here in this tabernacle, it seems strange that I’d always
       stop on that. Now in Second Timothy 4, the first five verses. Which, five is the number of
       “grace.” I read this. I charge thee…before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge
       the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in
       
       11
       season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the
       time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall
       heap…shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away
       their ears from the truth, and shall be turned into fables. But watch thou in all things, endure
       afflictions, and do the work of an evangelist, and make full proof of thy ministry. 15 Did you
       ever notice, and I never noticed it till this last May, I never read any more of that Scripture until
       there? That’s all I ever read of it ’cause that seemed like that it—it was suffices, because it was
       telling me to preach the Word and to endure afflictions, and to be longsuffering, for the time was
       coming when they would not endure sound Doctrine, but after their own lusts shall heap
       teachers, having itching ears, and would be turned from Truth unto fables. But, now, He never
       said I was an evangelist. He said, “Do the work of an evangelist.” Paul telling Timothy, see. Did
       you notice how it says? He didn’t say, “Now, you have been called to be an evangelist.” It said,
       “Do the work of an evangelist.” See? Now, we notice there then. Now, if I would say with all my
       heart and the best of my knowledge, that has been fulfilled to the letter. Just exactly. And that’s
       thirty years ago.

       296 And I was watching myself do it. And then when I was standing there, looking, and watching
       myself preach It. 297 And I was just preaching, to-who-wouldn’t-have-it. And after a bit, I raised
       up, you know, and I thought, “Glory to God!” I said, “Look at these wonderful things, and this,
       that!” 298 Directly, I noticed the people begin to get like they was physically hungry. And so
       they had enough spiritual, so they started walking away. And some of them…[Brother
       Branham yawns—Ed.] Started walking away. I thought, “What’s the matter with everybody?”
       299 And—and I looked, and here some young couples going along, to my side. I thought…I
       said, “Just a minute, friend! Just a minute! You’ll be back again when the evening shadows
       fall.” See? I said, “You’ll be back again. But let me give you this first climax. Where does all
       these things come from, that I’ve showed you? Where are they from?” I said, “Here they are.
       They are in the Word of God. They are THUS SAITH THE LORD, His promise. Cause,” I
       said, “all of you bear me record, witness this, that my commission is, ‘Stay with the Word.’” I
       said, “What’s the matter with all of you? Can’t you understand the Word? You must understand
       It.” 300 And some of them said, “Man, I’d like to have some biscuits,” and so like that. 301
       Well, I just thought, “Well, glory to God! If they want biscuits, let them go get them.” 302 So I—I
       turned around. I thought, “Oh, but, you know what? The shadows is going to fall, after while,
       right away.” I said, “Then, tonight, when that congregation gathers in again, I’ll put the climax
       to them, and told them that the things that they have seen me do is found in the Word of God, not
       in some mythical book or some organization. It’s found in the Word. See? Every bit of it, in the
       Word, ’cause I’m commissioned to That.” 303 I thought, “You know, they’ll, every one, be back
       tonight, so here is what I’ll do. I’ll background, kind of background.” You know the way I do it
       on these church ages and things, say what I said before. “I’ll background it, on the Word, and
       then this great, marvelous climax.” I said, “What a time it’ll be! Praise be to God!” And I seen
       myself getting real little, and heard that, “Praise be to God.” I seen myself fading up like that.
       And here I was, standing there.
       
       12
        And what happen? The angel of the Lord sent him west. And the drains come in the church
       and the lights went out on the left-hand side and we know that was the Tabernacle. And I ask you
       where are they today? Brother Branham said, “You’ll either press and strive and struggle to
       come into an ole saint Paul holy ghost revival or you’ll die and eat a rotten dead apple all the rest
       of your life.” Now I ask you, what did they do? What happen to them?

       56-0527 - At Kadesh-Barnea
       William Marrion Branham
       130 The people, at the hour of decision now! You’ve got to make up your mind. This church
       has got to make up its mind. Every man comes to a place where there’s a crucial hour. There
       was a crucial time come where you had to make up your mind. A judgment seat, you was at. You
       had to say, “I am guilty,” or, “I am not guilty.” When you’re standing before the judge, you’ve
       got to make up your mind. 131 And, tonight, the Branham Tabernacle has got to make up its
       mind. We’re either going to go on or go back. That’s right. You’re going back to garlic and—
       and leek, and stuff of Egypt, or you’re going on to Angels’ food, to the promised land where God
       made a promise. We’re going on to an old-fashion, Holy Ghost revival; or you’ll be wishwashy, packing around, and pecking like a robin on an apple, until the day you die. You’ve got
       to make your decision. You can’t go on. “Why halt ye between two opinions?” said Elijah.
       “God be God, serve Him. If He’s not God, then don’t serve Him.”
        Do you think that we could be any different? Let me tell you something, the scriptures are
       still the scriptures, God is able for these stones to raise up children to receive this revival. He’s
       able for these stones to do it! And if we don’t do it, he’s able to raise up these stones to do it. He
       don’t need you and I. See! We’re wrong and he’s right! We’re wrong and he’s right! The word
       of God is always right. Whether it’s the pastor right down to the least member in the
       congregation. God’s not gonna lower his standards. See, a lot of times…Now, I got some things
       want to say on that.
        A lot of times see, we make excuses for our self and try to lower God down to our standards.
       We try to make him come down and lower his standards and let us in and he’s not goin to. See!
        It’s just like, there I was shirking my responsibility one morning…A lot of times the Lord will
       speak to me like he does William. And a lot of times, and then the devil comes right around and
       speaks to me. See! The Lord will speak to William, then turn around and the devil will speak to
       him. He’ll come and repent and say, “I know I got to do this” Then the devil turns around and
       says, “Well, it’s grace.”
        See, that’s just like Paul when he preached, grace. And then somebody says, “Oh wonderful I
       can just get by with the way I’m living!” “What? Who said that? He said, “God forbid, shall we
       live any more longer in unbelief, just so that we might see the grace of God abound in our life.”
       No sir! No sir you see. No!
       Romans 6:15-Reference quote:
       4 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
       15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
       
       13
        If we’re really foreordained and called of God, we’ll work out our salvation with fear and
       trembling. We’ll face up under our responsibility. We will be the people that will pray.
        Don’t you realize death is sitting in across the land. Some of the churches used to be on fire,
       having service three days a week, having prayer meetings and fasting and cryin to God tryin to
       get a move of the Holy Ghost. They’re dying! Cutting out their services, cutting out their
       Wednesday night service, cut out their Sunday night service. Just come to service one day a
       week.
        And don’t you know, if we’ll go on like we’re doin and fail to press and strive and cry, seek
       the Lord God with all of our hearts. And the Pastor don’t say nothing about it, and he goes ahead
       and hides that. See, he shirked his responsibility, I shirk my responsibility and then I go ahead
       and let you shirk your responsibility saying, “Now God will do it, you all moved up here and
       God will do this thing.” See! And I’ll go on and hide from it and let you hide from it, then the
       next thing you know you’ll wake up and he’ll be gone. You say, “But Lord, you predestinated
       this!” Ya, he did! He gave us a chance to do it, and he knows we wouldn’t do it and he up and
       done it down here and we missed it all.
        Hasn’t that the way its always been in the word of God? Now, if we are gonna get a revival
       and I believe we will. Its Gods will, to wake us up this morning. It’s God’s grace to us to wake
       us up this morning, see.
        One morning, God kept speaking to me down in West Virginia and I wasn’t pressing and
       striving. I didn’t know all this great revelation was layin there and I thought I had revelation.
       And there I was, here God called me to be his servant and you know about it. He called me in
       1958 and I stood there in his presence and heard his voice. And then here, me there in West
       Virginia… George Parelli was down there, building me a little ole room up in the attic for me.
       And me layin around there, just shirking my responsibility. And every morning as soon as I wake
       up, I’d hear a still small voice speak to me and say, “You’re shirking your responsibility! You’re
       a slothful servant!” And then boy, I’d start cryin. Then right away the devil would say, “That
       ain’t the Lord, that’s just you! See, you know the Lord loves you! Why…” And then one
       morning there it come to me again, every morning. That same scripture come back to me.
       “You’re burying your talents in the sand! You’re burying your talents in the sand, you slothful
       servant you!” Well, that was kinda hard, see. A lot of times we don’t want to say hard things, but
       sometimes we have to say them. See! They’re the only…They’ve got to be said! And the Lord
       had to say those things to me. And then the devil would say, “Oh, that ain’t the Lord!” And then
       one morning, he come again the same scripture. Then immediately come the story just as clear as
       a bell. The whole story about the young prophet. And of course, he was typing that with me, I
       was his young servant in training to be that, you know. And it’s one thing to be in training and
       it’s another thing for it to be operating, you know. So, there I was in training and here the Lord
       said, like the young prophet. And he went down there and he didn’t do what the Lord told him to
       do. And the Lord told me what to do! He told me to be still and be quiet and the Holy Ghost
       would come and give me his revelation of his word. And I wouldn’t do it, I was always busy
       doin this and doin that, shirking running from it, see. I didn’t want to pay the price, is what it
       was! And so running from my responsibility and there he gave me that story of the young
       prophet. And then he said, because the young prophet didn’t obey him, he said, “The lion killed
       him” And he told that to me. And I started cryin and repenting, Vehemently. And then after I got
       through repenting and cryin, why then another voice spoke to me and said, “The Lord loves you
       too much, remember when he appeared to you he said, He loved you! Even though you we’re a
       sinner he loved you. You know, he loves you too much he wouldn’t do that to you. I mean he
       
       14
       loves you more than that young prophet, he wouldn’t do that to you.” That was the devil! That’s
       the devil! And right then I begin to think, “Ya I don’t have to…” See, I begin to pull back in my
       heart. And boy, immediately like a bomb shell hit me! He said, “I told my major prophet that he
       would be a bum on a dump. And if he hadn’t repented and come on and do what was his
       responsibility, I would of made him a bum on a dump.” Now, that was a major prophet!

       63-0623M - Standing In The Gap
       William Marrion Branham
       17 So he went to sleep, and I went speeding down the road, about fifty-five miles an hour, in the
       truck, over the mountain, coming on towards the—the border, down to…Coming home to
       Arizona, but I was coming now into Utah. And as I got there, coming down from the mountains,
       about twenty miles out of the city, just as if…You’ve heard it, as I told you about the morning
       about the squirrels, and all these things, how something…Somebody went to talking to me, a
       Voice just the same as you hear mine. I know it sounds neurotically. But as I’ve got through
       expressing, “Have I ever told you anything but what was right?” And a—a Voice got to talking. I
       was talking to Him. 118 It said, “Carry out your plans and you’ll be like that.” I said, “Lord, I
       don’t want to be like that.” 119 Said, “Your wife will go, too. She won’t live up there in them
       hills like that. And you’ll become a bum just as the dream showed you you would.” 120 I said,
       “I don’t want to be that, but the…I—I—I don’t want to have to live like that. I—I want to do
       something different. But I—I was told that—that You had called me to be a—a prophet, and I
       want to live in the wilderness like the prophet.” But I was using my own excuse so I could
       hunt; my own good. 121 And He said, “But that was the prophets of the Old Testament. You’ve
       been called to be there in a much higher office than that.” He said, “You have more gifts besides
       that. You was called to pray for the sick and to preach the Gospel. And in the apostolic form, you
       know of—of greater things, many great gifts.” He said, “Why do you wait for Me to move you
       every time you move? Where is your reward?” Then I seen. And then said, “Do you remember?”
       I told you…?… “Do you remember what Brother Roberson told you in your dream, in his dream,
       or vision? That you had done like Moses. You’ve forgot the feeling of your people. You forgot the
       call that I called you to.”
        Now, do you think he’ll let William get by? Do you think he’ll let Brother Lambert get by? Or
       let you get by? Do you believe he loved Brother Branham? He healed the sick cleansed the
       lepers and raised the dead. Did he fast and pray? When he was out on the field, he weighed but a
       hundred and seventeen pounds, hardly ate a meal! Was he away from home six to eight months,
       at a time and never seen his wife and children? He’d come back and his children would hardly
       even know him. And after he gave his body as a livin sacrifice, he was goin up in the wilderness.
       And the Lord said, “You go up there and you’ll be a bum on a dump.” How many believe he’d
       be a bum on a dump? How many here want to be a bum on a dump? He could turn every one of
       us here to a bum on a dump! See!
        There you balance out your predestination. If we are called…If we are called to get this
       revival and I believe we are, we’re gonna straighten up and do right. From the preacher to all the
       way down. I ain’t got no excuse, I ain’t got no excuse to be down. I can’t find no excuse; I don’t
       excuse myself. Gods right and I’m wrong, see. I don’t care what the congregation does, I should
       
       15
       stay right on top all the time and press and strive and struggle, cryin, pressing God, right on. See!
       I’ve got a responsibility to God; I’ve got to bare up under it. And woe is me! I don’t want to hear
       that Voice, “Thou slothful servant!” But I may hear it! I may hear it! I don’t want to hear it. I
       want to be a faithful servant of God. How many here, want to be faithful? (Amen) We can be
       unfaithful, see sure!
        Paul said, “I fear least after I would preach to others, that I myself be a castaway!” He said, “I
       fear! I have a great fear that after I’ve preached this great revelation, that I myself be a
       castaway.”
       1 Corinthians 9:27-Reference quote;
       But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have
       preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
        That would be pitiful, that after I brought all this revelation, then I’d get so cold in God and
       backslid, no longer stay in prayer and in the word of God. Unless I quickly, quickly wake myself
       up and press and strive and struggle, that’s where I’ll be. So not only the congregation but the
       pastor to. See! I say, “Well, I’m just in a rut now and that’s what the matter with me. I’ve been
       here so long; it’s getting so common. It’s just so much preachin.” And oh God, that’s so wrong!
       Just to think that God has bless me and give me this great revelation. I ought to be the most…I
       ought to be red hot for God. I ought to be striving and struggling! And if I stayed on my knees
       night and day and only eat one meal a week, it wouldn’t suffice, I couldn’t repay God! Any
       dedication and consecration that I’d give, is only my reasonable amount of service. And then
       after we’ve done all that, we’re just unprofitable children. Now we’ve got to wake up here, every
       one of us from the pulpit clear back to the back where Brother William’s sittin.
        God knows in my heart, I ain’t no respecter of persons. It’s one thing, if you’ve been here any
       length of time in this congregation, you know that your pastor is not a respecter of persons. I tell
       you the truth, because I love you. I’ll be long suffering with you, but there is coming a time when
       every one of us, has got to bare up under it and do it. For today, is the day of salvation, see. We
       don’t have no time to put off…Saying, “We’ll wait till the world council of Churches do
       something, then we’ll get desperate.” The revelation should cause us to get desperate. When we
       see God’s revelation and the greatness of it, and see what he called us to be, it ought to cause
       everyone to really bare up under our responsibility and seek the Lord Jesus with all of our heart.
        Now, I believe it’s nothing but Gods sovereign grace, to come like he did this morning. Come
       like he did this morning. And I feel that I said… I sit there praying all morning, while I was
       sitting there, that God would tell me what to say. And whatever I said, I feel that was God!
        Don’t you never let the devil put into your mind, that you’ve got security! That you got
       security, just because you’ve got a minister that’s got revelation. Don’t you never rest day or
       night, till you get the Token! That’s your security, that’s my security, that’s all of us. We’ll have
       rest in our souls, when we receive “The Rest” and not until. You’re not to rest! There is no rest!
       He said, “Come unto me all ye that labor in prayer and the word of God and I will give you rest!
       But you go right on laboring in the word of God and prayer and I’ll give you rest; my yoke is
       easy and my burden is light!” “Come unto me all that are heavy laden” Your supposed to be
       heavy laden. And the only way that you’ll find rest is, come in and get that “Rest!” How do you
       get it? By one Holy spirit are you gonna be Baptized into the body of Christ. Can the
       congregation say, amen? (Amen)
       
       16
       Matthew 11:28-Reference quote:
       28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
       29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find
       rest unto your souls.
       30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
        Now, we’re gonna start off a new this morning. We’re gonna start a new sheet! We’re gonna
       ask God to forgive all of our slothfulness, from the pastor clear down to the back of the church.
       Renew our faith, renew our courage, and help us to bear up under our responsibility that we have
       to go out and get a revival, for the sake of the little Bride.
        Remember children, she’s dead and dried up around the country. Brother Don (Ruddell) and
       Brother Mike (Canada) and brother Bob (Gatlian) said, “That this is the only place where there
       is any life at all.”
        Wouldn’t it be terrible if, Brother Mike wouldn’t have a little refuge place to come to and get
       refreshed? Did you know those brothers can’t hardly wait till they can get back up here, to stand
       before you to feel your zeal? Wouldn’t it be sad…It’s bad enough to see the brothers come, the
       ministers come burden down and heart ache with their wives weary and just be ragged and their
       spirit just be like sand…And be just like an ole nerve in a tooth just a throbbing…And they say,
       brother Lambert you don’t know what it is, it’s just like a breath from heaven to come into your
       assembly and stand before them saints. Now what if everybody…Now just think what if there
       was no Teddy’s in this group? Just what if there wasn’t? There wouldn’t be nothing for God’s
       servants to come to.
        What if we all just said, “It all rests in predestination and we all just sit down and want to
       sleep till Jesus comes? Why, there wouldn’t be nothing for nobody to come to. I couldn’t preach
       one sermon. I couldn’t go on and I’d die, you’d die and what have ya? And I believe with all my
       heart…I believe with all my heart…I was tellin the Lord last night, “Lord if I go to Africa, could
       I find any better material then I got here?” Surely God, we can wake up and get this great thing!
       See!
        Wouldn’t it be sad for Brother Mike and them come and recognize by the holy spirit that you
       failed? What would they do? Here all down through Georgia they bare the reproach for you, their
       scorned, their mocked, their ridiculed. They’re spoke evil of night and day, is because they brag
       on you continually. Your faith and your zeal and your love for the word of God and devotions to
       God, are spoke of all through the south by God’s servants. What an honor that is! And what
       a…and what a reproach they carry!
        Your pastors got the nastiest name of any preacher, that walks the earth today. But then
       there’s men’s who’s lives that are irreproachable, that Brother Branham taught, like Brother
       Ruddell. Not a greater man that walks in shoe leather, than that man. And there he speaks so
       highly of you and bares a reproach.
        Now once where he had, everybody in the country wanting him to come and preach for them
       and overseas and everything, just because he spoke of by Brother Branham. Now nobody wants
       him! He goes to tape meetings where he used to have crowds around him talking to him,
       telephone ringing night and day to take him out to dinner and just to come and see them. Now
       nobody calls him. Friends that once loved him turns their back, why because of you and because
       of me.
        What if we let down, we let down and then end up just cold and formal no zeal no life? Now
       we don’t want to do that. How many wanting our testimony even ringing stronger, and he’s only
       
       17
       coming to that kind of people. He’s only coming to that kind of a people, see. Love is fire! Love
       is fire!
        And he’s coming after a Bride, who’s love is just red hot, fiery. Fiery red-hot love, just so
       desperate for him to come, just so in love with him. And that’s who he comes to! The
       Bridegroom is coming to the Bride. How many understand that? The Bridegroom is that the most
       excitable, most joyful, most joyous, most stimulating event in your whole life? And to think
       now, this is what’s gonna happen, the Bridegroom is ready to come to you!
        And can you imagine that here we believe, that we’re gonna get sealed, and here we’re all
       slumped down. All of our hands are hanging down, can’t pray, can’t worship the Lord, don’t feel
       like it. Brother Branham said, “Why don’t you feel like it? Why don’t you feel like worshipping
       the Lord? Why can’t you pray?” He said, “Does not a wife yield herself to her husband. If she
       has to yield herself to the husband then why can’t you yield yourself to the Lord?” Oh He said, “I
       would but you wouldn’t” He’s right and we’re wrong. There’s much shadow of turning in us, but
       no shadow of turning in God! We’re wrong and he’s right!
       James 1:17-Reference quote:
       17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of
       lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
        We must, we must, we must eat his word and drink his blood to receive his spirit. Now God
       bless you, now let’s remember his week. I’m gonna consecrate myself anew to the Lord this
       week. We pray that possibly, Brother Ruddell and Brother Mike Canada and be with us this
       week. If we don’t have a preaching service Saturday night, we’ll come here to expect God to
       pour out his spirit. Come and worship him with all of our hearts and with all of our might and all
       of our soul. Let’s bind his word upon our minds, and in all of our hearts. Let’s memorize these
       scriptures and quote his words, speak his psalms and sing his hymns. Worship him all the day
       long. And rejoice and be glad because the marriage of the Lamb has come. Now we know the
       end-time is near, that’s what I’ll speak upon this morning.
        Now, Brother William I didn’t want to say that to you, I love Brother William and I want to
       wake him up, see. So, God help Brother William and God help us all, pastor and everybody.
        I’m thankful to God, that the little brothers that I talked to, are straightening that up now.
       Don’t let there ever be a click among us. See, don’t feel any more towards Brother Jim
       Rosenberry then you would for Brother Bill (Malison,) see. Love one another with a holy ghost
       love and a holy ghost love is without partiality. I can say I think the Lord for that. You see!
        One time in this congregation, I lost seventy percent of my congregation, because I love Bill
       Malison and William, see. I said, “No sir! No Sir! I believe those are children of God and God
       didn’t give them to me to destroy but to help them.” See! And I love every one of you! There’s
       not a one of you that I love, more than the other one. But brother sister, God has called me to tell
       you, when your right and when you’re wrong. And if I ever say anything to you that’s outside of
       Godly love and respect to make you what you ought to be, then that’s not right. But I do it out of
       Godly love, see. A normal minister wouldn’t say, what I say this morning. But I’m made up to
       say it. I’m made up I can only say the truth. Whether it hurts me or hurts anybody, I’ll tell you
       the truth. And that proves to me, that I love you that I’d tell you the truth.

       61-0210 - Abraham's Covenant Confirmed
       William Marrion Branham
       116 But notice in building the pyramid… Now, watch this. You got a dollar bill in your pocket?
       I—I think I got one. So if you notice on the back of your dollar bill, why have they got the
       pyramid says, “The Great Seal?” You ever notice it on your American dollar? Um-hum. “The
       Great Seal.” Notice on that pyramid also, how it starts at the bottom and keeps coming up like
       this, minority, minority. And did you notice, the capstone’s not even on it. Neither is the pyramid
       capped. Why? The Capstone was rejected, Jesus Christ, the Head of it, exactly right. 117 Now,
       notice, in the Lutheran age, what did we live? Justification, way down here at the bottom,
       planting the foundation stones, Luther; Wesley, we believed in sanctification, to come into the
       minority; Pentecost, still the baptism of the Holy Ghost, up in the minority. But watch, the
       Church that goes right out to the end of it, right out at the end of that, that Church is going to
       have to be so perfectly like the ministry of Jesus Christ, till when that stone comes, it sets right
       smack in the groove. Oh, Hallelujah! Oh. 118 If you can catch it and know what I’m talking
       about, the very ministry that Jesus Christ was doing here on earth, when it comes back, the
       very same ministry He had, Pentecost will not have to widen itself out in organization, but
       shape itself up in Christ until the Headstone and the Church will fit one to the other. And
       them is so cemented, till you can’t even take a razor blade and go around and find the crack
       where they were put together. And that’s how the Church is got to come, so much like Christ.
       And look what we got to do then. Cut away and circumcise and chop off, and form and molded
       into the image of Jesus Christ until that Church and the Cap comes right smack together. 119
       Look at my hand on a shadow on the wall. When it’s away from me, it’s scattered out. As it
       comes, it becomes more closer. There’s not a great big fingers, it’s getting smaller and smaller
       and smaller, getting darker and darker and darker, until the shadow, the negative and the
       positive becomes one. And that’s the way it is in the Coming, the Church has got to shape itself
       till it hasn’t got a spot or wrinkle in it. Amen. There is that second Bible. 120 The third one’s
       wrote on paper because this is that great educational age that we’re living in. And neither will
       none of them contradict one another. So you see, the great solar system speaks of Christ.
       Everything that you see speaks of Christ if you just look at it. Look at the church today in its
       condition, weak, backslidden, gone back into the world. That speaks of Christ, exactly what He
       said. He’d stand at the door and knock. And that, put outside, organized Him out, and set Him
       outside; our creeds and so forth took Him out. But He still stand at the door and knocking and
       said, “Everyone I love, I chasten and rebuke.” That’s right. Trying to cut them down and
       bring them to a spot to where when the great Capstone comes, the ministry that’s in the
       church and the Capstone will just come right straight together like a magnet. They will just
       seal right in together. Oh, God, help us to have… It’ll be there; don’t worry; it’ll be there. He
       said it would be there. So let’s us fit ourselves to meet that Cornerstone. Let us love and project
       our lives in Christ and be sincere and stay with the Word, until when He comes we just fit
       right in like the glove over the hand, like that, with Him. Oh, that’s the Church that God is
       waiting for. Yes, sir.
        And I believe that we have the chance, and I believe that we are closer and I believe that God
       has called us here for the purpose, of an outpouring of the Holy Ghost. But for the past few
       
       19
       weeks, the last month things have been goin wrong. The spirit has moved in this congregation,
       that before would of never had a chance to do it. And I’ve warned you right from the pulpit, stop
       don’t do that and it went right on and even got worse.
        So now, let us all strive to keep the unity of the holy spirit. Because it’s your soul, it’s your
       soul it’s my soul this is each one of us involved, it’s eternal life. So, let us strive and struggle to
       lay aside every weight of sin that so easily besets us. Each one of you got some sin that’s easily
       besetting you. Lay that aside! Lay that aside!
        And just like as a great dam would break, like in Utah some of those bolder dams that carry
       billion of tons of water and you lived at the foot of it. Lived in that house and if you know that
       dam could break any minute, you’d live like it was gonna break any minute. And let you and I
       live every day and every hour, just like that Jesus would come for us that day. And not let our
       own sins and our own spiritual laziness…And remember this is the laziest, laziest people of God
       that’s ever been upon the earth is the Laodicean, Lazy-Laodicean’s. How many want to come out
       of that spirit? (Amen) God help us to come out of that thing. I pray God lead us, into some allnight prayer meeting like we had last year.
        Brother Branham said, I want to see the church get back to all night prayer meetings.” And
       always remember this…Always remember this, keep it as a guide line to your spiritual life. The
       less you read the word of God, the less you want to. The less you pray the less you want to pray.
       The more you read the word of God, the more you’ll want to read the word of God. The more
       you sing, the more you’ll want to sing.
        How many was just so down and grouchy and moody that you could hardly even sing the
       name of Jesus? And then you just made yourself to start singing, and then you start feeling
       better. Just say praise the Lord, you don’t feel like it, just praise him anyways! Cause he said,
       “Offer a sacrifice,” Even if it’s a sacrifice to do it! Praise him, see. Then it’ll get easier, see.
        And Brother Branham said, “And as I pray to God I say, Lord give me a burden to pray.” I
       don’t have no burden to pray, but I have a spiritual moral responsibility to stay in this message.
       This is my…this is how I serve God! I don’t serve God by coming to your house and talking to
       you. I can’t serve God that way, that hinders God. The only way that I can serve God, is that I
       stay alone with his word and in prayer. And cry to God for you, to give you what you need. Give
       you the water, give you the spirit, give you the word. Let me say the right things that you need,
       like I’m sayin this morning. Let me say that!
        You know now I could get to love you, and really love you and I get to feel'in sorry for you,
       because I kinda take the paddle and spank you then I’d shirk my duty, then I didn’t love you
       then. But now if I take you and tell you the truth, and I chastise you when you need it, and put oil
       in your cuts and your wounds when they need it. See! Then I’ve proved to the Lord by staying in
       prayer and in the word of God. Then I prove to the Lord Jesus that I love you.
        And what did Jesus say, “Bob all that’s ever come before me…This is what he told me one
       time, he said, “Bob, all that ever come before me was thieves and robbers, Thieves and robbers!”
       (Brother Lambert weeps) He said, “I wouldn’t give them my revelation, because they didn’t love
       my sheep. All them that ever come before me was those kind of preachers, nothing but thieves
       and robbers.” Then he said, “Therefore, my sheep didn’t hear their voice.” But then he said,
       “You love my sheep and I’ve give you my revelation, and they’ll hear you! They’ll hear you!”
       And have you not heard? (Amen) Because of the love, the love of God. God knows his servants
       love his sheep. Because the message come to the Shepherd. It didn’t come to nobody else, but a
       God called Shepherd. He takes a God called shepherd, that he knows that will love his sheep.
       Because the Bible said, “A Shepherd love his sheep and layeth down in the gate, and protects the
       
       20
       sheep and loves the sheep and lays down his life. He loses his life and consecrates himself to
       nothing but the word and prayer. His whole life is centered around the sheep. And he said, that is
       the only man that I’ll give my revelation to. And my sheep will hear his voice, and another
       they’ll not follow, see. And he said, I put the sheep forth, go ye into all the world and preach the
       gospel and I goeth before them. I goeth before them!
       John 10:8-Reference quote:
       8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
       John 10:11-Reference quote:
       11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

       64-1221 - Why It Had To Be Shepherd
       William Marrion Branham
       81 Jesus Christ is not dead, He’s alive. He’s here today! The Bible said, “He’s the same
       yesterday, today, and forever.” He said, in Saint John 14:12, “He that believeth on Me…” (not
       he that makes-believe, he that says he believes) “He that believeth on Me, the works that I do
       shall he do also. And more than this shall he do, because I go to the Father.” And I’ve seen
       Him, in my own life, do more of the same works (that He did then) than is written in the pages of
       this Bible. And it goes over the top of the head and the wise today, and revealed to babes such as
       will learn; as Jesus prayed for. It is true, He’s done more than He…I’ve seen in my day, of my
       thirty-three years of ministry, I’ve seen Him do more than I have read of Him doing in the Bible;
       more of the same thing. 82 But no matter what He did then, do you think the Sanhedrin believed
       Him? “Well,” they said, “you’re bewitched.” But, find out, where they made their mistake was
       to find out…in finding out, not what their creed said, but what the Word said Messiah would do
       in their day. And there’s where we make the mistake today, not searching the Scriptures. Jesus
       told them, “Search the Scriptures, in Them you think you have Eternal Life, and They are
       They that testify of Me. They tell you Who I am.” 83 Notice, God foreknew they would do this,
       that’s just the why He had to take It to shepherds. He knew they wouldn’t do it, they wouldn’t
       receive It. Now do you see why it had to be shepherds? Why shepherds? Theologians wouldn’t
       receive It. Why shepherds again? Would It come contrary to His Word? No! They were
       shepherds, they knowed sheep; and that’s what He was borned, a sheep, a lamb. Notice, He
       was the Lamb. They were—they were the only kind that would accept Him. A shepherd was
       the only thing would accept a Lamb. They knowed how to take care of It, and so is it today
       when we get the Lamb’s Message. 84 Now the striking! The most humblest, uneducated man
       adoring Emmanuel in a stable. The most…And there were people out there, at the same days,
       teaching their theology. Great crowds, drawing everywhere, from all over the land, they come to
       sacrifices which Jehovah said was “a stench in His nostrils.” And here was humble shepherds,
       in a stable, adoring Emmanuel; God Himself made flesh, and laying in a stable. See, how we
       with our great learnings, and our head sticking back like we know something, and God bypasses
       the whole thing. See? He does what He promises to do, and He always does that. But think of
       
       21
       these lowly shepherds out there now adoring Emman-…Emmanuel in a stable. It’s most striking.
       Sure is!
        Now let’s remember these things children and keep them sacred to our heart. Love the Lord
       God with all of our heart. And not be weary in well doing, you see. Strive and to struggle, to
       make our assembly the power house of God. That the blind might see and the lame might walk
       and the dead might be raised. And then in the ultimate end, to see all the seven church ages
       resurrected from the dead and walking in among us. So now, God bless us, as these things that
       we said, we commit them to the Lord Jesus.
        Now open our Bibles. I think it’s getting a little warm in here brethren, I think if we can turn
       these air conditioners on.
        Now I may not be able to finish this here. But I’ll just start and maybe we’ll just finish it up
       tonight.
        If you’ll open your Bibles to a really blessed book, the book of Romans. The book of Romans
       the first chapter and the eighteenth verse.
        Now let’s ask God’s blessing upon the word.
       Our most loving heavenly father, we thank thee for the power of the Holy Ghost in our midst this
       morning. And we know Lord that this is because that you are pleased, Lord with the things that
       were said yesterday. The commitments that were made in the little brother’s hearts. Lord Jesus
       how we pray now, as we have confessed our sins to thee. As we enter in upon a new page and
       new day today, by the help and grace of God. We strive and struggle Lord in a dedication of the
       word of God in prayer and consecration in our bodies and in our minds and in our spirits and in
       our hearts. To purpose in our hearts to cleave to the Lord God his word. And bear up under our
       responsibility of keeping the word of God in prayer. And watching and waiting in a burning redhot love, for the Lord Jesus the Bridegroom to marry the Bride. Oh, God help us to be faithful to
       thee and not fail, that each one might hear in that day those blessed words, “Well done my
       faithful and good servant!” And God may it not be heard by any of our ears here this morning,
       “Thou slothful servant” And Lord Jesus may we not hear those words. For each one of us desire
       to hear, the best words. “Thou faithful and good servant” God grant it to each one of us! Now
       Lord, we believe that we are foreordained and predestinated Lord, to receive the great outpouring
       of the Holy Ghost. Help us now Lord, to prove that we are by the works. Let us prove our faith,
       by the works of our lives and the things that we do. May we prove to thee by our actions, that we
       love thee and adore thee with all of our hearts. From the least most feeble one from the back and
       to the front Lord, of this little assembly. May we each one be found faithful in Jesus name, amen.

       61-1112 - A True Sign That's Overlooked
       William Marrion Branham
       26 Father, God, we come in the Name of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Jacob: Jesus Christ
       the righteous. We come, knowing that He will hear us, because we come not as someone who
       had just come into the building, but we come boldly with faith, believing that what He has
       promised, that He will do. So we ask, today, Lord, that Thou would take each one of us that’s
       present, all the way from the pulpit to the back of the building, throughout all the areas, and
       open every heart and circumcise our hearing, that the Word of the living God might come
       forth from Heaven, this morning, and pour into our hearts, that we might believe, as we hear
       
       22
       the Word of the Lord and as has been read to us in our ears this morning. And we thank Thee
       for Thy Word. Thy Word is the Truth. 27 And now, as we see the evil hours approaching, all
       the wrath of God built up into the skies. And it’s most any time that there could be something
       happen to this nation that’s forsaken Thee, that there would be one great explosion that would
       take the nation completely off of the map of the world, with threats behind it, of an ungodly
       country that’s anxious to do so. And knowing that, instead of drawing nigh unto God, they
       seem to get further away. Knowing that the Book of the Revelation and all down through the
       Scriptures has predicted this day, then let us take warning, Lord, not be slothful and be laying
       sleepy, as it was. May we rise and shake ourselves. 28 May we have understanding, today, like
       we have never had before. May our hearts be so on fire, after this day, that there will be a
       kindled fire in our souls that’ll sweep through this country, Lord, and a living testimony
       wherever we are.
        Now, this book of Romans if we may if the Lord permitting us maybe on Sundays…Of
       course if I get another message I wanna preach, I’ll put it in there. But I think the book of
       Romans, is very timely and packed with great golden nuggets. It’s one of the greatest epistles in
       the Bible is the book of Romans. It’s one book, I never read much till I was older in the Lord.
       And I’ve come to appreciate the book of Romans, very greatly in these last past years.
        Now, notice that this first chapter of the book of Romans, is dealing with the Gentiles.
       Because it’s to the Romans. And the Roman centurion that was spoken of in the gospel was the
       type of the Gentiles. We’re the Gentiles like the Romans.
        And Paul is speaking to the last day Gentiles here, not only to those Roman Gentiles in the
       first day, but he’s speaking to those last day Gentile people. That’s us!
        And now the eighteenth verse, we want to read starting at the eighteenth verse. The rest of its
       real good, but I’ve preached on those four verses about the gospel of Christ. How many
       remembers that? I never did preach that scripture, on the gospel of Christ. “Believe on the Lord
       Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved”, that we always say. “For the wrath of God” …Verse 18
       now.
       Romans 1:18-Scripture Reading;
       18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
       men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
        Now let’s look at that scripture now. Now notice here, it’s speaking that the wrath of God is
       gonna be revealed from heaven. Now we know that Christ, is only in this last hour that he
       promised in the epistles of Thessalonians chapter four. First Thessalonians chapter four said,
       “That the Lord himself would descend from heaven”
       Thessalonians 4:16-Reference quote:
       6 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,
       and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
        And here Paul is saying that the Lord will be revealed from heaven in wrath. Now we know
       that this is the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first time he comes is a Lamb. He
       comes as a Lamb!
       
       23
        But the second coming he’s coming in Judgement, and authority and in power, see. And He
       said for Paul said, “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness, and
       unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;”
       Romans 1:18-Scripture Reading;
       18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
       men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
        Now remember the vision of Brother Branham where is seen the Bride out of step. And on
       other tape I can’t remember right now, my mind can’t. He said, “Remember keep her in step with
       judgement. Keep her in step with Judgement.” Said, “Remember the rock that I threw up out on
       the mountain there with Brother woods. And the Lord said, “Reach down there and pick up that
       rock and say, thus saith the Lord.” And he did that and you know the story of it. And he said,
       “When he picked up that rock, he said you have to do something for God to do something else.”
       He said, “When I threw up that rock, we entered into a new day into the judgements of God.”

       64-0705 - The Masterpiece
       William Marrion Branham
       Vision of the Bride out of step:
       Now I’m going to tell the vision. I don’t know that I can interpret it, but I—I’m going to tell the
       vision for my first time. 187 I fell into a trance. And, when I did, there was Somebody with me. I
       didn’t see the Person. It was just a Voice. And I—I looked. And as I—I looked this way, He said,
       “The Bride will come in view for preview.” And I looked, coming to me, and I seen the most—the
       most prettiest bunch of clean-dressed women I ever seen in my life. But each one of them, looked
       like, was dressed different. They all had long hair. And they were longer sleeves and skirts, and
       so forth. Young women, they looked kind of, I’d say, about maybe twenty. 188 Now I have the
       Bible open here before me. See? I can only say what I seen. If you say, “What are you looking
       at?” I’m looking at a clock. “What you looking for?” I’m looking for people, looking at people.
       “What are you looking at?” I’m looking at the Bible. That’s what. I’m telling the Truth. That’s
       what I see. And I can only say what I seen. I don’t—I don’t know what it…all about it. I just have
       to tell you. 189 But, when this Bride, She was looking right at…The one was talking to me, and I,
       standing together. Her eyes, She was the cleanest, sweetest-looking people I ever seen in my life.
       Look like it could have been a dozen, or more, just…I don’t know how many was abreast, but
       there just in a group of them. And She passed by, sweetly, with a air. And Her eyes up, watching,
       as She passed by. Oh, She was beautiful! I looked at Her, and as She passed by. He said, “Now
       we shall review…” Said, “That’s the Bride.” “Now we will review the churches.” And they
       come. I noticed them coming up. And when they come up, each one, look like, got worse. I never
       seen such a filthy bunch in my life. And when He said, “Next,” I heard a noise. And It said,
       “Next,” said, “here comes the American group.” 190 Now, I am an American, but this—this
       made me sick. I am not eloquent enough to, in a mixed audience, to say what was taking place.
       I—I—I…And you’ll have to read between the lines. But when the women were coming, the leader
       of them was a witch. She had a great long nose and a great big mouth. And all of them was
       dressed with some kind of lower clothes down here; but the top just had a strap, that, just a little,
       about a half-inch strap that moved up and went around them like this. And each women had
       
       24
       something on a order… 191 Many of you, years ago, used to remember when we used to cut that
       paper, you know, newspaper, and make an old fly-bush? How many remembers it? You know.
       Why, I think they use it in carnivals, you know. Hanging down like that, fringed paper, lace
       paper. They had something holding below them, like this, holding below them. All this part was
       exposed. And each one had hair cut up real short, and frizzy-looking things all over it like that,
       real short-cut hair; and full of makeup. Absolutely nothing but looked like street prostitutes. And
       they were walking with this paper, and, the vulgarity! Now, the paper was what was holding in
       front of them. But when they passed the review stand, in the back of them…And to see the way
       they were going on, in their foremost and their back part, and how they were acting! I said, “Is
       that the Church?” 192 And there she went. And they were singing this here twist-and-roll songs,
       you know, or ever what you call, going down, singing that and going by. I said, “Is that the
       Church?” And I was standing there, and in my heart I was crying. And, this witch, to my notion
       it’s nothing else in the world but she’s a…She is that World Council of Churches, leading them
       right straight down the road where she was going. They went off to the left, and disappeared in
       chaos; still beating this music and making real funny sounds, and shaking their bodies, one side
       and then the other side. And then, like that, carrying on like that, walking. 193 And I just started
       to bow my head, and He said, “Wait, the Bride must come again.” And I looked, and here they
       come again. And they passed by, a sweet-looking little ladies. They was all looking right at me,
       as they passed by. And I noticed each one was dressed different. And one in the back had kind of
       long hair hanging down, and had it rolled around like this; might have been German or
       something like that. And I watched them. And then as they started leaving, two or three of them,
       in the back, kind of get out of step, and I was going to holler at them. And they was trying to get
       back in step again. And I seen them, just the vision just fade out and change, from me. 194 Now
       here is the interpretation thereof. The reason…Now, remember, I had just got through writing…I
       hadn’t finished, I hadn’t wrote these notes yet. But in preaching, this morning, I caught what it
       was, right in my sermon. Did you notice, the church only came in view… Now, that’s the Truth,
       friends. The Heavenly Father, Who writes the Word, knows that I tell the Truth. See? I know I
       just say the Truth. And not knowing it till just a few minutes ago, looked like, or just recently,
       see. Did you notice? The Bride come in view twice; the first Seed and the second Seed, both of
       them exactly the same One. And the reason they were dr’iff…dressed in different parts, She’ll
       come from all nations, it’ll make up the Bride. Each one had long hair, and no makeup, and real
       pretty girls. And they were watching me. That represented the Bride coming out of all nations.
       See? She, each one represented a nation, as they marched perfectly in line with the Word. See?
       195 And, then, I have to watch Her. She’ll get out of step with that Word if I don’t watch, when
       She is passing by, if She gets by. Maybe it’ll be my time, when I’m over, see, when I’m finished,
       or whatever it is. 196 What? They was getting back. Trying their best, and was getting back, just
       get in line; ’cause, they—they was looking out somewhere else, watching about that church that
       just went out into chaos. But two…The front ones, never. The back ones, just two or three of
       them, was kind of stepped out a little bit to the right-hand side, and looked like was trying to get
       back in line as they went by. They was just past me, oh, far as here to the wall, past me. And I
       was standing there. And then I just seen it all move out and leave. But, you notice, the church
       only came into view once, each nation, the church. But the Bride come in twice. See, see what it
       was? Now, not knowing it, but look at it with my Message this morning. Not knowing that. See?
       197 The Seed fell in the ground at Nicaea. That was the original Seed. And She’s come through
       the process of these denominations, which only comes in existence once. But the Bride returns
       back again in the last days. “I will restore.” See, the Masterpiece is brought up. That’s the
       
       25
       reason She was in view, reviewed, the second time. She was reviewed the first time, then she was
       reviewed the second time. And She was perfectly, the second time, like She was the first time. O
       God, have mercy! Hurry, hurry, hurry, Life, get in the Grain, right quick! Uh-huh. 198 All others
       never appeared no more. They went out, never to come back again. But the Bride came back,
       ’cause She was Alpha and Omega. God, the great Sculptor, has made Him a Masterpiece, for It
       is a piece of His first Masterpiece. Like He made in the garden of Eden, and took a piece from,
       and made another piece and that was marred and fell, now He’s been all this time building it up
       again. And He brought forth this Masterpiece, and was smitten, in order…That part that was
       smitten, was in order to bring back again that Masterpiece, again. 199 So, the Masterpiece and
       the Son of God, the Masterpiece and the Bride, and It’s a piece of Him, which must be the
       fulfilling of the Word. The Word has been fulfilled, and we’re ready for the Coming of the Lord.
       200 O Church of the living God, bow your hearts and your—yourselves before God. These things
       are true. I know that it sounds like that, as such a great a thing as that would be, would be so
       spread out over the nations. It never was. He doesn’t change His way. Just be thankful, Church,
       be thankful that you are where you are today if you’re in Christ. Because, you see, now, and
       when that… 201 Remember, all that Life will be gathered right into the Grain, for the
       resurrection, but the stalk must be burned. The rest of it; the husk and all, must be destroyed, and
       it will be. Don’t trust in your, them denominations. You stay in the Word, the Life, God and His
       Masterpiece. 202 Then what is it in the Millennium? Christ and His Bride, back in the garden of
       the Millennium. Amen!

        Now if anybody that knew me and that had met me in 1958, that was my message that I was
       preaching. Of course, that was years I was out on the field running around with a lot of zeal
       without any wisdom. I was out preaching and Brother George remembers me in those days. And
       God appeared to me and talked to me like he did in the days of Noah. I heard his voice speaking
       about the wrath of God. That was years before Brother Branham ever preached the Token. And I
       saw Brother Branham’s Token message, that he preached about the Token and the wrath of God
       way back in 1962. And so, but it would come to pass and now we’re right up here, where the
       thing is ready to take place. When God’s wrath, is to be revealed from heaven.
        Now saints of God, we should never let that leave us, that we are living in a fearful terrible
       day. Everyone, we ought…we’re living in the hour when the fear of God, is gonna be restored
       back to the people of God. And we should never lose sight that don’t forget we are living in the
       hour when Gods nerves is red hot! Like a tooth that’s abscessed and you got a raw nerve there,
       that the Dentist is touching.
        So, that’s why we ought to watch what we say with our mouth. In this hour, we ought to
       watch what we think in our mind and what we say from heart more than any other hour. Cause
       
       26
       this is the hour when you must think the right thoughts and say the right thing. It’ll either mean
       wrath to you or grace and mercy and love. How many want to think right? (Amen)
        See, it’s because Hattie Wright thought right, that she received salvation of her two boys. And
       Brother Branham said this is the hour, if you could only find the right words to say, that would
       release the great grace of God to you!

       59-1123 - Speak To This Mountain
       William Marrion Branham
       Story of Haddie Wright
       57 And we was talking about building the new church up there, the tabernacle, and—and Mr.
       Wright said to me, “How’s the pledges coming on up at the Tabernacle?” I said, “Brother
       Wright, I’m not there enough to know.” And said, “You know what?” Said, “Hattie wanted to
       pluge—pledge fifty dollars towards that church, and Brother Roberson, the—the trustee of the
       church, one of them, the chairman, wouldn’t let her give it.” Said, “Because that’d take her
       about six months to dig fifty dollars out of them hills over there.” And said, “But she give twenty,
       and Brother Branham, she wants…” I thought, “You know what? I—I got twenty dollars here in
       my pocket. Meda give it to me to pick up some eggs.” I said, “I’ll just give her that twenty ’fore I
       leave back. And just… She’s away from here, and you’ll never know it. So I’d—I’d bought her
       ice boxes and things, ’cause I felt so sorry for her up there, that little old mother trying to work
       away on that hill.” And so, I thought, “I’ll just give her these—this twenty dollars, is what I’ll
       do. When I leave I’ll just slip it so she’ll get it and that’s her twenty dollars she paid in on the
       church up there.” So I thought, “I’ll just give her that.” So when I said… Something said to me,
       “But your Lord stood one day by the side of a—a wall and seen rich men putting thousands of
       dollars into a treasury. And a little widow come by and she only had three pennies, all her living.
       And now, what would you have done if you’d have stood there? You’d see that little widow put
       them three pennies in, you’d run, say, ‘Oh no, sister, don’t do that, don’t do that, because we got
       plenty in here; we don’t need that.’ But Jesus never told her not to do it. He let her go ahead and
       do it. Because He knowed He had something for her down the road (See?), little something
       better.” You see? So He just let her. God loves a cheerful giver. So I said, “Well, I will just keep
       my money in my pocket then (See?), that’s all right then; I’ll just let it go ’cause maybe the
       Lord…” 58 And we was setting there, and I said, “Now, these vision that come…” Now, listen
       close now, we’re fixing to close to something else. Now, remember, this has been less than two
       weeks ago, or just about two weeks ago. And I said, “The thing that puzzles me, Brother
       Wood…” And he was setting, like here by the side of me, still at the table, little old porch of a
       thing out there, been—had been screened in; they’d walled it in to try to make another room out
       of it. An old clapboard shingles and houses, holes all through it… And I said, “What’s bothered
       me always has been this. On those squirrels,” I said, “where… Brother Wood,” I said, “we’re
       supposed to be good squirrel hunters. I hunted since I was a little boy.” And I said, “And—and
       you’re an expert hunter.” And I said, “Since little boys we’ve hunted squirrels. Under those
       conditions, Brother Wood, where did those squirrels come from?” I said, “I can’t never figure it
       out. I was standing right there looking over the grounds, and I said, ‘There shall be a squirrel
       right there.’ And I’d been setting there for forty-five minutes. And no more than I took my finger
       down, there was a squirrel. And each time it was that way. The squirrel come from nowhere.” 59
       And I said, “The only thing I could think it to be, would be this, when God was trying to tell
       
       27
       Abraham, what—how He was going to bless him.” I said, “If this be my new ministry that’s
       coming in, something greater, that He will finally confirm in that little building…” I said, “If it
       be that, like Abraham, the thing that Abraham needed was a sacrifice instead of his son, in
       Genesis 22. And then when God held his hand from sacrificing his son, there was a ram there.
       Where did that ram come from? He was a hundred miles from civilization, three days back, a
       journey. Any man can walk twenty-five miles a day. I walked thirty and thirty-five lots of times.
       And today we travel by car and—and so forth. Them days their whole way of travel was either by
       riding a donkey or—or walking. And he was three days back, and then lifted up his eyes and saw
       the mountain far off. And besides that, he was up on top of the mountain where there was no
       water. And what would the ram be doing up there? And it’d killed by wild beasts if it’d been
       away from civilization. Where did the ram come from? That’s the reason Abraham called the
       name of the place Jehovah-jireh, the Lord will provide for Himself a sacrifice. He’s able to speak
       it into existence.” I said, “If the Lord was confirming my ministry there, to let me know that He’s
       going to help His people and let me do it,” I said, “then the same Jehovah-jireh… I was in need
       of a squirrel the same as he was in need of a ram, and I believe Jehovah-jireh placed it there by
       His same spoken Word. It wasn’t me anyhow, ’cause I didn’t know what I was saying. He said it
       Himself.” 60 And little old quiet Sister Hattie, setting back there, little dust bonnet on like the
       country women wear there. And she’d put on a little clean dress to come over to help her mother
       cook me a dinner. And she was setting with her hand like this, and she said, “That’s nothing but
       the Truth.” She said the right thing. Here’s my Bible, and as a servant of God, I say this. I could
       hardly hear the last she said. Her mother was trying to say something, but I didn’t get it. I… Just
       as she said that, she said the right thing. The Spirit of the Lord said to me, “Tell her to ask what
       she will, and you give it to her.” I—I couldn’t speak. That room, everybody, felt strange. I said,
       “Sister Hattie.” She said, “Yes, Brother Branham.” I said, “THUS SAITH THE LORD, speak
       anything that you desire; I don’t care what it is. If you want to know that God’s give this
       ministry, speak anything that you desire. THUS SAITH THE LORD, if you’ll speak it, I’ll speak it
       behind you and you’ll have it right here.” Eight people standing there looking… She said,
       “Brother Branham, what shall I say?” I said, “It’s up to you.” 61 There set her crippled sister,
       her aged father. She was poor; she could ask for—for money. She could’ve asked for anything
       she wanted to. I said, “Ask anything that’s in your heart, anything that you want to; you ask it,
       and THUS SAITH THE LORD, I’ll speak it behind you and you’ll have it.” She said, “The
       salvation of my two boys.” I said, “You have it, in the Name of the Lord.” And those two little
       modern teen-age snicklefritz boys, that had hated the very cause of Christ grabbed one another
       and begin to scream the blessings of God. The power of God struck that place. Banks fell into his
       plate. I don’t know what happened for about ten minutes. Friend, do you realize what that was? I
       have never in all my life had felt such anointing. The first time it was ever performed on a human
       being, it bypassed aristocrats, it bypassed everything else, and went to a poor little old widow
       woman living up on the hill there. And God knowed what she’d ask. Her two boys was gloriously
       saved the very minute it was spoken. If she’d have asked for ten thousand dollars, it’d have been
       given to her. If she’d have asked for her sister’s healing, it’d been given to her. Anything she
       would’ve asked, it would’ve been given to her. 62 I believe that the church of the living God is
       moving into a sphere now that’s going to shake the whole world. That’s the first time it’s been
       since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being. “Ask anything that you will, and it shall be
       given unto you, anything you desire.” Don’t you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled?
       Oh, it’s going to come to pass pretty soon. I’m looking for it to happen in this meeting. I’m
       wanting it to happen now, that that anointing will strike the whole church of the living God,
       
       28
       and she’ll rise to her feet like a mighty marching army. The sick will be healed by a word; the
       blind will see; the deaf will hear; the dead will be raised up; and the power of God will shake
       the world with the church of the living God. We’re in the process of it now. I believe it’s soon
       coming to pass. I believe it will be just exactly that way. I believe it’s going to strike the church
       of God soon, and it’s going to start a revival that’ll shake the world. I believe it. 63 The Lord
       God of heaven Who made heavens and earth, whose servant I am, and stand here now before
       you, and in the Name of Jesus Christ, those words are true. Oh, we’re near something. My
       heart’s waiting with anticipations. I can’t even rest in my hotel room. Last night I couldn’t sleep
       at all. It’s never left me; it… I couldn’t sleep on the road out here; I didn’t sleep for about two or
       three hours a night. I just can’t rest because I know that something’s fixing to happen. Our
       God’s going to move on the scene just as sure as we’re standing here. Just as sure as He said
       back yonder about the discernment in the hand and the secrets of the heart, He’s promised
       something else, and here it is already confirmed among the people. People standing there… And
       last Sunday morning in our church there at Jeffersonville, or Sunday a week it is now, when I
       told that, there stood the whole Wright family giving testimony. The blessings has never left that
       house. They said they just—it don’t seem like the same place. That little woman that never
       screamed in her life, I guess, till she—since she was a baby, you could’ve heard her for three city
       blocks screaming the praises of God. And the power of God had—we was so numb till I couldn’t
       say nothing; I had to walk out of the building. I was anointed by the power of God. He’s God. He
       lives. 64 I feel that one great thing is necessary. The Holy Spirit’s speaking to me now about, I
       believe we ought to have a night, this night that we should consecrate ourselves. Don’t you think
       so? Are you ready, church of God? Are you ready for such a move? Have you buried every sin in
       the Blood of Jesus Christ? Have you confessed all your wrongs? Oh, ministers of the Gospel, my
       precious brothers, I tell you the truth, so help me, God knows that’s true. And we’re just
       shadowing something near at hand now. I don’t know just where, when, or how, but I’m told you
       exactly the God’s truth, and God knows that’s true. The Holy Spirit’s here now, healing, healing.
       Let’s get our souls healed tonight; let’s get ourself fixed in condition. 65 I told Billy not to give
       out any prayer cards tonight. I didn’t want a prayer line. I want a consecration. I want this
       church to draw so close to God. I want it to get so close to God until when the—we might be in
       this meeting here, that that’ll break forth through this church here. I’m telling you: when that
       takes place, the coming of the Lord is at hand. The enemy with their atomic bombs is coming in
       like a flood. The Spirit of God’s rising a standard against it constantly. And just remember, just
       as I told you about—from the discernment, taking the hand, to the secrets of the heart, how them
       things is fulfilled every time, so has this happened just exactly the way it said it would be. And
       it’s just exactly with the Scriptures. As it was proved to you about knowing the secret of the
       heart, how that Jesus looked upon the multitudes, and discerned, and could tell the people that
       touched His garment, and so forth, how that that rain, latter rain, former rain and latter would
       be together, as we had yesterday. That’s exactly. 66 Don’t you fear, church of God. I know you
       got a lot of scruples among you. You’ve got a lot of up-sets, and down-sets, and everything else,
       but still you are the church of the living God; by the grace of God you are. No matter what
       you’ve done, or how you done, God forgive you of your sins; He wants a consecration. How did
       Balaam look down upon Israel and said, “They done every dirty thing that could be done.” But
       he failed to see that they was the church of the living God. There was that smitten rock and that
       brass serpent before them, an atonement laying there for them. And every one of you that’s been
       baptized with the Holy Ghost, the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin. Hallelujah.
       The Spirit of the Lord is here now. That’s in the Name of the Lord I speak. If anybody don’t
       
       29
       believe it, speak to God about your sickness and find out. Just see if it isn’t the truth.

       William Marrion Branham
       Make us sincere, knowing that we must answer at the Judgment of God, someday. And our
       attitude towards Him and His Word, now, will determine our Eternal destination.
        So, we want to make sure that our thinking is right and that are words are right. And we don’t
       want our mouth to continually sin against the flesh. We want to make sure that this is ever the
       hour for us before God to bridle our tongue. This is the hour to do it! And don’t say to the angel,
       “I was sorry, I didn’t mean to say it!” Did you know a scripture said that? See how people say,
       “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to say that” He said, when that angel comes there, “Don’t you say,
       when you say with your mouth what you shouldn’t say, don’t say you’re sorry.”
       Ecclesiastes 5:6-Reference quote:
       6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an
       error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
        The Bible said, “For by your words are you justified and by your words they’ll condemn
       you.”
       Matthew 12:37-Reference quote:
       37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
        See, that’s why we got to come to the place, before the grace of God to bridle our tongue.
       And this is a lot of times where the Lord Jesus’s precious holy spirit is grieved away from our
       congregation. Because we think the wrong thoughts, about our brother! We think the wrong
       thoughts, about our sister.
        And the angel of the Lord said to Brother Branham, “Tell those people that their thoughts in
       their minds, speak louder in heaven than their words do upon the earth!”

       107 God’s omnipresence knows what you’re doing, and even your thoughts. One time while I
       was in a vision, I was speaking to a Being standing by me; and He said back, He said, “Your
       thoughts are louder in the Heavens than your voice is on the earth.” He knows what you’re
       thinking. You might say you—you do this and you do that, and it, but, you see, down in your
       heart, if you think different, you’re—you’re doing something wrong. You should be just what
       you are, see, the—the heart. The mouth should speak what’s in the heart. See? And so we find
       that the people doesn’t realize the—the Presence of God. 108 You know, they ought to be like
       David, the man was after God’s Own heart. He said, “The Lord is always before me.” Wherever
       
       30
       he goes, he remembers God is always before him. “He is on my right hand, and I’ll not be
       moved,” because God is on his right hand. 109 Reverence! We ought to honor one another,
       respect one another, as brother, sister. And love one another, with undying love. You say, “Well,
       I just can’t.” Well, just stay here a little longer, and then you will like people, too. You’ll love
       those who doesn’t love you. That’s really a good sign of Christianity: when you can, from your
       heart, love those who does not love you. Love the unloveable. 110 Jesus said, “If you just do
       favors for those that do favors for you, well, the publicans do the same thing.” But, see, you must
       be kind to those who are unkind to you. Do good for those that would do evil to you. Always
       remember that. Keep that before you, that God is watching you. Remember, God was good to
       you when you were evil to Him. “While you were yet sinners, Christ died for you.” 111 Now we
       find out, that, these wings over Their faces was because They were in the Presence of God,
       reverent. And if a holy Seraphim has to hide His face behind special covering, the One who
       knows no sin, never sinned, but yet in the Presence of the Holy God has to hide His holy face in
       the Presence of God, what is a hypocrite going to do on that Day? What is the backslider going
       to do on that Day? What’s the ungodly going to do on that Day, when you come? And you’re
       going to have to face Him. 112 There is only one thing. You say, “But He never made me wings
       to cover my face.” But He shed the Blood of His Own Son, that you could cover your face with.
       That’s right. That’s His only covering that He has for the human race, is the Blood of Jesus
       Christ.
        Think about it when your goin around, and you’re thinking about a certain thought about your
       brother or sister that’s not pleasing to the Lord. You may as well go and say it, because its
       vibrating in a loud voice out in heaven. It’s booming right out, before the Lord and the angels in
       heaven and they hear that. Oh God, that ought to …And knowing that every time I move my
       hand the ether waves have got a picture of that. And that’s right-on Gods Television, right there I
       did that, it’s right on God’s television. My thoughts, before I came to service and yesterday.
       Every thought that I thought, is booming out in heaven.
        I believe with all my heart, like Brother Branham said, “The Bride of Jesus Christ has got to
       come to the place that every carnal thought is circumcise away from her.

       62 In order to stay with God, stay gentle. God is gentle. In order to stay with God, stay with
       love. God is love. Stay meek. Stay…Not never be self-sufficient. Always rely upon Him. Never
       use your own mind; take His thoughts. Let His thoughts be your thoughts. And take Them
       into your carnal mind, and repeat Them over. And say, “O God, take all my doubt away, and
       let my thoughts be Your thoughts.” And you sick people, do that as we’re speaking. Just take
       away, cast away the thought of sickness. Take God’s healing thoughts, let Them become your
       thought.
        That’s why we have got to come a place, to where our thinking is God’s word. That’s why I
       believe if we make our minds think upon the word of God, we’re on safe ground brother! That’s
       why I believe the apostles said to, “Meditate in your mind upon the word of God. Write upon
       your hands, upon your door post, upon your bed, upon your heart!
       
       31
       Psalms 1:2-Reference quote:
       2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

       1 Timothy 4:15-Reference quote:
       15 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
       16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt
       both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
        Speak to your children about the word of God as you walk with them along the way. “Then
       shall thy way prosper, and then shall thou have good success.” When you Meditate in the word
       of God day and night… And the Bible said that God would keep a person’s “mind in perfect
       peace.” Who is stayed upon the Lord. As long as we let our minds stay upon the Lord and upon
       his word, then we can’t let our minds get into trouble, with wandering thoughts. As I preached a
       couple of years ago.
       Isaiah 26:3-Reference quote:
       3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.
        See, the thing about it, we as soldiers today we’re not disciplined. We’re not willing to let the
       Lord God discipline our lives. We let our prayer life get soft and dody and lazy. And this is the
       age that we’re living in, Laodicea’s that are lazy lukewarm. We’re lazy lukewarm see, we want
       the blessings of God without paying the price.
        Let me tell you something! Jesus Christ paid the price and died at Calvary. But if we every
       receive what he purchased at Calvary, we’ll have to lay down our lives and die to receive it. He
       laid down his life to give it to us and we’ve got to lay down our lives to receive it. It’s a free gift,
       but it’s gonna cost you your life. It’s free but it’s gonna cost you your life. How many here this
       morning, are we willing to lay down our lives? Are we willing to pay the price to receive what
       God died for? He died that you might receive the great Baptism of the Holy Ghost. That’s why
       he died, that you might receive eternal life. And if we’re gonna receive eternal life, then we’ve
       got to die!
        This is the age and hour of overcomers. And God has let all the great opposition of all ages
       wind up here in this end time to oppose you. He’s got all the demon power to come forth today.
       And I believe as it said in the Bible, in the second chapter of Joel that the “sun refused to shine.”
       Joel 2:31-Reference quote:
       31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible
       day of the Lord come.
       Did you know, and I believe we’re living in an hour, where you can hardly see the sun shine. For
       weeks, I’ve been watching to see the sun. There’s so much haze and smog and blackness, it
       keeps the sun from coming out shining through. We have no air to breathe any more. And a lot
       
       32
       of times I think when we look out as we come into these cities and look up in the air, and we see
       all that blackness over the cities, you know. I believe it’s demon power! I believe the lid has been
       taken off of hell years ago, as Brother Branham said and the demons by the millions is coming
       forth out of hell to blacken the sun.
        I believe the headquarters of Lucifer the devil the archangel, that was once in heaven was
       once a great angel of God and was cast out of heaven, ole Lucifer called the devil. I believe that
       he has so many demons, so many multitudes of billions of demons and his headquarters is up in
       the upper atmosphere. I believe in this atmosphere that’s hanging between the sun and the earth
       up here, I believe that’s the headquarters of all the demon power. And a lot of times I think we
       think it’s smog, but I believe it’s nothing but demon power as the Bible said, “That the blackness
       would cover the sun and the sun would refuse to shine!”
        And I believe that even in an hour Brother, that back in the hour of Daniel’s day they weren’t
       as wicked as they are today. And Daniel purposed in is heart to stand and pray to hear from
       heaven. And all the demon power and all the devils withstood ole Daniel! And he couldn’t get
       his prayer through! Why? When those angels come down from heaven to answer Daniels’s
       prayer, they had to fight through all that blackness there in the heavens. Oh, brother and sister, if
       it was so in the days of Daniel how can we expect to hear from heaven, unless we are willing to
       press through all that demon power and take a hold of God’s word and God’s power in this hour.
       Daniel 10:11,12,13-Reference quote:
       11 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto
       thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me,
       I stood trembling.
       12 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to
       understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy
       words.
       13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael,
       one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
        I believe that’s a lot of times why, we cannot see the sun today! As the bible said, “The sun
       will refuse to shine. That there will be signs in the heavens and the sun would turn to darkness
       and the moon into blood. And there would be signs in the earth blood and fire and a vapor of
       smoke.
       Luke 21:25-28-Reference quote:
       25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth
       distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
       26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the
       earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
       27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your
       redemption draweth nigh.
       Acts 2:19,20-Reference quote:
       19 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire,
       and vapour of smoke:
       
       33
       20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable
       day of the Lord come:
        Did you know that we’re livin in an hour when the earth is turning to blood? There never was
       such murders and debauchery and killings! There has never been an hour when people are
       murdering one another like they are today! Until it’s not even safe to walk up the streets any
       more to get a loaf of bread. Why I believe it’s one of the signs of the end-time. When you see
       and look to the sun and you can’t see it shining no more. What a blessed thing it was to walk out
       and see a clear day. But any more you can’t see a clear day, because the sun won’t shine.
       Because of demon power and smog. Some of its smog but I believe some its demon power, that’s
       so black and so dark, that you can’t see the sun shine.
        And that’s what the devil wants, to keep us away from the sun shining of Gods Holy Spirit
       shinning in the heart. It’s them devils that keep us away from God. Jesus Christ calls us to come,
       come, come, seek ye the Lord Jesus Christ while he may be found. Strive to enter in, struggle to
       enter into the strait and narrow gate. And all them demon power that says, “Don’t pray! You
       don’t feel like praying! Don’t seek God you got to many other things to do. The Lord loves you,
       it’s all predestined, you just lay around here and he’ll come down here and seal you!” Oh, that’s
       nothing but that ole blackness that’s covering the sun, THAT’S NONE OTHER THAN BUT
       THE DEVIL!
        OH, JESUS SAID, STRIVE AND STRUGGLE TO ENTER IN AT THE STRAIT GATE.
       STRIVE TO ENTER IN! FOR ONE DAY, I’ll stand up and shut the door and many will
       STRIVE TO ENTER IN and will not be able.
       Luke 13:24,25-Reference quote:
       24 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not
       be able.
       25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand
       without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say
       unto you, I know you not whence ye are:
        OH GOD, THERE’LL COME AN HOUR…SAINTS! UPON THIS EARTH, WHEN MEN
       AND WOMEN WILL ONCE AGAIN RISE UP EARLY AND SEEK THE LORD GOD AND
       STRIVE TO ENTER INTO THE STRAIT GATE AND WILL NOT BE ABLE. What a fearful
       thing!
        Signs in the heavens and signs in the earth, blood and fire and a vapor of smoke and the sun
       can’t shine, because demon power has come up out of hell, blackness of sackcloth of hair.
       Revelation 6:12-Reference quote:
       12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the
       sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
        What is it? The devil every time when we seen a picture of the devil…
       Brother Branham said, there stand that great light over that man right over there. Can’t you
       preachers see it? And I seen preachers stick out their head out like a giraffe and still couldn’t see
       the Holy Spirit. He’d say, “There stand a black hood over that woman. Don’t you preachers see
       that?” They’d stretch their neck they couldn’t see it.
       
       34
        But brother and sister one day the camera, took the picture of the great glorious Holy Ghost
       and the camera also took a picture of the sackcloth blackness of the devil.
        And I believe the blackness power of the devil has come forth with billions and billions of
       demons streaming forth out of hell. Where the lids been taken off, until the saints look at the sun
       that it can’t even shine.
        But oh, what an hour, BUT IT’S IN THAT HOUR WHEN GOD IS EXPECTING THE
       BRIDE TO PRAY AND STRIVE AND STRUGGLE TO ENTER INTO THE GLORIOUS
       OUT POURING OF THE HOLY GHOST. Do you think the devil is gonna let us get a revival
       just sittin around soft and dody? Oh God, if we’ll ever get it, we’ll strive and struggle with sweat
       and tears. We’ll pay a price like it’s never been paid before here in Connecticut to get a revival.
       We’ll strive and struggle through this demon power and get a hold of God. GOD CAN’T DO
       NOTHING until Gods people call him on the scene. GOD IS EXPECTING US TO CALL
       JESUS CHRIST ON THE SCENE, TO BACK UP HIS WORD IN POWER AND
       AUTHORITY. It ought to be the theme of all of our preaching! It ought to be the theme of all of
       our HEARTS DESIRE, just to Jesus come and back up his Word in Power and Authority!

       The commission's given to the Church. That's what's the matter with the Church today. It
       doesn't know its position. If you knowed positionally who you was and what you are tonight,
       there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes. That's right. The thing of it is,
       you're looking off into a millennium for something to happen, when it's already here. "Now we are
       the Sons of God." Not we will be, we are right now. When? This night. Right now, this minute we're
       seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, now. Oh, if you'd only recognize that. And the
       supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer. Anything you have desire of,
       need of, only thing you have to do is ask and receive it. "Whatsoever things you desire, when
       you pray, believe you receive it, it'll be given unto you," St. Mark 11:24. And that's true.
       Whatsoever things you desire, when you pray, believe that you receive it. And you shall have it.

       Then later on when we got through the sermon and went out west, and when the Angels of the Lord
       appeared out there for the Seven Seals, and it went up into the air (which we had the picture of it
       here and around over the country), there He was standing there still wigged with that supreme
       authority. He is the Head of the church. He's Head of the Body. There's nothing like Him
       anywhere. He made all things by Himself. He made all things for Himself, without He there
       wasn't nothing made. He has all authority in heavens and earth, and everything belongs to Him.
       And in Him dwells the Fullness of the Godhead bodily. And the Word was God and made flesh
       among us, and He was the One Who revealed the entire secret of the whole plan of salvation
       that all the prophets and wise-man had spoke of. He alone was that wigged One and supreme
       authority.

       Why wigged? Why, the old English judges, the Jewish judges, used to wear a wig, they do yet in
       England; That's supreme authority; he wears a wig. And that showed Him standing there wigged
       by Angels' wings; He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the supreme Judge, and none other but
       Him. He is to look upon as Alpha and Omega. And there He was a young Man, no more thirty
       years old, wearing a wig of white, showing that He was supreme, God, "The Father hath
       committed all judgment unto the hands of the Son." Hallelujah. The revelation is never wrong.
       Speak it anyhow, no matter what it sounds like: goes right with the Word.
        Oh God! No wonder the prophet of God said, “Broad is the way that leadeth to the tribulation
       and many go in there at! But narrow is the way that leadeth to the Token and few there be that find
       it. WHY? BECAUSE IT’S SUCH A STRAIT WAY! IT’S A WAY OF PRESSURE! And the
       devils got all his demon power, until the sun can’t even shine.
        Never was there an hour, when there was such killin and murdering. Troops come in, shoot all
       them young people down there at Kent State college. Then over here the other day, the story was
       just turned around, where the colored people we’re playing hockey and this guy turned around slit
       the throats and shot down and killed and murdered right in there 28, 35, 39. What is it? Nothing
       but murders all day long, day and night. In the cities and in the country’s and everywhere. Until
       mommy and daddy can’t even go up the street and get an ice cream cone. Can’t even go and get a
       loaf of bread. Why? Because the Bible said, “Blood in the earth!” “That the sun wouldn’t even
       shine, like sack cloth and hair Never was an hour when there was riots and murders and
       debauchery’s like they are now. Why? Because the Bible said, there would be, “Blood in the
       earth!” That’s one of the signs of the end-time! That’s one of the signs of the soon coming of the
       Lord Jesus Christ, to catch his waiting Bride away. Blood and fire! Did you ever hear of spirits of
       arson’s, like there are now? Did you ever hear of an hour, of all the time burning down everything?
       They’ve burnt down whole cities. They’ve burnt up three miles two miles of California there, right
       through a certain section. They didn’t give it the publicity; afraid it would make it worse. But they
       just burnt down city blocks after city blocks, houses and business burned them down. And the
       saying among the colored folks down south, “Whitey” we want all the finery, we’ll burn your
       house down” Isn’t that the thyme of all the racial people. The blacks, “Whitey we’ll burn your
       house down, we want all the power, we’ll burn your house down.” The Bible said there would be
       fire in the earth.
        Oh God, when we see all these things that’s been said in this hour. Then the wrath of God is to
       be revealed from heaven, Paul said! This chapter in Romans will show us, why his divine wrath is
       gonna be poured out.
        Notice here, he said men in their wickedness who hinder and repress the truth.
       Romans 1:18-Reference quote:
       18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
       men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
        Now this is one of the reasons why God’s wrath is gonna be revealed from heaven. Because
       when men resist and repress the truth. They don’t want the truth of God to go forth in its power
       
       36
       and have the preeminence. God’s purpose and plan in this hour, is for the Bride of Christ

        Notice here, this is one of the things that beings down God’s wrath upon the people, is that
       they repress and hinder the truth from goin forth, see. They hold back the righteous, the word of
       God. They don’t want it to go forth and have the preeminence to do what God called it to do, see.
       This is one of the things that causes God’s wrath to come down upon the earth. This angers God!
       God angers when you touch his truth, touch his servants. And you try to hinder the plan that he
       has for the hour that’s goin forth! I don’t care if it’s religious people or who it is. Anytime that a
       child of God is walking in truth and hears the truth, and other men religious preachers or socalled Christians or mayors or whoever they are, any of those people that repress the truth from

       But when He’s found everything in its place, the Inspector, then He seals it. Dare be anybody
       open that seal until that car has reached its destination to where it’s sealed for! There it is.
       “TOUCH NOT MY ANOINTED; DO MY PROPHETS NO HARM. For I say unto you, it’d be
       better for you that a millstone was hanged at your neck, and you were drowned in the depths
       of the sea, than even to try to offend or shake a little on the least of these that’s been sealed.”
       You see what it means? 51 That’s what the Holy Spirit is. It’s your assurance. It’s your
       protection. It’s your witness. It’s your seal. It’s your sign, that, “I’m Heaven bound. Don’t care
       what the devil says! I’m Heaven bound. Why? He sealed me. He gave It to me. He sealed me
       into His Kingdom, and I’m Glory-bound! Let the winds blow, let Satan do what he wants to.
       God has done sealed me till the day of my redemption.” Amen! That’s what the Holy Ghost is.
       Oh, you should want It. I couldn’t go on without It. So much could be said there, but I’m sure
       you know what I’m speaking of.
       
        That’s why when God sent Moses down to Egypt, he said, “Go tell Pharaoh, I said let my
       people go, that they may come out here on this mountain and worship me in the spirit and in the
       truth.”
        And I don’t care if it’s your brother or sister or whether its your father, or your mother or your
       sister, or your Brother or your husband or your Aunt or your Uncle or your wife. Any time the
       truth of God is trying to get forth to the souls of Gods people to set them free from their chains
       and bondage that the devil has bound them in, and anybody that stretches forth their hand to try
       to hinder truth God is angered! God is angered! God is angered when anybody tries to hinder or
       repress the truth.
        And this is the hour when men have purposed in their heart to repress the truth, more than any
       other hour! Because this is the greatest truth that’s ever been revealed. So, men will rise up and
       repress the truth, to keep it from goin forth!
        How many times have I seen good people, that are vehement and angry when the truth is said.
       And then they begin to try to repress it and hinder souls from coming to the truth. The wrath of
       God abides upon their head, judgments at the door.
        The Bible said, “The wrath of God shall be revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and
       unrighteous men who repress and resist the truth of God. See!
        A lot of times people fight…Let look at verse 19.
       Romans 1:19-Scriture Reading;
       19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto
       them.
       Huh! Now, watch here, it said that God had shewed it unto them. God is manifested unto them,
       for God has shewed it unto them.
        Now look here! Man has an inner conscious, has a super natural inner conscious. Man has a
       soul, he’s the only creation that God put a soul in. So, therefore he has a conscious. A horse or a
       
       38
       donkey or all the animals the birds, have a life and a spirit but they don’t have a soul so therefore
       they don’t have a conscious. They are not able to choose from right and wrong.
        And don’t you never get so lopsided in your predestination that you don’t have any rights;
       you don’t have any will. Saying, “I can’t pray! I can’t pray, I can’t worship God!” Don’t you
       never think like that! Don’t you never talk like that! Because the Bible gives you a free morel
       will. You can eat a hamburger for breakfast! You can eat an egg for dinner! You can drink a
       glass of milk or a seven-up! And don’t tell me you can’t! You have a will you can think, you can
       make a decision. You can decide to marry this little blond headed girl or you can decide to marry
       this red headed girl. You can decide young lady, to marry this fat short guy or you may marry
       this big tall guy. You got to make a decision. You got a conscious, you got a will, you can do
       right or do wrong. You can pray or you cannot pray! But if you don’t pray, you’re gonna be held
       accountable for it. If you don’t read your Bible, you’ll be held accountable for it. On the day of
       judgement God will ask you, “WHY YOU DID NOT RECEIVE CHRIST? WHY DID YOU
       NOT RECEIVE HIS WORD? WHY DID YOU NOT PRAY? WHY DID YOU NOT READ
       HIS WORD OF GOD?” Don’t tell me, I saw it there.
        So, Brother and sister we have a conscience. We have an inner conscience that’s able to make
       a decision. You had to make a decision, whether or not to believe the preacher standing here this
       morning. You had to make a decision! And you fought it in your mind, you wrestled in your
       mind and all the powers of the devil come against you to try to tell you it was wrong. But when
       you seen it in God’s word and you, we’re convinced in his word, then you forsook all and
       followed after it. You made a decision. Now, you made either the right one or the wrong one.
        Now watch here. Every man and woman has a conscious, every boy and girl has a conscious
       down in their souls, see. Now notice here, this inner conscious. This inner conscious tells him the
       truth, when he hears it and see’s it manifested. Even though his mouth, will say he don’t believe
       it. He’ll fight it, he’ll make all kinds of excuses, but God has an inner conscious down in there
       that says, “THAT MAN’S RIGHT!” But in your mind, you begin to reason and make excuses for
       it! For one said, “I heard a dream, I married a wife, I bought a farm, I got oxen!” Your inner
       conscious today, they reason against it! They knew it was the truth and they reasoned and made
       excuses. But do you think they’ll escape the judgements of God? No sir!
       Luke 14:16-27-Reference quote:
       16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:
       17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are
       now ready.
       18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a
       piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
       19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have
       me excused.
       20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
       21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being
       angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither
       the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
       22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
       23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to
       come in, that my house may be filled.
       24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.
       
       39
       25 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,
       26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and
       brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
       27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
        Notice here, man’s inner conscious tells him the truth when he hears it and see’s it
       manifested, see. People fight the truth of God, with their minds and their conscious. And in their
       conscious they are condemned. And any time that you know that the preacher of God is telling
       you the truth, and in your heart and in your soul in your inner conscious is convicting you. And
       says, “That’s right! that’s right!” But in your mind your resisting, that is speaking down in there
       and you begin to make excuses, you begin to reason.

       67 There has to be a place selected. And in this, there’s a—a mutual ground, no-man’s-land, and
       they fight here at this place. They just don’t, one fight over here, and one down here, and one run
       over here. There’s a battle front where they meet and test their powers, where each army tests its
       strength against the other army, a mutual meeting place. Now, don’t (get) miss this. 68 When this
       great battle started on earth, there had to be a mutual meeting place. There had to be a place
       selected for the battle to begin, and for the battle to rage. And that battlegrounds begin in the
       human mind. There is where the battle starts. The human mind was chosen for the place of
       the battle, where it was begin, and that is because that decisions are made from the mind, the
       head. Now, they never started it from some organization. They never started it from some
       mechanical affair. The grounds never started there. Therefore, that organization can never,
       never do the work of God, because the battlegrounds, where you’ve got to meet your enemy, is
       in the mind. You’ve got to make your choice. It meets you.
       
        How many of you sitting here this morning, when you heard God’s truth in this hour you
       reasoned with it? In your mind your reasoned with it, you fought it. But in your conscious, you
       knew he was telling you, the truth! You know that you don’t have, that what he’s telling you!”
       Repent or you will never receive it. See then what you did, you made the right decision.
        Oh, how many times I’ve heard seen people sit under the revealed word of God and I know
       down in their soul that they know that’s the truth, but in their mind, they don’t want to receive
       the personality that’s pushing the truth out. But in their mind, they don’t want to receive the
       personality that’s pushing the truth out. But they’re under the judgments of God and the wrath of
       God, THAT’S REVEALED FROM HEAVEN! Against men and women who repress the truth
       and don’t want to receive it and they’re convicted in their inner conscious. Gods givin us a
       conscious, see.
        Now what did Paul say in the 19th verse here? That they have a conscious. God’s givin them a
       conscious and they know that is the truth.
        Now notice here in verse 20.
       
       40
       Roman 1:20-Ad lib Scripture Reading;
       20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world [Clear back to the creation of the
       world] are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power
       and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
        Now notice here. Now Paul who is he speaking to? He’s speaking to the Gentile world here of
       which we’re livin in the last days, under the ending of the Gentile dispensation. We’re living at
       the close of era of the Gentiles. Where the Grace of God is gonna leave the Gentiles, and go to
       another people. What a fearful thing that is friend and we’re at the door of that. Right in the door,
       at the brink of it happening.

       63-0116 - The Evening Messenger
       William Marrion Branham
       108 And the people who laughed and made fun and would not accept his message, they
       perished with the rest of the unbelievers. 109 BUT THE BELIEVERS WENT OUT AND
       ENTERED INTO THE PROMISED LAND, THEY WENT UNDER THE ANOINTED
       MESSAGE OF THE MESSENGER. IT WAS A MESSAGE OF DELIVERANCE, THAT
       GOD PROMISED HE WOULD BRING HIS PEOPLE TO A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK
       AND HONEY. And it happened, because God had already said so, and Moses come and was avindicated as the messenger of that day. Now, that brings it pretty plain to us. 110 All right,
       then we find out that Moses was correctly identified. 111 AND THEN AT THE CHANGE OF
       THE AGE, THE TIME COME FOR…BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE. THERE HAD TO
       COME A TIME THAT THIS SPOKEN MESSIAH WAS TO COME. We find out that the
       time that the people had twisted the law, made it all under a great group of something, and
       had all kinds of—of traditions of man, they had injected into it. AT THE CHANGING OF
       THE TIME CAME JESUS, ANOTHER PROPHET, GOD-PROPHET. NOW, YOU SAY,
       “HE WASN’T A PROPHET.” 112 The Bible said He was. “The Lord your God shall raise up
       a Prophet likened unto me.” HE WAS THE GOD-PROPHET, AT THE CHANGING OF
       TIME BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE, that He had spoke of for all these years. After He had
       give the law to Moses, then at the change of the time, when He said it would be done, then He
       come back to grace. And He sent a Prophet prophesying of the time. Now—now, the believers,
       He gathered them; the unbelievers perished in His day. All who believed on Him was saved;
       ALL THAT DID NOT BELIEVE HIS MESSAGE WAS LOST. 113 That’s exactly what took
       place in the days of Noah; that’s what took place in the days of Lot; that’s what took place in the
       other days, the days of Moses; that’s what taken place in the days of Jesus Christ. For they
       despised the message and perished, and those who believed the message was lost…or was
       saved. 114 Now, now, then comes the church dispensation in. We lived back in Noah’s time, the
       antediluvian; we come into the dispensation of law; then in the dispensation of grace, the
       church. And NOW THE CHURCH DISPENSATION IS ENDING. We all know that. 115 Now,
       if God did thus-and-thus in that dispensation, in those other two dispensations, He has to remain
       the same and do the same in this dispensation, ’cause He said He would do it. I’ll prove it in a
       few minutes, by the Word, that He said He would do it. Now, He cannot change His program,
       He’s God. Notice what He did in them dispensations. 116 Now we come to the church
       dispensation’s end time. That’s what I read tonight: …it shall be Light in the evening time. 117
       
       41
       We’ve had plenty of dismal time, but there shall come Light. THE SAME SON THAT CAME
       AND CHANGED THE DISPENSATION THEN, COMES AGAIN! That’s going to be from
       earth to Glory. We’ll go in that. One time we went in, the other time we went out, and this time
       we’re going up! See? All right: in, out, up. We’re coming to the end time. And we’re not only
       coming, we’ve already arrived. We are at the end time! 118 What does God find in this end
       time? God finds in this end time just exactly what He found in other end times, unbelief! He’s
       always been that, He, when He comes, He—He finds unbelief. He finds that the program that
       He laid down to the people… 119 Back there in Noah’s time, if they would a-lived after His
       ordinances, offered the sacrifices…They got away from it. When He come, He found this, that
       thing operating wrong. 120 The same thing He did when He come on earth, He found the people
       and the Pharisees, and so forth, after the law. What was they doing? Just no sincerity in it at all,
       just go ahead and slop it through any old way, and “Just as long as they joined the church,
       and that’s all they needed.” And that’s what He found. 121 And that’s what He’s found again!
       He finds the same thing, people doesn’t change. So if He sent His program and the people
       disbelieved it there and they perished, THEY BELIEVED IT AND LIVED, (NOW, ON
       THOSE TWO), IT’S GOT TO BE THE SAME ON THIS TIME. IT’S GOT TO BE THE
       SAME. No… 122 IT’S ALWAYS BEEN A FIGHT FOR THE MESSENGER TO SEPARATE
       THE OLD FROM THE NEW. IT’S ALWAYS BEEN THAT FIGHT, FOR—FOR THE
       MESSENGER COMING IN TO SEPARATE OLD FROM NEW, THOUGH ALWAYS THE
       MESSAGE MUST BE SCRIPTURAL, NOW, FOR EACH HAS FORETOLD OF THE
       OTHER TO COME. 123 Now, let’s take, for instance, Jesus. How hard it was, Him to come in
       and change the message from law to grace. Yet the Bible said it would come that way,
       “There’d come a—a Messiah, and the daily sacrifice would be taken away.” And we know it
       was prophesied through the prophets. What a great thing it was for Him to do that. But we find
       that He did it. And the one…He did it because the Scripture said, and the believers of that day
       (so-called believers) absolutely would not agree with Him. 124 Look at those Pharisees,
       Sadducees, they had their own traditions and no one’s going to shake them from it. That’s what
       they believed, their mother believed that, their daddy believed that, and their grandpa, grandma
       believed that, and “Moses said so!” BUT THE SAME MOSES THAT GIVE THE LAW WAS
       THE SAME MOSES SAID THIS GUY WOULD COME, AND THEY FAILED TO
       RECOGNIZE IT because they had got the true Word of God in traditions and had left off the
       main principle of It. And it had to be that way. 125 Notice, each one foretold the other one
       would come. Each one of the messengers, after the message, foretold it would come. Now, but
       the people always takes the message of the day that they’ve had, they set it up.
        Now notice here, Paul said, “That from the beginning of the world, man does not have any
       excuse to resist God. Even though he has not heard the revealed word of God preached, he is still
       without an excuse. There’s no atheist, there’s no statesmen, there’s no politician whether they’re
       communist or whatever he is, democracy or whatever he is. There’s no statesmen, no leader of
       man of the nations upon the earth, have any excuse for not believing in God.
        Because Paul said, even from the foundation of the world the handy work of God and his
       creation is the gospel. The gospel the good-news! That man will live after death, it’s written in
       the sun and in the moon and in the waters and in the trees and the grass and the birds and
       everything, is written of the resurrection of God. And he said, man even though they may not
       hear the gospel preached and, in the power, and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. No matter
       
       42
       where man…ever since man has been born upon the earth and is able to look up and see the sun
       rise in the morning and see the sun set at night, knows that one day their gonna die. But in the
       morning, they can resurrect again.
        And if any man look upon a little bird that will flutter his wings at day light and begin to raise
       his head to the heavens and begin to praise the Lord, in a bird language. And then see him dip
       down and take his bath in a pool of water that God has prepared and get a worm that God has
       prepared and knows…As the little Robin said to the sparrow one day. Said, “You know look at
       those people!” said the Robin to the Sparrow one morning. Said, “Look at those people, how
       nervous and fretted they are! It must be, they have no heavenly father that careth for them like he
       does for us!”
        And oh, if that ain’t the truth as Paul said, “Even from the foundation of the world, man
       knows that there is an eternal power and Godhead. They’re without excuse.” See!
        The things that can’t be seen of God, even though the word of God was not preached. Maybe
       they didn’t hear it preached. Maybe they didn’t hear Noah preach. Maybe they did not hear
       Abraham or whoever he was in their day that God was using.
        The sun that came up in the morning will condemn them on the day of judgement. The sun
       that went down at night, the Robin that fluttered upon the tree limb and went down and got a
       worm and took his bath. And when God did that and they seen those little birds, getting their
       worm and taking their bath. When they seen the sun rising in the morning and setting in the
       afternoon. God spoke to their inner conscious and said, “There is a God!” That’s what Paul’s
       saying.
        There is a God! There is no man, no atheist that ever went to the grave, that never believed
       that there wasn’t no God. There never was an atheist I said, “That ever went to the grave, that
       literally believed in his heart, that there was no God. I don’t care who said it, I will never believe,
       that there was ever a man or woman that literally truly sincerely believed in his heart, that there
       was no God. Because no man is in his right mind…Unless he’s born a lunatic. But any man or
       woman born in his right mind, that can see a little baby born the supernatural birth of God…How
       a little mother gives birth to a baby. How the animals and the birds and the trees and the little
       animals of the sea and can see Gods great creator and his great universe and his great moon that
       controls the tide, down in his conscious, God speaks to every man conscious and tells him that
       there is a God. And Gods eternal power and divinity are clearly seen from the foundation of the
       world through the handy work of His creation made by his own hands.
        And God has preached the gospel to man, ever since the sun came up. So, God said through
       the Apostle Paul, “That they’re without excuse.” “They are without excuse!” Speaking of the
       Gentiles coming up in this end-time. Paul is laying a foundation, to tell ya how the Gentiles
       world is gonna end up in a reprobate mind. God said, “They are without excuse, even though
       they don’t hear the gospel.” The gospel is preached every day by the Robin’s and the Sparrows
       and by the sun that rises and sets in the east. How many believe that? (Amen)
        Notice the humble servants of God’s prophet’s, that always went to the wilderness for their
       training. And God always trained his ole time prophets to serve training in the wilderness, by the
       birds and the bees and by the trees and the flowers and by the rain and by the sun and by the dew
       drops upon the grass.
        He explained to them the eternal power and the Godhead. I don’t believe there’s ever a
       prophet that come to the earth, that believed God was three persons! Because the creation speaks
       of one master mind.
       
       43
        And the Bible said Paul said, “Since from the foundation of the world the eternal power of
       God and his Godhead are clearly revealed, by the handy works which he maketh by his hands.”
        Notice Gods precious servant and prophet (William Branham) in this end-time Gods
       messenger in this last church age, got all of his training from the God of the universe out in his
       creation. He taught him the things of God, sitting out underneath an old tree somewhere in the
       wilderness, far away from the educational ecclesiastical systems of this world. And there through
       the birds and the bees and the oak tree and the sun in the morning and setting in the afternoon, he
       taught God’s prophet his eternal power and Godhead. Did not he say it? (Amen)
        Paul said, “They therefore are without excuse, they don’t have…there’s not a man that’ll
       come before God in the Judgement that can come up with a legitimate excuse, of why he didn’t
       believe in God.
        Oh, you find out over there in the Hottentots in Africa and all them places where civilization
       hasn’t touched, they believe in the eternal power of God and in the Godhead. They believe there
       is an eternal creature somewhere.
        Now, notice here in verse twenty-one.
       Romans 1:21-Scripture Reading;
       21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but
       became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
        Listen to this, notice here that the Gentiles even…Remember how the gospel went to
       Cornelius and how that he was a Gentile? And the Jews looked upon Cornelius as an unclean
       thing!
        (Reference-Acts 10:10) And God almighty the creator had to come to the apostle Peter that
       was sleeping upon the house top waiting for his supper to be prepared. And while he was waiting
       for his supper to be prepared, he was praying and fell into a trance, and God said arise. And Peter
       in his trance look and seen a great sheet come down out of heaven knit at four corners and up on
       it was all creeping beasts of the earth. And a voice from heaven shook ole Peter and said, “Peter
       rise and eat!” Peter said, “Not so Lord, there’s never been one unclean thing that ever went in my
       mouth or in my belly.” He said, Peter what God has cleansed calleth not common.” And it said,
       “There’ll be three men at the door, rise up and go with those men without asking one question or
       doubting.” And ole apostle Peter went up to the Gentiles, that never had the Grace of God ever
       appeared to the Gentiles for salvation. And Peter went up there to the Gentiles and found a man
       like Cornelius who had such a conscious down in his soul, that he served God with prayers and
       fasting’s with alms to God to Gods people. He built the Jews a synagogue, he give his money
       and his tithes and all of his belongings, he was giving them to the poor, giving to the Jews,
       building them a synagogue. And he was without salvation, a lost Gentile a dog! But look how
       God had spoke to his conscious. He so obeyed his conscious, Cornelius so obeyed his conscious
       that an angel appeared unto him and said, “Cornelius!” Here a Gentile, a dog! That Jesus said
       was a dog! And here an angel of God stood by him and said, “Cornelius!” Cornelius said, “Yes
       Lord!” The angel said, “Thy prayers”
        And now, you got an excuse not to pray! You poor miserable person you! Who here in this
       assembly can stand before their pastor and give him one excuse for not praying?
        When there was a Gentile, that had no hope for the grace of God, as far as he knew it! BUT
       WAS ONLY OBEYING THE CONVICTION OF HIS CONSCIOUS! Till he prayed so and
       done such alms of good works that an angel stood beside of him.
       
       44
        “Cornelius thy prayers and thy alms have come up before God, as a sweet-smelling savor a
       memorial to God! NOW THEREFORE CORNELIUS, TELL YOUR MEN TO GO DOWN TO
       JOPPA, AND I GOT A MAN DOWN THERE THAT’S GOT THE KEYS TO WHAT YOUR
       CRYIN FOR. My God! WHAT A MEMORIAL DAY! As that little Apostle Peter stood there
       with the keys to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Unlocked to Cornelius, and tell Cornelius and
       his household how to receive the great outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Because there was a
       Gentile, nothing but a dog before God obeyed his inner conscious, and was serving God with
       prayers alms and fasting’s to God.
        God if Cornelius…I pray if God LET CORNELIUS’S SPIRIT FALL UPON EVERY
       PERSON IN THIS CONGREGATION THIS MORNING. THAT WE COULD BE FULL OF
       PRAYERS AND FASTING’S CRYING TO GOD! Alms and deeds before God.
        Man is without excuse! There is no man upon the face of Gods earth has any excuse what so
       ever for not believing in eternal power and the Godhead. Think about it! What a fearful thing!
        There’s no statesmen, no educator or who-so-ever he is, has any right to make a statement
       that there is no God I see no evidence of any God. He has no excuse!

       belongs to the American Photographers Association. I have nothing to do with it, see. And there
       is for the first time in all the world’s history, a supernatural Being photographed on a
       mechanical lens. Think of it, that’s the best FBI agent there is on fingerprint and so forth, that
       researched it. The best there is in the United States; he signed his name to it. There’s a
       photostatic copy, that absolutely the light was standing there, “and is not psychology,” he said.
       The light was standing there whirling, and the light struck the negative. There you are, so the
       science can’t say today… That infidel says, “There is no God. Prove to me there is a God.” I
       can produce the scientific evidence there is a God…?… Scientifically prove it. Amen. Oh, ho—
       wha—how happy I am. If I was dying right here in this building right now, and this would be my
       last service, my testimony is true. The church knows it, millions, many millions of people around
       the world. And how they searched in and tried; and agnostics, and unbelievers, and science, and
       laws, and everything else has went through it everywhere and tried to tear it apart, and every
       time God comes right back and vindicates it in power. And then the scientific world went in to
       find it and God pictured it yonder and showed it to him. And there they are tonight and stands as
       a memorial to ring out as long as there’s a Christian civilization. There it is, hanging yonder
       now in Washington, DC. What do I say about it? I am a man. If you’ll notice in the write-up, I
       had that put in there. The picture cannot be sold without that. I am not nothing but just a man,
       
       45
       like you are; a sinner saved by grace. But it—what it is that I’m trying to tell you what is truth;
       that Jesus Christ purchased your healing every one of you at Calvary, and He’s right now
       already got your healing ready for you. It’s ready to hand to you when you’ll reach up and get it.
       Oh how simple, how wonderful! And the Angel of God Who I speak of, isn’t standing three feet
       from me now. Now, that is true, surely I couldn’t tell you nothing wrong. Surely God has
       proven to you that my words are truth. Not because I’m saying them, but because they are
       true, see. He’s near, right now. Now He is God’s messenger, I’m just His mouthpiece. I only
       say what He tells me.
        Notice here, the Apostle Paul in this 21verse here, look at what he said. Now notice here that
       Paul said, these Gentiles…Speaking of winding up to this end-time Gentile people now. Now
       watch here, He said these Gentiles, once knew God. Said they once knew God back there, back
       there when God appeared to Cornelius and begin to save the Gentiles. Is, that right? They knew
       God!
       Romans 1:21-Reference quote:
       21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but
       became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
        And the Jews thought they were an elite nation. They couldn’t believe that the grace of God
       went to the Gentiles! And Paul proved that it went to the Gentiles and Peter both. They begin to
       receive the Holy Ghost. And it said, “Surely God has proved, that God, God, God is no respecter
       of persons.” Because he don’t except any man’s person but he only excepts the person that fears
       him and does right before him.
       Acts: 10:34-Reference quote:
       34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of
       persons:
       Acts: 10:44,45-Reference quote:
       44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.
       45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter,
       because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
        Now notice here, Paul said, “That the Gentiles once knew God.”
        Now, notice that every time a man in America, England, France where ever he maybe or
       wherever he is, write down the date 1971 September the 19th 1971 Sunday morning. Every time
       they write down the date their acknowledging, the Gentiles are acknowledging that they knew
       God. Because even our time is according to the Gentiles, a Roman Calendar in the year of our
       Lord in 19 hundred and seventy-one. And America, I don’t care who the president might be, we
       got billions and billions of dollar bills. Ten-dollar bills and fifty-dollar bills and hundred-dollar
       bills and inscribed in the year of our Lord. In nineteen hundred whatever when it was printed, “In
       God We Trust”
        And Paul said, “The Gentiles who once knew God” Now listen what he said.

       pastor this morning, he’s gonna tell you the end of not wanting to retain God in your mind.
        Notice here said, that the Gentiles once how they knew God.
        Can anybody in this congregation deny that God exists? See, there’s no end…you either got
       to accept him or turn him down, there’s no middle road. You either got to accept Christ, and if
       you don’t except him, then you’re against him. You say that you love him, then if you really love
       him, accept him and live for him. Because if you don’t, he’s gonna judge you. You’re not gonna
       be judged, you’re not gonna be because you’re a sinner. You’re gonna be judged for the evil
       things that you do. You’re gonna be judged because you did not except Christ! He’s not gonna
       judge you because you did this and you did that and that. He’s gonna judge you because you
       didn’t except Christ. What will you do with the Lord Jesus?
        Notice here Paul said, “These Gentiles who once knew God, once knew God, see.” Now
       watch here! They didn’t want to retain God in their knowledge, see. They didn’t want to glorify
       God. They neither was thankful, but they became vain in their imaginations and their foolish
       heart was darkened.
        Now notice here, see. They knew God! see, the Gentiles knew God! Even though some of
       those Gentiles leaders of the governments and everything that come down since the gospel went
       to Cornelius. There was none of those governments, that had any excuse for rejecting God out of
       their mind.
        Even like the Australian government now had parliament come together and all the great
       statesman of Australia made their final judgement that there was no evidence that there was any
       God.
        Now watch here! Now, Paul said, because the Gentiles “They once knew, they once knew
       God.” But said, “They knew God!”
        Now notice here the olden days of our country…There was none of our Statesman’s…a Lot
       of our statesman that weren’t really born again Christian and really saved but they retained God
       in their knowledge. They read the Bible in their home…they read Bible in their home. They said
       prayer, out of habit over their food. They put God in their home. Is, that right? All the great
       statesman were never atheist. Our United States governments, you would never think they would
       ever elect an atheist for any office. No! They elected men that retained God in their knowledge.
       The soundest mind that they had in those days, that could make right and wrong decisions, that
       could know right from wrong and make the right decisions was men that retained God in their
       knowledge.
        But now notice here as we’re coming down to the end of the Gentile world, Statesman and
       great learned men come to the place, where once how statesman and great educators and
       everything in our country and different countries around the world, they wanted to retain God in
       their knowledge. They did not want to be an atheistic government. They wanted to be known, as
       a Christian nation. Is, that right? They wanted to retain God in their knowledge. But by and by
       something happen. That they no more retained God in their knowledge.
        Now what happen? It’s because they sympathized with God. And that’s a whole lot like some
       of us sometimes. We say that we believe this revelation, but we’re only sympathizing with it.
       We’re only sympathizing with it. But until we take the revelation of God in our lives and it
       
       47
       begins to bear fruit in our lives then we believe it! But until we can see the revelation taking hold
       in our lives and bear fruit in our lives then we’re only sympathizing with it.
        And that’s what happen with these great statesman, great educators and these Gentile ages
       we’ve gone through, they once knew God but they didn’t want to retain God in their knowledge.
       They didn’t want to retain God in their knowledge Why? Is because they are only sympathizing
       with God, they really didn’t want to serve God! They don’t really want to live for God in his
       word.

       63-0630E - Is Your Life Worthy Of The Gospel?
       William Marrion Branham
       56 When God sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a man’s door, and he deliberately turns It
       down, sometime he’s going to turn It for his last time, and then you won’t be a privileged
       character. You can set in a church and listen to the Gospel, and agree with the Gospel. You
       might do so much as say, “I know It’s right,” but never put a finger on It, to help It, yourself.
       See? You just listen to It, ’cause you say, “I believe It’s right.” That’s just sympathizing with
       It. I could say, “I believe that’s a ten thousand dollars.” That don’t mean I got it. See? I could
       say, “That’s good cold water,” but refuse to drink it. You know what I mean? And this is Eternal
       Life. And to refuse to do it, one day you’ll cross the line between judgment and mercy, and then
       you won’t be have the privilege to come and receive It.
       
        Now notice here what’s happen. They didn’t give him honor and give him glory. Listen! God
       wants us to give him honor and give him glory. We’ve got to give God all the glory! Give the
       Lord Jesus Christ all the glory and all the honor belongs to the Lord God.
       1 Timothy 1:17-Reference quote:
       17 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for
       ever and ever. Amen.
        Now watch here! Now it said they “Became vain in their imaginations” this Gentile world see.
       They begin to get vain in their imaginations.
        Now watch here children! How perfect the word of God is in prophesy for this hour. Showing
       you that people, the Gentiles then begin to turn to education. They got away from the hoeing out
       in the garden and working and tilling the land and watching the rain comin down. Thanking God,
       for the rain! Thanking God, for the cow, how good she’s givin milk. Thank the Lord God, for the
       good potato crop. Thank the Lord God, for a good corn crop. Thank the Lord God, for a healthy
       baby! Thank you, Lord, for this wonderful little girl you give mommy. Thank you, Lord for
       bringing mommy through this child birth. We got away from that. “Now, didn’t the doctor do a
       wonderful job?” “Isn’t the Scientific medicine and everything so wonderful now?” See what
       happen! Then they begin to…The Bible said, all at once the people of the Gentile world, the
       people of the Gentiles begin to all at once now they begin to get vain in their imaginations.
        Now what’s imaginations? Imaginations is reasoning. Imaginations you begin to reason.
       When you imagination, you begin to reason about God.
       
       48
        Now notice this shows you, that there is another spirit is moving in upon the Gentiles. Now
       they didn’t want to glorify God. Now they didn’t wasn’t to retain… I’m speaking of the nations
       the Gentile nations and the people. Now I’m not talking about the Bride. But these Gentiles all at
       once it begin to move upon them that no more did they want to retain God in their knowledge.
       And then when they didn’t want to live for God and be a Christian, then they begin to turn
       towards education. They begin in education their knowledge, their knowledge and education and
       their Scientific knowledge that they begin to get in their head to reason…reason against God.
       Then begin to rise up, great learned men. They begin to come on the scene, and they begin to
       prove that there was no God. Read history and see!
        All at once raised up men all over the place and come out and shocked people saying, “There
       is no God” Then we read of the Darwin theory and all these men begin to rise up and educate
       themselves and begin to hound preachers here. Back in the nineteenth century, they begin to
       hound preachers. They used to have great big debates all over the country in United States, that
       there was no God. And then what happen? The bible said, they begin to reason with God. How
       did they reason? They reasoned with the Bible, with the preachers, they begin to reason by their
       great intellectual educational powers.
        Now watch here! Watch here the danger…watch here the danger of that person that’s in the
       middle of the road. You either accept Christ or you’re against him, see. You’ve got to accept him
       or you’re against him. And then what happens, when you don’t want to except him, then watch
       the end of that product? What’s the end of the product of a person that rejects God? Watch here
       now and to a nation.
        See, then what happen? They begin to reason with their vain imagination, see. Through their
       educational system and everything, and their foolish heart was what? Got black! Their heart got
       dark, got dark! And darkness speaks of unbelief and the devil! They’re heart begin to be filled
       with devil power. Begin to get dark-black, see. Hard! It says here, don’t it? And their foolish
       heart was darkened and hardened, see. It got dark, it got hard against God. What made it hard? I
       asked you what made it hard? Education and reasoning of intellectual Powers. Reasoning with
       your mind, telling you how there couldn’t be no God! See! Educators and even the religious say,
       “Oh, the power of God that was just for the twelve apostles. And the Lord God don’t do those
       things no more” And what happen? Their foolish heart got darkened.
       Romans 1:21-Scripture Reading;
       21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but
       became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
        Then the statesman begin to rise up, no more did they believe in God. Now we got politicians
       that are atheists, all over the place they don’t believe in God. We got many statesmen that don’t
       believe in God that are atheists. Now our school systems are plagued with people, plagued with
       teachers that don’t believe in any God. And what happen? Woman, ole women up in Washington
       atheist, they listen to an atheist more than they’ll listen to a man that even retains God in his
       knowledge.
        One woman in Washington they all received it, said United States ought to take, “In God We
       Trust” off of our coins and off our currency. “Because we no longer need ole Jehovah, we got
       our great Naval power our great Air force power and great armies. We don’t need ole Jehovah
       God no more!” Right in the papers!
       
       49
        Why do they do that? How can they end up in such a state like that? Paul said because, they
       did not want to retain God in their knowledge. See, that’s what happens to people, and they set
       and hear the word of God and then they got to a…
        As Paul said, “Young people, flee youthful lusts, flee youthful lusts cling to Christ! Because
       the wages of sin is death!” If you don’t want to retain God in your knowledge, you don’t want to
       hear the preacher, you want to push God out of the way. You want to have a little fun. But’s it’s
       death! To a person that don’t want to retain God in their knowledge, they’re heart begins to get
       dark and get harden. And then no more can the spirit of God, talk to you and deal with your
       heart.
       2 Timothy 2:22-26-Reference quote;
       22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on
       the Lord out of a pure heart.
       23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
       24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,
       25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them
       repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
       26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by
       him at his will.
        Now this is what’s happen, the Gentile world begins to turn to education. And the more
       education…the more the education become the criterion…Listen children! This is the truth!
       Your livin here this morning and upon on God’s green earth, you’re gonna have to face this,
       every person, every woman, boy or girl, see. Here’s what happens when you don’t want to retain
       God in your knowledge. See, you’ll reason! They begin to reason, how the great intellectual
       educational power, education will become a criterion, see.
        Then they begin to teach the Darwin Theory in schools and in the colleges and everything.
       And what do they do? The educators and the statesman turn our children away from God, they
       don’t want to retain God in their knowledge no more. And what happens? Their foolish
       imaginations and their foolish…God said, “Your foolish reasoning’s” “Your foolish reasoning’s”
       What happened? Then their heart begins to get darkened, see.
        Now look here, at the twenty-second verse. “Professing themselves to be wise” I got a
       master’s degree, I got a Ph.D. I got a DDD, LLL, so therefore you see this, “Christianity is a
       myth, there is no God. We evolved, we just started out with a germ and from a germ it went to
       this and to that! And we evolved into all this. And there’s no creator. And we’re goin to the
       moon and we’re gonna prove it. We’re going to the Milky-way and we’re goin on up and we’re
       gonna go up and we’re gonna prove that there’s other worlds up there and people. And there is
       no God!”
       Romans 1:22-Scripture Reading;
       22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
        Can’t you see what’s happening, see? See, you say, “Why is everything like it is?” Paul is
       telling you, what’s gonna make it that way see.
        Now notice here, God said they thought they were wise but came, utter fools! They became
       utter fools.
       
       50
       Romans 1:22,23-Scripture Reading;
       22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
       23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man,
       and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
        Now notice here. And what happened? The Gentiles, “And changed the glory of the
       uncorruptible God” Now we’re bringing it down to 1971, September the nineteenth. “And
       changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
       birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.”
        Now watch here! Notice as education and Scientific knowledge…You say, “What’s that got
       to do with it, Brother Bob?” Listen, Scientific knowledge, is Lucifer himself. I’m speaking about
       Lucifer this morning. As Education, Scientific knowledge increased, as it increased… as
       education scientific knowledge increased the darker the hearts of the Gentiles gets. The darker
       they get and the harder they get, and in the less and the less, less and fewer and fewer people are
       saved. How many acknowledges that? (Amen) Now notice here, as education and Scientific
       knowledge increased the darker and the harder men’s hearts get toward God Christ and his word
       and his promise. It’s true!
        Notice here, the great prophet Daniel saw this in the spirit and Daniel said, “And they that be
       wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as
       the stars of heaven for ever and ever.”
       Daniel 12:3,4-Reference quote:
       3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to
       righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
       4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many
       shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.

       60-0925 - That Day On Calvary
       William Marrion Branham
       129 Now notice. The “greater” works, was to have the Power in the Church, not only to heal
       the sick by prayer, cast out devils by prayer, but to impart Eternal Life to believers. The Holy
       Ghost was coming, and given into the hands of the Church, to impart Life. Oh! That’s what
       Calvary meant. It took stooped, degraded men and women, and lifted them into a place, to be
       sons and daughters of God, to heal the sick and to impart Eternal Life; by giving the Holy
       Ghost to obedient believers, men who were once unbelievers, be made believers, and impart
       spiritual, Eternal Life. How much greater is it, to say…130 This sick woman laying here, I can
       pray a prayer of faith and she’ll be healed. That’s a great thing. That’s what He was doing then.
       131 “But,” said, “greater than this shall you do. I’m going to give you Power, not only to raise
       him up for a while, but to give him Eternal Life, which will be Eternal, forever.” Poor, blind,
       wretched people, how do you miss that? Don’t you see what the “greater” thing is? THAT’S
       THE GREATEST THING COULD EVER HAPPEN, WAS TO IMPART ETERNAL LIFE
       TO PEOPLE. WHAT IS ETERNAL LIFE? THE LIFE THAT HE LIVED, THE LIFE THAT
       WAS IN HIM, IMPART THAT TO OTHERs. Can a man do that? A son of God can. 132 Jesus
       
       51
       said, “Whose soever sins you remit, to them they are remitted; whose soever sin you retain, to
       them they are retained.”
        Listen to this day Daniel spoke of. “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the book, and seal the words
       of the book, till the time of the end: For many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall
       increase.” Huh! “
       Then Daniel said, and I heard and understood not. And then I said, Oh Lord
       what shall be the end of these things? And God said to Daniel, go thy way Daniel! For the words
       are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.” But he said, but in the time of the end, man is
       gonna run to and fro in automobiles and airplanes.
       Daniel 12:8,9-Scripture Reading;
       8 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these
       things?
       9 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.
       You can go to California in two hours and a half. You can fly to Germany in four hours, five

       their dope and everything. Mommy paying for it see, mommy and daddy got plenty of money.
       Everybody’s got a little sports car, running to and fro.
        And God said, “Daniel go thy way, this is not for your day!” You can’t understand this day!
       But he said, “In the end-time knowledge will increase and men will run to and fro. Knowledge
       will increase!”

       seeing now. The great drama is set, and we are ready now to see great things happen. 74 The
       Church has been brought from the cradle. That’s right. Pentecostal rocked it down yonder, a few
       years ago, back there while the people throwed stones and made fun, and laughed at, but she
       
       52
       growed to maturity now. That’s exactly right. The hour is here. Hallelujah! That’s right. That’s

       beat out there, but the hour is coming when God is throwing the blanket around us all, to draw
       us in, for the enemy is at the gate. Hallelujah! Yes, sir. He said, and now of His people, Daniel
       said, “The great things of the last days, when these things come to pass, my, the great exploits
       will the people then, the men of faith will do, in that day.” 75 And the hour has come now that
       when the great drama, picture of God set forth, of the latter rain. Joel said, “In the last days, it
       shall come to pass that I’ll pour out My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your
       daughters shall prophesy. Upon my handmaids and maidservants will I pour out of My Spirit.
       And I’ll show signs in the heaven above, and signs in the earth below, and pillars of fire, and
       vapor of smoke. It shall come to pass, before th armye great and terrible day of the Lord shall
       come, that whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved.” 76 Jesus said in
       there, “These things that I do, you shall do, and greater than this, for I go unto My Father.”
       Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Here is what He said in there, in—in the—the Word back there, said,

       organization! There is no such a thing. It’s not on the pages. That’s right. They’re all powerless
       and dead. Get it! 229 But He also prophesied there would be a real Church in that day, a little
       flock, a remnant. He said there would be, and there will be. “There will be a people who know
       their God,” said the prophet, “will do exploits in the last days.” 230 He said there would be
       evening Lights in the last day. The prophet said so! God’s true witness said so, “There would be
       evening Lights.” What is an evening Light? The same as the morning Light. The prophet said,
       “There will be a day where it wouldn’t be night or day,” a gloomy time like it is outside today,
       just enough light to see how to get around. But said, “In the evening time, it shall be Light.”
       What would it be? Roar, coming back, going back to the early time! “There would be evening
       Lights in the last day, shining.” 231 He said, “There would be a prophet rise in the last days,”
       Malachi 4, “giving the signs of the days of Lot, so forth, also prophesying for the people to
       return back, ‘Turn back to the Faith of the first pentecostal fathers! Turn back to the original!
       Turn back to the Bible! Get away from organization and denomination, and go back to the
       first! Go back to the original pentecost, to the original filling of the Holy Ghost, to the original

       489 It goes right by them, and they don’t recognize it till it’s gone. It only picks up the
       predestinated Seed that God predestinated before the foundation of the earth. The same thing
       come through in the days of Noah, same thing come through in the days of Moses, days of
       Elijah, days of the prophets, days of Jesus, on down through and to this very hour. The
       pregnated person with the Seed of God, the Word in there manifesting Itself, so surrendered to
       the will of God that the Word, and the Word alone, manifests Itself in this person, the
       prisoner, to an individual. 490 Not say, “My church…” Now, “my church” has nothing to do
       with it. 491 It’s an individual, one person! All hell is against this Teaching. All hell is against
       this Truth, but it is the Truth. 492 Jesus never said, “Now, Peter, you and John, and all the rest
       the people, YOU’VE GOT THE REVELATION, NOW THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SAVED.”
       No. 493 It was to him, personally. “I say unto thee, thee,” not to them, “to thee, thou art Peter;
       upon this rock I’ll build My Church.” And the word Peter, means “a stone.” Stone means “the
       confessed one,” or, “the separated one.” 494 Upon a certain stone, upon a certain thing; see, a
       called-out, the Church called out; upon this stone, upon this “revelation.” “Flesh and blood
       never revealed it to you. But upon this revelation, called-out group, I’ll build My Church in
       them. And all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it.” 495 “Not one hair of your
       head shall perish. You are Mine! I’ll raise you up in the last day, give unto him Eternal Life,
       and raise him up at the last days.” There it is, the revelation. Not them; but “him,” an
       individual! Not a group; an individual! All hell is against it. 496 BUT HIS MYSTERY IS
       ONLY REVEALED TO HIS BELOVED BRIDE. THAT’S THE ONLY ONE COULD SEE
       IT.

       Yeah. Amen. God, always, It’s His Word, but He always uses man to work It.
        Oh, here’s what I like! Here’s what I like, remember that wasn’t all that he told Daniel! He
       said at that time…Watch here! He said, “Go thy way Daniel! Don’t ask, don’t pray, don’t cry
       any more for me to reveal to you the words of this book! He said, it’ll not be revealed, it’s gonna
       be closed up! And sealed up until the end-time, when man knowledge and Scientific powers will
       increase. Now here’s what God could of said to Daniel! See! Maybe he didn’t write it, maybe he
       told it this way to Daniel. I’ll just make a little story out of it.
        He said, “Now Daniel honey, you’ve been cryin praying, fasting for your heavenly father to
       reveal this to you. Said, now Daniel, now son my beloved servant, this is not for your day
       Daniel! Said, now down in the end-time, see there’s gonna be airplanes, you seen them airplanes.
       You seen them cars running to and fro, you know. And said, now Daniel, I got a little Bride
       down there. And said, now this book is gonna be sealed up and you’re not supposed to
       understand it, but you’re just writing it. And said, it’s sealed up by the Holy Spirit! And it’s not
       gonna be revealed because they can read it. It’s right there what Daniel said, you can read it but
       you can’t understand it. You couldn’t understand, all these things the prophet said. And the Bible
       said, how “Blessed you are to be living in this day, that all the prophet inquired in these things,
       they sought diligently into it and couldn’t understand it.”

       thunders uttered their voices He said, “Don’t write,” what that was in the Scripture, but it’d be
       revealed in the last days. We’re at the time. We’re at Kadesh right now. 43 Here a few nights
       ago, I went into Brother Vibbert’s, over from—over at Paducah, Kentucky, crossed over into
       Evansville. Oh, Brother Bosworth was with me. And I said, that day I said… It just kept burning
       on my heart a message, that I knowed that something God had promised on the opening up of the
       power, yet I’m waiting now for Him, which I believe will appear to me visibly. I say it with
       reverence; I’ve seen Him twice. ’Course it was vision. He was standing in the air. One night I
       stood, and I even broke a straw off the field, put it in my mouth and chewed it. Looked again, I
       said, “Surely this is not vision.” I stood there in the broom sedge a looking. I’d been praying all
       night. And I looked again; I seen Him with His foot like that and His hands folded, looking
       towards the east. 44 And I walked around this way and cleared my throat. And when He looked
       around at me, raised out His arms, I fainted and didn’t come to till the next morning. And I have
       an idea what He looks like. And I’ve been feeling for the last few months that I’ll see Him again.
       Here in… PRETTY SOON THAT HE WILL REVEAL AGAIN HIS… SOMETHING THAT’S
       FIXING TO COME FORTH. Oh, brother, if I have it right, God forgive me if I’m wrong, BUT
       SEEING IT IN THE SCRIPTURE, SEEING THAT WHEN HE ROSE AND ASCENDED
       UP, HE RECEIVED A NEW MAN… NAME THAT NO ONE KNOWED ABOUT. THEN I
       SEE HIM COMING IN HIS POWER. I went over, and I said, “Don’t no one bother me today.
       Let me stay alone.”

       REVEALED, THE WHOLE THING. Now compare this with Revelation the 10th chapter, verse
       1 to 7. And we’ll see here in this Revelation, the Revelation here, 10:1 to 7, that, “In the days of
       the sounding of the seventh angel’s Message, was to finish up all the mysteries of God.” 387
       Now we find out, also, in this, that the Sixth Seal, now being open, it was for a threefold purpose.
       Now, here was the purposes.
        Now he said, “Now Daniel! Many, when the seals come off of this book, and the mysteries is
       gonna be revealed. Many shall be purified and MADE WHITE!”
        The opening of the seals released the Revealed Word Of God, where the blood of the Lord
       Jesus Christ and cleanses THE SAINTS OF GOD, THAT ARE BEING TRIED AND
       TROUBLED BY THE HOLDS OF THE DEVIL!
        In that hour when knowledge is increasing. The greatest demon power and blackness of the
       sun, in that hour when the seals come off the book. And they that know their God and understand
       their God shall do great exploits.
        And he said, “Oh Daniel, at that time the saints, many of the saints shall be tried!” Why do we
       have all this pressure today? Why is such demon power comin forth? By the billions of evil
       spirits, even like black sap, just ole like a black claw. Like Brother Branham saw that, “Black
       hood over that woman terrible blackness of demon power of the devil.” That the devil was
       cometh forth to darken the skies and the sun. Why is that here?
        Because God told Daniel in the end-time, that little Bride is made white by the revealed word
       of God, that shall be tried Daniel. The little Bride is gonna be tried and all these DEMON
       POWERS AND PRESSURES is upon the little Bride, to try her Faith! BUT THEY THAT
       KNOW THEIR GOD, IS GONNA DO GREAT EXPLOITS! Hallelujah! GREAT SIGNS AND
       WONDERS ARE PROMISED TO BREAK OUT AND THERE’LL BE GREAT
       DELIVERANCE IN THE last days among the little Bride.

       many enter in.
        Now notice here see, this is what he was telling Daniel. The Gentile world ends with
       education and knowledge at its highest. This is the sign of the end-time, when science has
       increased. Then God is justified in his divine wrath, to pour out his wrath upon that see.
        Now we see education and Scientific knowledge is of the devil! Because as knowledge
       increased, demon power increased, unbelief increased, hardness of the heart increased.
       Atheism has increased, they put God out of their knowledge. See, the United States
       Government don’t want nothing to do with God. Right!
        But notice here, as knowledge increased, God told Daniel that the opening of the seals, in
       other words. The power of the Holy Ghost would get down among the people. Why?
       Because God said, “I will restore saith the Lord! When the enemy, when education and

       Then your problem’s solved, see. And, then, He is that Holy Spirit. 69 So, seeing is not believing.
       I can prove that by the senses of the body, see, that seeing is not believing. I cannot see this
       bottle of oil. I could not see it because it’s behind me, yet I have a sense of—of feeling that tells
       me I’ve got it in my hand. See? Now, I couldn’t see it, it’s impossible. And now I cannot reach it,
       it’s impossible, and yet I believe it. This, seeing is believing; this, feeling is believing. Now I
       close my eyes, I neither could see it or feel it, but if I get it close and could smell it, I still believe
       it’s there. So, “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence,” not seen, taste, felt,
       smell, or heard. You believe it! And faith must have a resting place. And anything that’s contrary
       to the Word of God, faith in God can have no resting place unless it’s a promise of God. And
       there it takes its Eternal stand. 70 But in the face of all these un-…doubting ages and things that
       we have went through and live in today, the worst of all, in the face of all this doubt, God does
       go right on proving His Words to be right, as He has in every age. He…Unbelief doesn’t stop
       God, it doesn’t hinder Him. I don’t care how much the world unbelieves, It’s still going to
       happen. Unbelief doesn’t do nothing but condemns the unbeliever. The unbelief will send the
       unbeliever to Hell. It’ll rob him of every blessing God promised to him, but it doesn’t hinder God
       from going right on with the believer. See, unbelief doesn’t stop God, it only stops the
       unbeliever. 71 You say, “I…The sun ain’t going to shine tomorrow, I’m going to stop it.” You
       try it. See? All right, you can’t do it. God has set it in order and said it would shine, and it’s
       going to shine, that’s all, He said it would. Might be some clouds under it, but it’s still shining
       just the same. And you can’t stop God with that. He, what… 72 How does He make His Word
       known to the people? First, God knowing that there would be unbelievers…Now watch the
       wisdom of God; knowing there would be unbelievers, and how the majority would be
       unbelievers. He, by foreknowledge, predestinated a seed for every age, that would believe It.
       Now if you’ll notice in there, for, each age goes right on with His Word, everything right on
       time, nothing hinders God. He goes right on, and every click is moving just exactly right. We
       think, sometimes, it’s not going to work right. But don’t you worry, His clock is timed just
       exactly to the split instant, and everything’s working just exactly right. 73 When I look around
       sometime and see these Rickys and Rickettas that we got today, and on the streets, and how
       everything’s going on, I think, “O God!” 74 “Wait a minute,” He says, see, “My timepiece is
       turning just exactly right. I’ve got to put you upon the same basis I did the first man, them days.
       And I put you on the same basis of Luther, and on the same basis of Wesley.” Because, you see,
       sin wasn’t known then like it is now. And when we got more knowledge now than we had then,
       and when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of God raises a standard against it. See?
       And now today, we’ve got more knowledge, more understanding, so the rivers of unbelief is
       flowing in hard, but God raises a standard against it. But, remember, He’s always…The reason
       that He—He predestinated these things to happen. He foretold them by His prophets they
       would happen. And when the righteous see these things confirmed, then they know It’s right.
       Regardless of what anyone else says, they know It’s right. 75 We find out over there in—in—in, I
       believe, it’s in First Thessalonians, He said, “He has predestinated us to the adoption of
       children by Jesus Christ.” God, not saying, “I’ll choose you, and don’t choose you,” but His
       foreknowledge knowed what you would do. So by foreknowledge He can set in order, and He’s
       made everything to work for His good, and for your good.
       
       62
        So, we see that God, as Scientific powers increase. And I’m gonna close right now, in just a
       minute. As that increases as knowledges increases then the power of God has got to increase.
       Now how you think…see now Brother Branham said that, “Before this America is burnt to an
       ash heap. That Scientific power, will have to reach a greater height or as the greatest heights as it
       did when God destroyed the antediluvian world.”
        Remember they had hydrogen rockets back there in the days of Noah. They we’re very
       Scientific. And it took two thousand years to reach that height again. But you see the reason the
       Scientific powers never reached its height in the days of the Lord Jesus, because it wasn’t
       promised.
        Now if you think…Now, children let me show you something. Can you realize, just realize in
       a reality with me this morning from your heart, don’t you see that the Gentile world has never
       forgotten and have never recovered from a hundred and twenty people that got the Holy Ghost?
       And our coins our calendar and our whole system is built around, what happen on the day of
       Pentecost!
        Can’t you see why Brother Branham said, “The Gentile world would see the greatest thing
       that ever happen. There will be a great powerful short quick demonstration of the Holy Ghost,
       that will shake the Gentile world before it leaves.

       William Marrion Branham
       62 I believe that the church of the living God is moving into a sphere now that’s going to shake
       the whole world. That’s the first time it’s been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human
       being. “Ask anything that you will, and it shall be given unto you, anything you desire.” Don’t
       you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled? Oh, it’s going to come to pass pretty soon. I’m
       looking for it to happen in this meeting. I’M WANTING IT TO HAPPEN NOW, THAT THAT
       ANOINTING WILL STRIKE THE WHOLE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, AND
       SHE’LL RISE TO HER FEET LIKE A MIGHTY MARCHING ARMY. THE SICK WILL BE
       HEALED BY A WORD; THE BLIND WILL SEE; THE DEAF WILL HEAR; THE DEAD
       WILL BE RAISED UP; AND THE POWER OF GOD WILL SHAKE THE WORLD WITH
       THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. We’re in the process of it now. I believe it’s soon
       coming to pass. I believe it will be just exactly that way. I believe it’s going to strike the church
       of God soon, and it’s going to start a revival that’ll shake the world. I believe it. 63 The Lord
       God of heaven Who made heavens and earth, whose servant I am, and stand here now before
       you, and in the Name of Jesus Christ, those words are true. Oh, we’re near something. My
       heart’s waiting with anticipations. I can’t even rest in my hotel room. Last night I couldn’t sleep
       at all. It’s never left me; it… I couldn’t sleep on the road out here; I didn’t sleep for about two or
       
       63
       three hours a night. I just can’t rest because I know that something’s fixing to happen. Our
       God’s going to move on the scene just as sure as we’re standing here.

       56-0115 - The Junction Of Time
       William Marrion Branham
       9 My subject, this morning, if we should call it such, will be the message to the church, is: The
       Junction Of Time. 10 And always, in the days gone by, the dispensations has always come to
       their end, and we hit a—a junction. There is junctions on the highway. There is junctions on the
       roads that we travel in this world. There is junction on this grand old highway that we travel to
       Glory. 11 And, always, it takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence. Omnipotence is the allpowerful, and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence. And only the miraculous can
       do that. Teaching of the Word is a very fine thing, and we…it comes, “Faith comes by hearing,
       and hearing the Word,” but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotent still
       lives and reigns. WE MUST HAVE THE MIRACULOUS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE
       CHURCH IS NOW STANDING ON A THRESHOLD OF THE GREATEST VINDICATION
       OF OMNIPOTENCE THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. There has been…
        Can’t you see two thousand years, they have never recovered from a hundred and twenty
       people that received the Baptism of Holy ghost! What do you think it’s gonna be, when all this
       scientific educational powers have not even begun to reach its height? The greatest education
       they had in them days was a horse and a buggy. They had sailing ships in the days of Jesus, was
       the transportation. Is your Scientific progress, shows up in your transportation. How many say
       amen to that? (Amen) Jesus rode on a donkey. There wasn’t no airplanes goin overhead. They
       didn’t have no submarines. They didn’t have no big hydrogen bombs, great big bomb shell tanks.
       Best they had was and bows and arrows, horses, donkey’s, sailboats.
        But notice here, that the words was still bein printed upon the earth, but they we’re sealed up.
       Peter didn’t understand them, apostles didn’t understand all of them. Paul didn’t understand
       everything that he wrote.
        Listen, how great this end-time is children! Don’t let this great thing slip by us! How blessed
       are you! No wonder he said, “BLESSED ARE YOUR EARS FOR THEY HEAR AND
       BLESSED ARE YOUR EYES, ALL THE PROPHETS DESIRED to see this Revelation! Think
       about it!
        But in the end-time God has sealed up this Great Revelation and hid it in the book. Waiting
       for these great big jet planes to come on. Waiting for these men to take rockets…Think about it
       now!

       62-0527 - Questions And Answers
       William Marrion Branham
       179 So I’ve watched for something. Has it slipped by us in humility and we’ve missed it? Is it
       gone and the church is left in her sins? If that be so, then it’s later than you think. If not, then
       there’s coming one with a Message that’s straight on the Bible, and quick work will circle the
       earth. The seeds will go in newspapers, reading material, until every predestinated Seed of
       
       64
       God has heard It. None of them will come unless the Father has drawed them, and every one
       the Father has drawed will hear It and come. That’ll be, the predestinated Seed will hear the
       Word. 180 Then when that takes place, it’ll be a gathering together. And Jesus shall appear,
       and there will go the Church from all over the earth like that, with the resurrection, going up.
       181 Will it be like John came, and even the elected disciples didn’t even know it? They said,
       “Why saith the scribes that Elias must first come?” 182 He said, “He’s already come and you
       didn’t know it.” But said, “They did what they said they would do unto him.” His message was
       so quick, look, to all of Israel, and it only happened in one little pla-…two—two little spots: just
       below in Jerusalem and there, or down at Aenon where John went up to baptize, and right
       down at the river where he was baptizing, the river dried up. Just six months, and the whole
       introduction of the Messiah come right in. See? 183 Have we overlooked something? Is it later
       than we think? This is a heart-to-heart talk now. This is, just tonight, just to…Yeah, it’s just—just
       us talking here. Is it later than you think? Was that actually that Message there at the river that
       day? Has it slipped by, and the people has missed It? Is that It? Then it really is later than we
       think. When will it be? I don’t know. Might be tonight. Might be another fifty years. I don’t
       know when it’ll be, I’ll just keep on going on as I am now. Well, what is it? Am I looking for
       something?

       Do you believe that—that God in this last days has is restoring back the Church again? Do you
       believe that? Isn’t He wonderful to do it? And aren’t we happy to be alive tonight to see it? OUR
       EYES ARE BEHOLDING THINGS THAT—THAT THE PROPHETS DESIRED TO SEE
       JUST BEFORE THE SECOND COMING OF OUR LORD.
        Now notice here, as man moved out of the horse and buggy age, Scientific power come on the
       scene. After came Martin Luther come on up through there, John Wesley. John Wesley come on
       up through there down through Calvin, Knox and Finney and come down through there. And all
       at once Ford and them guys come out with the little ole T-model. Oh brother, if that wasn’t the
       most strangest thing. Brother when that T-model went down through there. The horses went wild
       when they saw that creature come down there through there. Them horses that never did buck
       never did snort, brother when they seen that monster coming down the highway, they thought it
       was the devil himself. They laid their ears back, hee-hawed and kicked and bucked throwed the
       
       65
       old man that never had throwed him before. And the ole farmers they just cursed them ole
       horseless buggies. But they didn’t realize that was the devil. That car was nothing but the devil
       product. Come on!
        Well, you say, “Let’s get rid of these devil products brother Bob!” No, No! You can’t do that
       now. We got to go right on with it. But we’re gonna get rid of them. Praise God Brother, I
       bought this ole devil product and I want to tell you something, he didn’t give me no service. I
       handed it over to my little brother and had to put ball joints in it and it only had twenty thousand
       miles. Now see! Now just think of that! There what do you do? You pay so much for them, see
       what good is it, it’s already wore out.
        Listen! That devil product keeps your nose right down to the grindstone. You got to have, you
       got to have it, don’t you? Huh! Then after you get it, what? Huh… A big ole thick payment book
       arrives, twenty-three days later. Tear one of them devil slips, tear one out of there. Boy, you got
       to get up early and grind all day long, five days a week. Sweat and worry and wring your hands
       to meet that next payment. Aw! Just thirty-six more, just thirty-four, just twenty-four now, and
       just twelve. Oh, then what happens? Then come to find out as you tear the last one out it goes,
       putt, putt, putt… What you got to go down and sign your name again! The devils got you again!
       Why I’m I not telling the truth? Oh, what a blessed thing that ole horse was, faithful, faithful ole
       horse. Hook him up to the buggy and he went in the cold, in the snow. You didn’t have to have
       no snow treads on. You didn’t have all that trouble, oil and grease and triple oil filters and all
       that. Just take him out there and throw a few ears of corn in there. What did it do? Not only pulls
       you down to get a twenty-pound bag of flower… Course you know we used to have a big barrel
       and we just put a lot of flour down in the barrel, you know so you could get it.
        Women don’t bake no more, but I know you do. But them out there you know. I seen a couple
       of women in the store, it’s real funny you know, I was watching them. Their hair all chopped off
       old, you know how we get when we get old, the flesh is all wrinkled just terrible looking there
       you know. Thiers legs all showing, looked terrible you know. And the make up all over their
       face, it just makes me sick! And there they was just talking, never shut up, blah, blah, blah, all
       the time you know. I was watching them! (Brother Lambert laughs) “You know I used to be able
       to bake this kind of cake, but I can’t make it no more.” I thought, “I know you can’t, you lazy
       thing you!” (Everyone laughs) They don’t want to bake no cake. They said, “Oh this is a good
       box cake” you know. That poor ole daddy at home there never gets anything good to eat, you
       know. It’s terrible! See!
        And oh it wasn’t so, in the olden days! They didn’t have all the automobiles and all that stuff.
       They just went out whether it was snowing or raining or sun shine, the ole horse was faithful out
       there waitin. The ole horse would knicker at you, when you give him his oats. And what he do?
       He eats his oats and the fertilizer drops down on the ground and you plant some more corn.
        Now, I went out there fishing and the fish are dying. I ate the fish and I don’t know whether if
       it’s got radar or radium or iodine, I don’t know what they call it all that stuff. They say it kills us,
       you know. I don’t know I just eat it anyway!
        They said…one guy said, “We got to eat health food!” Health food is killing you to! Read the
       paper and all the people that are eating the health food are dying.
        And the Colonel said up at the naval base said, “You foolish people, buying all those health
       foods, don’t you know all them people are just taking all your money?” All them vitamin pills
       and this kind of Vitamin C and take all that junk and it’ll kill you! God never intended to give
       you health, by taking any kind of a pill!
       
       66
        And so what happens, it’s all everything is just turned around, see. But we didn’t realize that
       ole grand pa and great grand pa, didn’t realize when the ole T- Model Ford come, putt, putt, putt,
       putt down the road, he didn’t realize it was the devil. And oh, everybody began to covet that iron
       horse! The ole horse wasn’t faithful no more to them, grouchy at him kick him around begin to
       miss treat the ole fella, we don’t need him no more. That’s the truth!
        One day, it was the proudest thing that after church they’d say, “Come over you’ve got to see,
       I’ve got the best lookin horse you’ve ever seen. Come over and see him, I finally got him!” And
       boy the proud look boy! And all the mommies with their long dresses and the daddy walk out
       there in the barn. And open the barn and there stands that great Big Stallion there. And oh boy,
       ain’t he beautiful! See! That was wonderful see! God look at this great animal, God made, see.
       See everybody retaining God in their knowledge, see. Ain’t that wonderful!
        I think one of the greatest thing ever was to see a fine rooster, something that God made. A
       great beautiful buck and a beautiful horse. He knows he’s got that power in there! You get a rope
       on him, and that young colt and put that rope on him, why he just laughs at you when you try to
       hold him. He’ll just will drag you all over the place. Oh it was just so wonderful in them days!
        And then here come a devil! Knowledge shall increase! Man…Listen, let me tell you
       something! Down in Arkansas, way down there in that ole country back there, why them people
       never did get five miles away from home! Why said down there, when the family went with a
       horse and wagon way up… When we was teenagers, way up we finally got the ole daddy was
       gonna take them on a trip way down there, to get some supplies, to a town down there way down
       there, it’s eight miles away! And when you went down there, it took so long. They said, “I didn’t
       know the world was so big!” (Brother Lambert chuckles) They we’re sincere, they didn’t know
       the world was so big, see.
        But oh, when that ole iron horse come down the road honey, what happen? It was the devil.
       And then that ole thing… knowledge begin to increase, and then the iron wheels turn into rubber
       wheels. That little tinny little motor got bigger and got bigger, got more horse power. First it was
       five horse power, then they got ten horse power, then fifty horse, hundred horses, two hundred
       horses, three hundred, four hundred horses. Now their squealing tires and burning rubber and
       running to and fro, just click, click, click. And what happen? As that ole iron horse increased and
       got more knowledge, got prettier and better. Better transportation, better transportation.
        Got kept sending more preachers on the scene with more power! (Brother Lambert claps his
       hands) Every time that…every time that automobile would get greater and when it moved out,
       then the airplanes, God sent a prophet! God sent a prophet on the scene with the power of God,
       like they had on the day of Pentecost. And now what’s happen? It’s come up now past the
       airplane and went into the astronaut age, going into the moon.
        Now, what’s happen now? Now God in these last days, the Seals are coming open from the
       book of life. And the seals are taken off and the saints of God are ready to move, into now the
       greatest anointing and the greatest power, that has ever struck the earth!
        Could you ever…Can you ever…Just think now! Now look now this is the truth, just exactly!
       Would you want to try to go to the moon beside those astronauts with your four hundred horse
       power V8 motor? It’s all right for down here, it’s all right to run to and fro down here, but honey
       it won’t take you up there!
        How many want, what it takes to put you up there? (Amen) The Bible said, “Ole Daniel in the
       last day the book will come open and my little Bride will receive that kind of power to do great
       exploits and go out of here!”

       62-1230E - Is This The Sign Of The End, Sir?
       William Marrion Branham
       358 This is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. “Nothing can be added to It or taken from
       It.” And if we put that in There, it don’t act with the rest of the Scripture. There is sixty-six Books
       of this Bible, and not one Word will contradict the other One. 359 And then, if this is the
       continuation, for the sounding of these last trumpets, or these last Seven Thunders that’s
       coming forth, the mysteries, the last Seals, It’ll have to compete, or compare, with the rest the
       Scripture. And if them first Ones in there opened with a blast of thunder, the second Ones will,
       too, that’s on the backside. Watch what happens. If the vision was Scripture, then it must be
       interpreted by the Scripture, or a continuation of the same Scripture. 360 Notice, Revelation, 3
       and 4, “Seven Thunders.” Seven Thunders, and then notice, 3 and 4, and then (what?) an oath
       from that mighty Angel, that, “Time was finished.” When these Thunders, you see, brought forth
       their voices, then the Angel… 361 Just think of it! “An Angel, clothed in a cloud, and a
       rainbow covenant over His head.” Why, you know Who that is. “Put one foot on the land, and
       on the sea, and lift up His hand and swore, that, ‘When them Seven Thunders uttered their
       voices,’ that, ‘time would be no more.’” 362 And if the ministry of the mysteries of God is
       finished, what if that is them seven mysteries coming forth? And a humble, little church like ours,
       that the Almighty has come and regarded the low estate of His people! You say, “What? I don’t
       think so.” It might not be. But what if it is? Then time has run out. Did you think it? Be serious. It
       may be later than we think. 363 These stars falling into their constellation back yonder! That
       Angel coming, and said, “As John was sent to wind up the Old Testament and to bring forth
       the introduction of Christ, a Message will wind up the loose ends and will introduce the
       Messiah just before His Coming, the Message of the last days.” 364 Notice, the mighty Angel
       swore, with an oath, that, “Time would be no more.” 365 Now, I don’t want to keep you too
       long. Just think of this, a minute now. 366 Now listen. This Angel come down from Heaven. See?
       The other, seven angels of the seven churches, was earthly messengers. But this Angel…All the
       Message is finished; the seventh angel winds up the whole thing. And this Angel comes not to
       the earth; He isn’t a man from the earth, as the messengers to the church ages; that’s
       finished. But, this Angel brings the next announcement. And an angel means a “messenger.”
       And He comes down from Heaven, clothed in that Pillar of Light, Cloud, with a rainbow over
       His head. And a rainbow is a covenant. It was Christ, “With one foot on land, and one on the
       sea, and swore, that, ‘Time will be no more.’” Where are we at, sirs? What’s all this about? I’m
       asking you. 367 The other angels was messengers, men of the earth. But this Angel…These, that
       said, “To the angel of the church of Laodicea,” “To the angel of the church of Ephesus,”
       messengers of the earth; see, men, messengers, prophets, and so forth, to the church. 368 But,
       this One didn’t come from the earth. He come down from Heaven, because the mystery is all
       finished. And when the mystery is finished, the Angel said, “Time shall be no more,” and
       Seven Thunders throwed their voices out. 369 WHAT IF IT IS SOMETHING TO LET US
       KNOW HOW TO ENTER INTO THE RAPTURING FAITH? IS IT? WILL WE RUN, LEAP
       OVER WALLS? AND IS THERE SOMETHING FIXING TO HAPPEN, AND THESE OLD,
       MARRED, VILE BODIES ARE GOING TO BE CHANGED? Can I live to see it, O Lord? Is
       it so close that I’ll see it? Is this the generation? Sirs, my brethren, what time is it? Where are we
       at?
       
       68
        For we see this transportation movin on, we seen knowledge increasing. And at the same time
       knowledge…Now look here! Look how…Oh I hope you get this! Look how the devil, has got
       his people in the spirit of the hour! (Brother Lambert knocks on pulpit) It’s a common thing now
       to go to the moon! Look how the devil has got his people into what was promised for this hour!
       Astronauts to the moon and further. And look how you and I are lagging! While the devil is
       going to the moon, and got his people in the spirit and the climax of this hour of what they’re to
       receive.
        Here we have what a ministry of God, what are they getting God’s people into? “It’s all over!
       Sit down! There’s no more manifestation of the Holy Ghost no more! It’s all over, it was all in
       Malachi 4:5, just sit down and wait.”
        But I believe somewhere on God’s earth, he’s got to have a man SOMEWHERE, THAT’S
       GETTING THE PEOPLE OF GOD INTO WHAT’S PROMISED FOR THE HOUR THEY’RE
       LIVING IN! It’s got to be! If the devils got his people in that spirit, has not God got somebody
       somewhere to get his children in the SPIRIT for what God has promised in this hour! How many
       wants in the spirit, of what God promised in the hour? (Amen) We can’t go out of here with V8
       power. We’ve got to have the greatest anointing and the greatest power, that’s ever been givin to
       the saints of God, to get into the rapture!

       63-1128E - The Token
       William Marrion Branham
       27 And now it’s already layed out. It just takes someone to come on the scene, to manifest
       those promises, faith in the—the call of God. And I know we’ve been down through a lot of
       impersonation, and so forth. Moses and Aaron run onto the same thing. But, when that comes up,
       stand still. Moses, when he met those supersensory perceptionists, he just let them go. They were
       doing exactly what he did, but he waited until the full manifestation took place. And it’s
       promised the same thing would take place in the last days. “For as Jambres and Jannes
       withstood Moses,” so will man of this day. But, now, that doesn’t stop the promise. That will
       only magnify the promise. That will make it real. 28 Now I want you to notice, tonight, what
       we’re going to speak on is: The Token. A token! 29 Now, the first, I want you to notice what—
       what the order of this is, the order of the passover. It must be a male sheep, and it must be
       tested for fourteen days. 30 What a perfect type it is of Christ, the antitype, a Male, a Lamb,
       and He was tested for three and a half years of His ministry, through critics and everything,
       the clergy of that day, but was proved to hold fast to the Father’s Word. Even in the presence of
       Satan, He said, “It is written. It is written.” Constantly He defeated the enemy, on the Word. 31
       A perfect example for us today, always defeat the enemy with the Word of God that’s written
       for the day! 32 And He said to them, “Search the Scriptures, for in Them you think you have
       Eternal Life, and They are They that testify of Me.” In other words, “If I don’t do what the
       Scripture says is supposed to be done in this day, then I’m an unbeliever. But then who can
       accuse Me of sin?” Sin is “unbelief.” He manifested every promise that God made for that day.
       He fulfilled it. He met the day because He was the Messiah, and that was the day of the Messiah.
       33 NOW WE NOTICE THAT, IN THE EVENING TIME, THE LAMB WAS KILLED,
       AFTER DINNER, IN—IN THE LATE OF THE EVENING. SAME WAY THAT THE
       LAMB WAS KILLED! 34 Now notice, the whole congregation of Israel was had to kill the
       lamb. And it was Israel who witnessed for His death and called for His Blood. We speak on that
       
       69
       tomorrow night, if the Lord possi-…if it’s possible and please the Lord, “Blood on the hands.”
       35 And notice, this blood was not mixed with anything else. It could not be mixed. IT WAS JUST
       BLOOD, ALONE, OF THAT LAMB. And it must be struck upon the lintel and the doorpost. It
       could not be mixed. 36 That’s what today, they’re trying to mix everything else with This, creeds
       and affiliations, and—and all kinds of entertainments and everything, but it won’t mix! There is
       absolutely, It will not mix with anything. The blood would not mix. 37 And it must be eaten,
       ready, dressed people ready for the journey. When this was applied, the people must be ready
       for the journey. 38 It isn’t for the unbeliever, standing outside and sympathizing with It. It’s for
       the believer that’s already under the Blood, already dressed, shod, staff in his hand, his loins
       girded, and ready for traveling.

       some day He comes forth to get this Book that He’s redeemed. And all that’s in this Book
       would be Him, for that’s the believer, the words in the Book, and the Word is Him. And all

       Book before the foundation of the world, when He was slain as a Lamb. 525 And here He is

       62-0318 - The Spoken Word Is The Original Seed
       William Marrion Branham
       262 Now, oh, man, here we are! Blessed be the Lord! Now we come to the Body to be the Bride
       of Christ, now to be His “flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.” Now, we’ll hurry up now.
       “Flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone.” Why didn’t… 263 Ask you a question. Why didn’t
       all your rains, back yonder, bring the bride to Christ? I want you to answer me that. If…His
       Coming is overdue. We believe it. (Like it was in the days of Noah, longsuffering, He’s getting
       His Bride ready.) Why didn’t these rains…Why didn’t you Pentecostals back yonder, a few years
       ago, when you started, forty, fifty years ago, why didn’t you bring Christ, the Bridegroom, to the
       bride? Going to let that soak, a minute. Why? Because you pregnated her, yourself, with your
       denomination. That’s exactly what you done. He won’t marry a whore. He’ll marry a virgin. It’s
       flat, but that’s the Truth. You know It, in a flat way. You don’t have to wonder. I don’t stumble
       around about It. Tell you the Truth. Why didn’t it bring her? Why didn’t it bring Christ, bring
       Christ to her? Because she’s not fit. He found her in adultery. 264 Exactly the reason children
       don’t live forever when they’re born; Adam found his wife pregnated. 265 That’s the reason
       Jehovah had to take a Gentile Bride; found her pregnated. 266 That’s exactly the way Christ
       has to get Him a Bride now; He’s found the so-called group pregnated. He’s going to sow His
       Seed. Somebody is going to get It, because they’re predestinated to be a Church at the end of the
       road. 267 Like Adam and Jehovah’s, He found them pregnated with man-made doctrines of
       denominations. Like God’s Truth, in Genesis 1, “Every seed has brought forth after its kind.”
       
       70
       So, when the Spirit fell on her, man had been there to her womb, and filled it with
       denominational seeds of his own thinking, so that’s why she got to be the way she is, and Christ
       could not come to her. Hum! That’s hard, isn’t it?
        Now look here! Now, let me get one more verse here. Now do you see children, in closing.
       How knowledge has increased, so has the revelation and the power of the Holy Ghost has
       increased. Now if you can see what kind of million and millions of horse powers it takes, to send
       that rocket to the moon. Then you can imagine what kind of an awesome terrible power of God
       is going be put in you and on you to take you off of the earth. Don’t you realize, it’s gonna take
       power to lift you off of the earth?
       Think about it when they say, “Zero” And they pull that switch and boy all that horse power, oh
       that just shakes the whole earth! It’s shakes everything. And so, great that those men have to
       have special helmets, special suits. They have to be strapped down, why it just pulls their flesh
       almost off of their bones and their eyes suck their eyes right out. They call it Gs’ so many forces
       of Gs. '
        Honey, I’m not talking about the blessings of God, can you realize what kind of a power it’s
       gonna take on you to move you off the earth? Don’t you realize we’re gonna move off of the
       earth? Literally with power, that will be so powerful that it’ll suck you right out of here.
        Now the ministry, now to me…The true ministry of God ought to be getting the people of
       God into what God’s promised for this hour. The devils got the Scientific world and their
       children into the spirit of the hour. Aren’t they getting the anointing? Isn’t the devil anointing
       them and getting them into what…. God, what about us? Lord, here we sit this morning
       powerless and we’re supposed to go out of here. We’ll pass the moon, pass the milky way, pass
       all of it. Just like that! (Brother Lambert snaps his fingers) Now remember, now remember God
       has got to put forth a power to combat the advances of Science.

       62-1124E - All Things
       William Marrion Branham
       They say, “Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.” That’s right. But we
       made a tradition out of it. They stink before Him. You see the reason? The worshipper coming,
       doing it, he did it only as a form. And we are guilty of doing the same thing. We make a form
       out of it, yet it’s the commandment of God. 35 Like, just recently when our movements got
       started, and God begin to adding something to them, and we went off with it, made a tradition
       out of it, and it lost its power. Instead of bringing brotherhood together, it separated
       brotherhood. You do it sometimes just for a tradition, without the sincerity of it. You’ve got to
       enter the feast of God with sincerity. No real sincerity, no real sorrow for sin… People come up
       to the altar, and many of them take a lot of music, a little dancing, clapping of hands, maybe run
       up and down the aisle, and maybe just speak with tongues. Now, I believe in speaking in tongues.
       I believe in running up and down the aisles; I believe in the clapping of hands. But if there isn’t
       some feeling behind there, if there’s some sincerity that Jesus Christ has cleansed you… Not
       doing it because Miss Jones did it, but doing it because there’s something in you pulsating, the
       sorrow for your sins, and the joy of the victory that you share in the resurrection of your
       sacrifice, the evidence of your eternal security. How can you not be sincere in that? 36 I believe
       
       71
       a man can shout and not be saved. I believe he can run and not be saved. I believe he can speak
       in tongues and not be saved. I believe he can do any of these things and not be saved. But you
       can’t class everybody that does that now. The other side says, “There’s nothing to any of it.”
       BUT THERE’S SOMEBODY SINCERE IN THAT. THERE’S SOMEBODY GOT THE
       GENUINE RESULTS, BECAUSE HE ENTERED IT SINCERELY UPON THE BASIS OF
       HIS FAITH IN THE SHED BLOOD. AND HE GOT THE RIGHT THINGS. But the other
       one’s only mocking. And there’s too much mocking going on, too much impersonation, carnal
       impersonations, carnal comparisons. 37 If you’d come seeking the Holy Spirit, and let Him, the
       faith that you’ve got in Him add to that virtue, and to that brotherly kindness (Second Peter
       1:7), until you’re built in the full stature of Christ, then the last thing is love, which God, the
       Holy Spirit, seals you to your destination. You can’t impersonate. You can impersonate it, but as
       I said last night, it’s just like a—a blackbird putting peacock feathers in his wings and saying,
       “See, I’m a peacock.” He just added them, pushed them in. If there’s something on the inside of
       him, made him push them out, he’d actually be a peacock. Certainly. But some people are trying
       to do something to look like somebody else, or impersonate somebody else, because they thought
       they did it. And you see what it does? It brings us back into a ritual and form again. IT’S THE
       BLOOD, THE LIFE THAT ELECTRIFIES AND SANCTIFIES YOUR LIFE. That’s right.
       38 Isaiah spilled it out to them and said, “God said that He’s hiding His face from your prayers.
       You’ve got your ritualistic form, yet it’s the truth. You’re doing what He told you, but you’re not
       doing it in sincerity. And you squall out day and night, but God said, ‘Your sacrifice is a stink to
       me, and I will not receive it any more. And when you pray under such conditions, I’ll hide My
       face from you.’” Oh, God. If people would think of that, it would start a Pentecost. God said,
       “Though you be correctly in the Word…” But if you don’t do it with love and sincerity, God
       said He would hide His face, and wouldn’t hear your prayers. See? That’s the way. 39 Oh, you
       said that “You’re taking under the Old Testament, Brother Branham.” All right. Let’s take the
       New Testament, Second Timothy 3. THE HOLY SPIRIT WARNED US THAT IN THE LAST
       DAYS THAT THE CHURCH WOULD GET AWAY FROM THE SINCERITY AND THE
       FAITH. THEY’D HAVE A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT WOULD DENY THE POWER
       THAT WENT WITH THE RIGHT THING, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT
       DENYING THE POWER THEREOF. YES, SIR. GOD HATES A POWERLESS RELIGION.
       AND ANY RELIGION TODAY THAT HASN’T GOT CHRIST IN IT, IS POWERLESS. BUT
       ANY RELIGION THAT CHRIST IN IS UNDER HIS OWN BLOOD, AND IT’S GOT
       POWER IN IT. You say God hates a religion without power? He said, “Your solemn feasts is
       a stink.” I guess He does hate it. He said, “It—it makes Me sick.” And remember, He told this
       rich Laodicean church that “Because you’re lukewarm (in other words, you make Me sick),
       I’ll spue you out of My mouth.” And we’ve come to that age. God, send us an Isaiah to chop
       the thing to pieces, lay it out before the people: cry out; spare not. You think he’d be accepted?
       Certainly not. But he’d cry just the same. Solemn feasts, they’re a stink. God hates powerless
       religion. It’s got to have power in it. It’s got to have sincerity. Sincerity brings power. Sincerity
       brings real worship, not forms, but genuine power worship to know that you’ve passed from
       death unto Life. 40 God wants to perform His Word by His power. And when the church
       denies His power, how can He perform and vindicate His Word? When the church explains it
       away and says it’s for some other day, and something, how can God, Who wants to—to fulfill His
       Word, and perform His Word among the people… And the people deny that He does it. Yet, they
       go through all the rituals. See? Here’s what’s happened. God wants to perform by the Holy
       Ghost, and vindicate His Word; and the church wants to perform. They have to deny the Holy
       
       72
       Ghost. They want to perform to make a big organization, and what else? To bring membership,
       no matter what you have to baptize sinners, drunkards, bootleggers, anything else, and take them
       into the body of the church. No wonder Revelation 17 said this old prostitute woman, that had a
       bunch of daughters, that she was full of names, or blasphemous names. Churches, or daughtercalling the names of her daughters… People who join churches and call that “got salvation,”
       it’s a blasphemy. Now, I know the King James here said, “names of blasphemy,” but you look
       in the Diaglott, and see if it is. It says, “Blasphemous names.” There’s quite a difference. She
       is full of those. She’s got nine hundred and something different organizations in her, plenty of
       blasphemous names. Got away, by some man-made tradition got away from the true worship,
       power out of the… 41 Oh, you say, “I went down there, and there’s a lot of power. Brother,
       the whole floor was dancing in the Spirit,” AND NOT ENOUGH FAITH TO HEAL A
       TOOTHACHE. YOU CALL THAT POWER? THAT’S NOT POWER. THAT’S BLESSINGS.
       THERE’S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLESSINGS AND POWER. God makes
       His blessings upon the righteous and unrighteous. The sun shines and… See? WE GOT TO GET
       BACK TO TRUTH, FRIENDS. WE GOT TO COME BACK TO WHAT GOD MEANS. What
       He says, He means. See? And He refused their… Once hid His face from their prayers…
        Now watch here! Do you remember Brother Branham’s vision and all those men’s visions, of
       how they seen this great chief upon this white horse? And how that he had such, speaking with
       such voice of authority. That it was such a forceful voice of authority, that the scientists was
       down there by that highway he was on running from east to the west. And they was pouring
       them chemicals in there. And when he squalled out with a loud forceful Voice and the horse
       reared up in the air and was pawing like that and that voice shook the earth. And even made the
       scientist look up and stop what they were doing. But then they went right back to it. Showing
       that, it’ll get their attention but they’ll go on in their worldly way and miss it.

       them up, put them back in the sack.” Said, “Some of them rolled out, and rolled down, so I went
       to try to get them, and under…on the grass.” And said, “They rolled under one of these chainlock fences. And there was a big super highway run in there. I looked back east, and,” he said,
       “the—the—the chain was hooked against a—a big rock back in the east. And I went back

       “Brother Branham, it was your voice,” said, “I knowed; there was something said that.” Said—
       said, “It said, ‘I’ll ride this trail once more!’” 260 And said, “I started looking up the rock, like
       this, and looked on, in a past the clouds. And way up there, standing on a rock that reached
       
       73
       from the east to the west, in a pointed shape like that, like a pyramid, run back here to the east,
       and,” said, “there you were standing there, on a horse that I never seen anything like it in my

       chief, with all the things the Indians use.” Said, “He had a breastplate; them bangles on the
       arms, and all down around like that.” Said, “You had your hands up like that.” And said,
       “That horse standing there like a military horse, with a prance like this, walking,” me standing
       still. And said, “You pulled on the reins, went riding off towards the west.” 261 Said, “I looked
       down there, and there was a whole lot of scientists.” And the next morning…That was Saturday.
       On the next morning, I preached on scientists, you know, being of the devil. And said, “Scientists
       there were pouring things in tubes, and mixing it.” Said, “You stopped the horse, raised up your
       hands again and screamed, ‘I’ll ride this trail once more!’” And said, “The whole earth shook.
       Them people shook,” said, “looked up and looked at one another, like that, and looked up to
       you. They just shrugged their shoulders, went on with their scientific research.” And said, “You
       started going on towards the west. 262 “And when it did,” said, “I seen this man that called
       himself a prophet, you know,” said, “he come up on a horse that was mixed with white and black
       together.” And said, “He got up behind this great big horse.” Said, “It was,” said, “way up
       above the clouds, and the road wasn’t over about that wide.” And said, “That horse just danced,
       to the wind blowing the feathers and everything on—on your garb,” and said, “then the horse
       mane and tail blowing. Great master, big white horse, walking right in line.” And said—and
       said, “This guy ran up behind you, come from towards Canada,” and the man lives in Canada.
       And he said, “Come back, and,” said, “he took his little horse, trying to knock your big horse
       off; turning him around; make his hips hit against the…” Said, “It never moved the big horse; he
       just kept walking.” 263 Said, “Then, all of a sudden,” said, “you turned around.” Said, “That
       would be the third time you had spoke, but the second time you said ‘I’ll ride.’” And said, “You
       didn’t speak like you did. You commanded.” Said, “You turned around and called the man by
       name, and said, ‘Get off of here! You know that no man can ride this road here without God
       be ordaining him to do it. Get off of here!’” 264 And said, “The man turned around.” And said,
       “The man has wrote me letters.” And said, “Across his horse’s hips,” that black and gray, and
       mixed up together, said, “across his horse’s hips was wrote his name, signature just exactly like
       is on his letter. And he rode off towards the north.” 265 Said, “Then you went on down; that big
       horse turned around, way as far west as you could.” Said, “You stood and raised your hands up
       like that.” Then he started crying. Said, “Brother Branham, to see that horse standing there; all
       that war bonnet and everything like that, and,” said, “that breastplate and everything shine.”
       Said, “You held your hands up a little while.” And said, “You looked down again, picked up the
       reins, said, ‘I’ll ride this trail just once more!’” Said, “The whole earth shook back and forth,
       like that.” And said, “There was no more life left in me; I just fell down aside of the rock. Then I
       woke up.” Said, “What does it mean, sir?” I said, “I don’t know.”
        (Brother Lambert is knocking on pulpit) Now brothers and sisters can you imagine, what kind
       of a message, what kind of an awesome power that will make such Scientific progress that
       transplants hearts that are creating a life. And said, in a few more years they’ll be able to make a
       human. They are taking the semen of man freezing it in banks and are gonna produce a super
       race. A great Senator is trying to give the colored people so many thousands of dollars if they’ll
       come in the men, to perform an operation so they can’t produce any children, so they can get rid
       of their kind.

        Don’t you realize…Brother Klammer can probably tell us even more, even more than I know
       about it. The doctor and Hitler. Don’t you realize what Hitler tried to do? Take those great SS
       troops, the strongest most intellectual Germans they had and breed them. They had all kinds of
       women in these nice apartments and everything to live with these SS troops and to get pregnant.
       And Hitler was gonna produce a super race. Don’t you realize that’s the devil! DON’T YOU
       REALIZE THAT THE DEVIL WANTS TO PRODUCE A SUPER RACE! WHY? BECAUSE
       HE KNOWS THAT GODS GONNA HAVE A SUPER RACE! A HOLY GHOST FILLED
       CHRISTIAN! Doing great signs and wonders and miracles. Trying to mock God!

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       
       Here is what I am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth
       after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let the earth bring forth
       grass, and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
       itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and
       thence into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the
       church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. IN THESE
       LAST DAYS THE TRUE BRIDE CHURCH (CHRIST’S SEED) WILL COME TO THE
       HEADSTONE, AND SHE WILL BE THE SUPER CHURCH, A SUPER RACE, AS SHE
       NEARS HIM. They in the bride will be so much like Him that they will even be in His very
       image. This is in order to be united with Him. They will be one. They will be the very
       manifestation of the Word of the living God. Denominations cannot produce this (wrong seed).
       They will produce their creeds and their dogmas, mixed with the Word. This mongrelizing brings
       forth a hybrid product.

       super race… Oh, yes. Not what you call a super race, but what God calls super race…
       Because they got what? Supernatural power, with supernatural signs, through a supernatural
       belief in a supernatural Word, from a supernatural God. Amen. You talk about super. Whew.
       Supernatural God in a supernatural body in a natural people, giving supernatural signs…
       Hallelujah. Yes. A super race… They that know their God shall do exploits, great exploits, and
       show supernatural signs: A PEOPLE, ABRAHAM'S SEED, A SIGN OF THE

        Oh, brother and sister, to think of the hour that we’re livin in! And here we’re right up there!
       When the ministry ought to be having us in the spirit of the hour, that we’re supposed to have.
       And what are they doing? Saying, “It’s all over!”
        Now watch it! And I predict this and I don’t say that he will. If the Lord tarries to 1973, you
       just watch and see what happens? If God hasn’t got a ministry reserved…doesn’t have a ministry
       reserved and a people reserved to receive his coming the whole message would end! Just wait for
       they all got their hopes that the rapture is gotta take place by 1973, and it don’t. I hope it does, I
       pray that it does. But I say one thing, I’ve purposed in my heart like Daniel to stand if it’s 1973
       or 1977 I’m gonna be right here waiting for his coming and watching and waiting!
        Brother let me tell you something! That was just a… When the seals were opened, it was just
       two or three seconds with God. God don’t get weary. And neither should we get weary. He said,
       he’d be here and he didn’t say it would be 1973 or when it’ll be, I don’t know. But I believe
       we’ll know and I’m willing to wait!
        But I tell you one thing! People that don’t have a revelation… And right now, they’re getting
       weary. The preachers have got numbers and put them together. I know personal friends of mine,
       has got numbers and “It’s gonna be in six months and this and that, this and that.” They don’t
       have nothing to preach no more and they’re weary and going ahead and cutting the services
       down and some across the country is only meeting one day a week now. And trying to figure
       what they’re gonna do with that one.
        Let me tell you something! If that devil press up against me, we’ll have service seven days a
       week! The bible said, “Don’t forsake the assembling of yourself together as the unbelievers are.
       But even gather yourself even more so, as you see that day approaching.”
       Hebrews 10:25-Reference quote:
       25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting
       one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
       Now the devil trying to get them, to forsake of gathering themselves together. If we don’t come
       here and do nothing but raise our hands and praise God for the outpouring, we’ll do it. How
       many believe we ought to buff right up against the devil? (Amen) Sure! That’s what they’re
       doing, their dying down. Brother Bob Gatlian said, “It’s just as dead brother” Brother Mike
       (Canada) said down in Georgia said, “The services are just as dead and people don’t know what
       to preach and they don’t know what to say. It’s awful!”
        And in that hour Jesus said…Jesus said it would be that way but, “Don’t forsake the
       assembling of yourself” Why? Why? Why? He don’t want you over home staying home and this
       
       76
       one over there. Why? Because he knows that he promised, that he’s gonna pour out his spirit
       when your gathered together. That’s why you gather together, that’s the initiative to keep you
       coming, to keep you pressing and striving! Is for all of us together are going to receive an
       outpouring of the Holy Ghost!
        Now what is it? Now the moves on for the devil across the country to get them all to…Watch
       the tape meetings see. First, they started out we’re having them all the time. So, enthused about
       it. And oh, they we’re having conventions all over the country, here and there, here and there
       everywhere. Now what happened? Oh, letters was coming in every week, why there was so
       many you couldn’t go to them.
        And oh, the Spoken-Word brothers were going all over Africa and everything. Went to Africa
       and come back before the sun went down. Oh, they we’re gonna stay 30 months and preach this
       message to the heathens. I said, “They won’t stay a week.” Down in my heart, I said they won’t
       stay a week. They was back before the week was out. Can’t even get them to go again.
        Oh brother, what an hour for the little Bride, to stand this pressure and all this demon power.
       Rise and shine brother. What an hour that we can rise and shine and prove to God that we’re
       believers and love his word and to be watching and waiting for his great coming.
        Now, let me close here.
        Now we see how this great knowledge comes, great knowledge increases. God has got to
       raise up a standard against it. He’s got a message and he’s got the Dynamics and the power of
       God to go with that message. And we will see as Brother Branham said, “Something happen in
       the Gentile world that would shake it, before the rapture takes place.” And I believe it’s
       something…it’s something that we know right here what it’s gonna be, it’s an outpouring of the
       Holy Ghost is gonna shake the Gentile world.

       FULNESS AND POWERS AND SIGNS AND WONDERS. The reason I hold…the Pentecost
       has been pushed out on the corner and went wild on different things like that, the time wasn’t
       ripe yet. That’s the reason they’ve had all this fanaticism. But that’s God’s Divine promise and
       God’s Divine Word, and It has to come to pass for God’s done said so. And I believe just before

       JUST BEFORE THE COMING OF THE LORD JESUS, TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN
       THAT’S GOING TO SHAKE THE GENTILE WORLD BEFORE GOD LEAVES IT. Yes. I’m
       expecting it in Phoenix. I’m looking for it. I want you to agree with me and expect it.
       
       
       77
        Now, God is absolutely positively got to give the saints that’s upon earth that Daniel saw
       when the seals we’re opened…He’s got to give those saints, a pouring out of God’s spirit and
       revelation to cause to break the yoke of unbelief and the power of the devil. See! He’s got to do
       it, he got to raise that kind of a standard.
        Now you watch transportation, you can see what kind of standard he’s gonna raise. You can
       measure it by transportation.
        Now notice here! Maybe we can get one more verse. Say verse twenty-three. Now watch this
       Gentile world now!
       And they changed the glory of God…Now I read that! “The fourfooted beasts and creeping
       things.”
       Romans 1:23-Reference quote:
       23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man,
       and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
        Now notice here! See! What’s that “Creeping things”? Images, yea see! They’ve taken out the
       power of God and just making a form of religion. Hanging up a little Mary, a little Statute of
       Peter, a little Paul little images. All kinds of a…Making God like a some…Bringing him down to
       the earth like some creeping thing. See! Serving some kind of image, a historical God! Taking
       out the power of God, the power of his eternal Godhead. See!
        Now watch here!
       Romans 1:24-Scripture Reading;
       24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to
       dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
        Now that’s verse twenty-four. Now look here! Look at this very prophesy taking place, right
       in your neighborhood, right in your newspapers, right in your state where you’re living in right
       now and where ever you come from. God because of these people, as I said in the other verses.
       Not wanting to retain God in their knowledge, not wanting to serve God, and letting education be
       the criterion of the hour. To eat, drink and be merry! God is an ole historical God, he won’t judge
       you, he won’t burn you. There’s no hell! Let me tell you something! There is a literal lake of
       fire! There is a judgement to come and every man will stand before the judgement seat of Christ
       and give account for the deeds he’s done in this body whether it be good or bad. Is, that right?
       (Amen)
        Now notice here, because this Gentile world and these kingdoms of this last world, they
       didn’t want to retain God in their knowledge and didn’t want to serve God. God gave them over
       to vile affections and uncleanness. Their foolish heart was darkened by their imaginations.
        And what’s happen? God gives up on the Gentiles, he gives up on them. He gives up on
       them! And then his heart and his spirit no longer strives with their hearts.
        Now look what happens to the Gentiles, this last generation. Speaking of the younger people!
       Now watch this last generation here, see what happens. Wherefore God… this is the results, are
       generation, my children your children daddy, my children, our teenagers, this last generation, see
       that we’re living in right now. Daddy, me and my generation, this last generation. Of course, my
       children will never bring forth another generation. It’s got to end here! They may bring forth
       children, I’m not saying my children won’t get married. But this Lord Jesus will come back to
       
       78
       earth, before my generation passes away. Now notice here! It’s got to! We see God is gonna
       keep his word.
        Now notice here, this generation of Gentiles didn’t want to retain God in their knowledge and
       they give birth to children. Now here’s the product that come out with.
       Romans 1:24-Scripture Ad Lib Reading
       24 Wherefore God also [This is the end before it is. Burnt] gave them up to uncleanness through
       the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
        What is he saying? This generation of Gentiles will be given over to sexual impurities. Satan
       the God of sex, that started sex out, will be the God that they’re worshiping in the end-time.
       Even listen! Satan started it off with sex and he’s gonna end it up with sex. And he started out
       with sex and he’s gonna end up not with a natural legitimate sex but a perverted sex.
        Sex… Paul said that the Gentiles would end up in sexual impurities. Listen to this! God said
       through Paul here said, “These Gentile people will end up in sexual impurities and they will get
       so bad that they will dishonor their bodies between one another.”
        Now you know when people retain God in their knowledge, that men honor and respect the
       body of the woman. Respect how she was made and what she was made for. In those days, they
       retain God in their knowledge. They would take off their hat to a woman, step aside and open the
       door for her. Now it’s an unheard-of thing! No longer does this generation respect the woman
       any more. And to show you that, the woman is striving for the same equal rights as the man.
       Showing you that we are living in the time of the perversion of the natural course of life through
       sex.
        Now I believe in sex education. But I don’t want to believe it, like their putting it out. So, I’d
       rather teach you the truth about sex. And I’ve never been one to even want to mention the
       subject. But I find that as a faithful pastor in this hour, I’m gonna have to keep you posted on the
       truth of sex.
        Now let me tell you something! Now the Bible said, marriage is honorable in all and the bed
       is undefiled. But fornicators and whoremongers will God judge.
       Hebrews 13:4-Reference quote:
       4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God
       will judge.
        And sexual impurities is one of the biggest things to bring down, the wrath of God and the
       judgements of God upon you as an individual, upon your family and upon your church and upon
       your nation. How many say amen to that? (Amen)
        Now notice here! Paul said that the Gentiles will end up in sexual impurities and it’ll be so
       bad, that the men will not honor the woman’s body any longer.
        Now watch this! Why? Is because not wanting to retain God in their knowledge. And what?
       God would give them up to uncleanness through the own lusts of their heart. Now what they do?
       They don’t want to serve God, they want to eat, drink and be merry, have their own rights, do
       what they want to do. They don’t want to fear God no more. See, if they want to kill a man, kill
       him. If they wanna go out and take this woman and live with her, they’ll take her. See!
       
       79
        And let me say it! The biggest…What broke more little girl’s virginity than anything, that I
       know of was the whore houses automobiles. You know I’m telling you the truth. Little sissy, out
       parked under the oak tree in a big 88 Oldsmobile all loved up with little buddy so and so. See!
        Like Brother Branham said, “You talk about that ole Kentucky mama that makes that girl sit
       out on the porch with another person that’s married older than her or some older friend. Yeah,
       but when the boy married her, he found her to be a virgin. Not so now!
        Now brother a ministry is duly obligated by the word of God to marry a virgin. Now where
       can a minister hardly find a virgin, unless he finds a sainted girl that’s been raised up in a sainted
       home.
        Cause why? No more are the women’s body honorable any more. And that’s one of the most
       dishonorable things that ever was, that when a girl breaks her virginity, she is ruined and her
       field is polluted. And God said that a man that would go marry a woman that’s already
       committed adultery and fornication, and he has the right to put her away and marry another.
       Because her field is not clean. See! It’s a moral spiritual, natural moral and spiritual obligation to
       God, for a girl to keep her virginity.
        Now here we have the freedom of sex today. Now you can open the car door, in
       Sweden…God will sink that place, God will sink that nasty dirty filthy place. Where you go
       down the street now in Finland and watch sexual relations through men and women right on the
       news right in public anywhere. God, God will burn that dirty nasty thing, it’s not fit to stand
       overnight. And America is getting just as bad!
        I look in the newspaper and see our great Statesman… woman that’s has got three and four
       children going to them great parties and the women’s dresses split down through there. What is
       it? They’re just as unclean nasty filthy dirty spiritually nothing but whores, I don’t care what
       they say. Don’t they know that their corrupting our whole nation and sending them to hell as fast
       as they can go.
        And them poor boys over there are dying over there are dying like flies. OH, GOD! WHY, IT
       OUGHT TO BLEED OUR HEARTS men and women to see such vileness! You know, it’s so
       vile and wicked today that we’re getting used to it. When men in this congregation we ought to
       shutter at the sight of a women goin down the street with no clothes on. God have mercy upon us
       children.
        God send the Holy Ghost upon us with such a powerful anointing Holy Ghost conviction, that
       we can’t stand these things that’s going on. You know what, these things is supposed to cause
       you and I to pray and strive and cry night and day for the Lord to come. Instead, he’s just rocking
       us into a coma and just excepting it, as the thing of the hour. Ya it’s goin to be, but brother our
       voices have got to be on record, crying out against it.
        Now notice here, see their giving their self over to vile affections and lust of their own body.
       Dishonoring their body between themselves, see. Now what is it?
        Now you notice all the hippies today, they don’t want a two-seated car. They want a station
       wagon. You can’t sell them a two-seated car now, they want a station wagon. Because they got
       their little prostitute house and their little prostitute running right along down the road with them
       all the time.
        Oh, the wickedness and the vileness, God how that’s coming up before God. AND IT’S
       HEAPING UP TO THE GREATEST JUDGMENT THAT’S EVER BEEN on the face of the
       earth. When the wrath of God will be revealed from heaven, with fiery vengeance of earth
       quakes and all kinds of terrible plagues and everything. We’re gonna pay for it!
       
       80
       But thank God the little Bride ain’t, cause she’s gonna leave here. I’m thankful to God we got a
       way out.
        Now notice here, see what happen they changed the truth of God. Verse 25. Into a lie and
       worshipped and served the creature more than the creator, see. Serving the creatures more than
       the creator.
       Romans 1:25-Scripture Reading;
       25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than
       the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
        For this cause…Verse 26. In closing.
       Romans 1:26-Scripture Reading;
       26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the
       natural use into that which is against nature:
        Now honey, can you give me just five minutes and let me finish this up? (Amen) I’ll probably
       never preach this again.
        Now notice here. That the young people are not marrying any more. Now anytime… now
       young girls let this be a lesson for you. I don’t care what that long haired curly fella, cute little
       thing, tells you. Once he uses your body, then he’s through with you. He’ll not want to marry
       you. He’ll not want to marry you at all. He’ll lie to you; I don’t care what he says. Once he has
       his way with your body, then your nothing, you broke down your morals and you got no
       character and your gone, see.
        Now what happens? Now in this hour the last Gentile people they come to a place where
       there’s nothing but sex, eat and drink and make merry. Push God out of their knowledge, they
       didn’t want God, just rock and roll rip and tear and have a big time. They’re gonna pay for it.
        The wages of sin is death! You’re gonna get paid off for it. Remember that message I
       preached on pay-day? You are gonna get the check for all of it, for every generation. These
       teenagers today, this generation is gonna receive a check for all the wickedness.
       Romans 6:23-Reference quote:
       23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
       Lord.
        Now what’s happen? There never was an hour in the history of the Gentile world, where the
       young people we’re givin over… And the last generation… Mommy and daddy got Suzie over to
       watch the baby watch television and eat hot dogs and soda crackers or whatever it is. And
       mommy and daddy out running out with one another, swapping husbands and wives. And little
       Lucy whatever her name is, finds out about it mommy and daddy arguing four o'clock in the
       morning. Don’t tell me, I listen sometimes. The Lord lets me listen to the songs they sing. “What
       happen to little Suzy, when mommy and daddy woke up and screamed at four o'clock in the
       morning. Her mommy and daddy screaming fussing and fighting. Now little Suzy is on dope.
        Let me tell you something mothers and fathers! When children see, their parents living in
       impurity and adultery it damages their minds and makes them unstable in their minds. Because

       children have got to respect and honor their parents. And when they see that their parents have
       no respect and honor of their marriage vows, brother the children have a warped mind.
        And that’s why we have produced the generation of yippee’s and hippies. But two wrongs,
       never did make it right. Their wrong and the parents are wrong and their wrong.
        Now this last Gentile people, ends up with sexual impurities. Until sex they make it such a
       God, until no more does men lust after women any longer. Some years ago, when a woman went
       down the street…A nice lookin woman went down the street with a little short hem-line every
       man turned his head and watched her till she was out of sight. Now! I notice the men, I go down
       town and there stands women not with a short hem line but standing in their underwear. No
       under clothes on, with no things on that women got to wear and don’t even wear them. They
       don’t even look! How many say, amen! (Amen) Why? Why? Why? Is because their lusts, HAVE
       BURNED OUT! Burned out, and now they no longer lust any more after a woman. Why? Is
       because she stripped herself off naked. And why would a young girl, want to wear those nasty
       britches and them short clothes. Don’t you realize your damaging the very thing that God set you
       on earth for?
        I wish I could preach this in Washington DC across the radio to every family in United States
       of America. And let them see what a terrible condition we’re in across this country.
        Now, now what’s happen? What’s happen now? Sexual impurities! Men who burn in their
       lusts after the women and the women stripped their self-off naked and opened their self-up for
       all…Just as Brother Branham said, “Nothing but a sex garbage can” He’s the only preacher, that
       ever heard that told the truth! How many say, amen? (Amen) He told the truth about it!
        And what else happen? Now the men no longer, have enough masculine…enough masculine
       genes in them to even lust after a woman. A natural thing, for a man to lust after a woman, he’s
       made for that. And when it comes to a place that man…Of course, it takes God to take that out of
       the heart. Is, that right? But he’s made for that. And when you see brother like it is today, that
       man does not even raise an eyebrow when beautiful women walk by…When my handkerchief
       would make the clothes that they got on. That’s no exaggeration! They never even raised their
       eyebrows! I’m talking about ungodly men, which should naturally looked till she went out of
       sight. And they don’t even raise their eyebrow! Why? Is because that their lust HAS BURNED
       OUT! And the masculine genes of man, has come to a place now where it’s turned into a
       perversion. That’s what he said right here in the book.
        Now what’s happen? Now the women what happen…Now they see that the man has turned,
       now what do they do? They turn in their lusts… their lust to another woman.
        And now there are even church clergyman marrying woman to woman and man to man. And
       a man kissing.
        Right over in the restaurant, Brother Gatlian come in the other day and said he was sick to his
       stomach. He said, “I was sitting there eating a hamburger and there was a guy just kissing
       another guy!” He said, “I’m gonna vomit, vomit right there in the restaurant”
        And then what our Statesman and are educators, “Well, I think it’s all right if they want to do
       that! We don’t want to be prejudice” God children! God have mercy upon us and help us in this
       hour!
        Why, it ought to cause our souls to scream out to God, night and day to get us out of such a
       filthy dirty wicked place as this. And what is it? It’s so common now, that even myself, we’re
       just taking it for granted, that it’s this way. When it ought to throw us into desperation.
        Now what this say? Twenty-six verse. Look at it saints. In closing!

       Romans 1:26-Scripture Reading;
       26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the
       natural use into that which is against nature:
        “Their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature.” Against nature!
       Nature itself, teaches you that woman is to have man and man is to have woman. To have those
       kinds of relationships to bring forth children and populate the earth and populate the millennium.
       Christians and ungodly souls, to populate nations of the world. But what happened the woman
       changed the natural use, which is to marry a man. And the man changed the natural use which is
       to marry a woman.
        And I want to say it right now! The Lord just bring it to my attention. Not that it’s in this
       congregation, but I don’t want it to get into this congregation. But I notice across the country,
       that there are parents…And I noticed this! That there are parents, that are trying to follow the
       message of the hour, see. Trying to follow the message of the hour don’t realize it, but they don’t
       want their child even their girl to even look at a boy. And they don’t want their young man to
       even look at a girl, see. They don’t want them to even have any fellowship at all. And they would
       never entertain the thought, they don’t want them to even think that their girl could possibly,
       possibly even have any interest in any boy. That it’s such a horrible thing. Why? That’s a natural
       thing. I heard preachers preach against little girls playing with dolls. Don’t you know that you
       could damage them little girl’s minds? Let them play with the dolls. You don’t want your little
       boys swinging out in a tree. Let them swing in a tree! You don’t want him riding a broomstick!
       Let him ride that broomstick. “Oh, I don’t want him to wrestle” Let him wrestle!” “I don’t want
       them to fight!” Let them fight a little bit! Well, I want my boy to wrestle! I want to see him
       climbing a tree! I don’t see my boy over there with little baby bottles playing with a little doll.
       I’ll snatch that thing out of his hands and say, “Get you a train there boy, or a truck.” Now how
       many say, amen to that? (Amen) Now I noticed that parents following this message, they don’t
       want… they can’t stand the thought of their girls growing up. And some of the most silliest
       things, they don’t want their children to do. That’s wrong! That’s wrong!
        I want my girl…Of course I’d like to see her so dedicated to God and filled with the Holy
       Ghost and would be just a virgin and serve the Lord all the days of her life, Like Anna in the
       temple. But if God ain’t called her to be that, see I don’t know. Now she’s interested in a
       Christian boy. I don’t want her interested in a boy that’s not a Christian. Then I’ll be honest, I’ll
       say, “Thank you father God, that’s wonderful! I sure thank you that my girl is interested in that
       fine Christian boy”
        But now see, the trouble with a lot of parents see, they don’t even want to even think that their
       girls would be interested in nobody. And then what? They start to force something upon those
       children that’s unnatural. Let your girls be natural! Let your boys be natural! How many say
       amen to that? (Amen) Let them be natural! Let them be natural! And I see parents around the
       country, I believe are missing the Lord and damaging the minds of their children, damaging the
       minds… God give the parents wisdom! God give us wisdom how to raise our children in this
       hour, see. Realize they’re little human beings and you can damage them and drive them away
       from the Lord. God will take care of it all.
        Now how many see the end of the Gentile world? The women losing the natural course of life
       with the man. The man losing the natural course of life with the woman. And now what you got?
        And even the great educators, that I have read in “Time Magazine” I can’t remember the
       names, I can’t remember all that. But great Educators have givin instructions to United States
       
       83
       Government on Philosophy psychology and everything that say, “That it’s better if they come to
       the place, where they don’t have no marriage vows. Just let the man and woman live together
       and see if they are compatible and then you won’t have all these divorce cases and law suits and
       all that. Let the teenagers have free sex. See, we found out that it’s the ole era that we’re in, put
       sex as evil and put in the minds of people and this is what has got us all in the trouble that we’re
       in. If they’ll let them have free sex, they’ll no more be guilty.” Them dirty filthy devil possessed
       educators are just sending people to hell, by the millions by their doctrine false knowledge
       they’re putting out.
        No… God honors marriage, God honors marriage but fornicators and adulterers he will judge
       children. And why is the wrath of God? Why is California gonna sink? Why is America gonna
       sink, why is Russia gonna burn it? Why is he gonna do it? Because of what I just read,
       fornication, adultery, free sex, immorality all this.
        Now let’s read the rest of it and I won’t mention…I had a lot of things, a lot of good things in
       these verses here, but we don’t have time.
        Now listen here! Let’s read the twenty-eighth verse. Do you congregation see this taking
       place right before your very eyes? (Amen) Now listen here. The twenty-eighth verse.
       Romans1:28-Scripture Reading;
       28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, [Here we go!] God gave them
       over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
        Why are they living like they are, in Fornication, free sex, all these things that’s goin on. Just
       swap wives and do anything that they want to. Why are they doin it? Because God gave up on
       them. He turned them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things. And when you see the
       generation of people doin those things, that is the end of all flesh that’s come upon the earth.
       That’s all of it! Is that a flashing red light of his coming? (Amen) I’ll say it is! Verse 29, watch
       this.
       Romans 1:29-31-Scripture Ad Lib Reading;
       29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness;
       full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
       30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to
       parents,
       31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
        Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness;
       full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful,
       proud, boasters, inventors of evil things” Did you ever see an hour…did you ever see and hour
       when people are inventing more evil things, than you have ever heard of in your life? Is, that
       true? Blasphemer’s haters of God! “Backbiters, boasters, proud, Fornicators.” There never was
       an hour, where there was fornication like is upon the earth now.
        A girl… if I in my day, if you ever saw a girl “thumbing” (A person who is hitchhiking a ride
       using his or her thumb on their hand) you would faint and run off the road and have a wreck.
        Now I go to the Naval Bases, I go up to Massachusetts traveling on the highway, beautiful
       girls, beautiful girls out there, no clothes on little sachet bag there with bed rolled up in it and
       their thumb out smiling. Pick me up, take me with you!
       
       84
        Don’t you realize, that’s the wrath of God is in the heavens. Oh, how we ought to cry out,
       “Lord God have mercy upon me, get me out of here, she’s ready to sink, she’s ready to burn!”
       See, we just take it as common. Oh, may God burn this down in our hearts, with an iron pen, that
       God’s wrath is heaping up, building up in the heavens ready to be poured out. See, any day!
        Let’s keep in step little Bride! Let’s keep in step with the fear of God. The judgments of God
       is getting ready to be poured out and we don’t want to be here.
        Watch here now.
       Romans1:30-Scripture Reading;
       30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to
       parents,
        “Proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to [What?] “Disobedient to parents,”
        Here we are, teenagers! The Bible tells you just what you’ll do. Oh, how the teenagers need to
       run, run from the lusts of the flesh, run from the things of the world. Realizing that those that do
       these evil things…those…the Bible…Listen, one of the commandments children.
        Now I’m your dear pastor, God bless you precious little teenagers, I love you! God give me
       something to say, to try to help you. But the wages of sin is death! The wages of sin is death! Go
       out eat drink and be merry, have a big time, go on the way the other teenagers are goin, but it’s
       gonna cost you your soul, burning in the lake of fire! And you ain’t got no time left.

       40 “Then I seen the United States as one smoldering, burnt-over place. It will be near the

       prediction, I base, because of the onrushing slaught that’s coming now, how fast that it was

       listening to Rock-in-roll music and having a big time? Wearing…Oh God! Is it, worth it? Is it,

        I never dreamed, my boy would stand up and talk to me the way he has. Why? Is because it’s

       saying, “The devil made me do it!” Why did you let him do it? Everybody in hell is gonna use

       for Christians; hell was made for unbelievers. And God has did everything that He can to keep
       people to bypass hell so that you won’t have to go there. He sent the law; He sent the prophets;
       He sent His Son. He sent the Holy Spirit. He sent the churches, the hymns, the everything to try
       to keep you from going to hell. Hell was not made for people. Said… Hell was created for the
       devil and his angels; not for human beings. But if you go, it’s because you willfully and want
       to go. And you can’t go easy. You have to fight your way into it. Did you know that? You can’t

       62-0124 - Have Not I Sent Thee?
       William Marrion Branham
       28 May the Lord add His blessings to these Words. Now, we’re all familiar with the Scripture
       that I’ve just read, all reads the Bible. It was a time of the judges, when there was a—well, kind
       of a time between… From the kings, God has had judges. And there had been several judges.
       And every time that the… God would get the people straightened out, they’d all try to—to go to
       doing right after He’d send judgment or something. And then the first thing you know, they’d fall
       away again. It’s just natural for people to do that. It’s just human for them to do it: fall away.
       And—and as soon as they fall away, then God’s judgment comes right in again. See? You cannot
       do wrong and get by, ’cause God is just. 29 Now, He just… He… In order to be just, He must—
       He must keep His laws. And law without penalty is not law. See? If there’s a semaphore out here
       in the street, and that says “stop,” that’s a law for you to stop. And then if you pass on through it
       and the law has no penalty, then it isn’t a law anymore. See? It should not even be hanging
       there. And if God begins to wave something before you and tell you that you’re doing wrong, and
       you break that law of God warning you, then penalty is to be paid. You just must do it. You have
       to do it; you have to pay the penalty. “And the wages of sin is death.” So if a man transgresses
       God’s law and continues to do it, then don’t blame God if something happens to you. See? If
       you’re lost, you cannot say, “Well, it was God’s fault.” I’ve often said this, that a man has to
       literally fight his way to hell. He cannot go to hell easy. No, he has a hard time getting to hell.
       But he certainly fights his way right on into it.

        Our own professor right down here at the school said, “Why are you taking your boy out of
       school?” I said, “Well sir, this is one reason I don’t want him to go to school. He never heard a
       cuss word, he never heard a dirty filthy joke, he never seen his father cuss smoke and drink, he
       never heard those dirty filthy things, till you got him in your school. And now everything that I
       put in him, holiness, righteousness, the fear of God and keeping the word of God. You take it all
       out of him.” I said, “I believe my daughters being virgins and being married as a virgin. I don’t
       believe in free sex; I don’t believe in fornication and all this wicked dirty filthy things. All these
       dirty nasty jokes.” Boy, I poured it on him! He wanted out of the car, but I had him in there and
       he couldn’t get out. I poured the gospel to him! I said professor, “Tell me one thing that your
       education has done for my children? Find out if you will, how many virgins you got in your
       school? That’s what I’m concerned about, is morals, character and honesty and the fear of God.”
       He said, “I’d hate to have an examination to find out.” He was glad to get out of the car!

       coming to your house with a pistol and he will kill you. In my country, there had been many a
       man lying in the graveyard now, for calling a man a liar when he wasn’t a liar. Don’t you never
       call a mountain man, in that generation back there in that of my fathers, don’t you never call one
       of them mountain folks a liar, he’ll kill you. Because he honored his word, even if it meant death.

       can lie and cheat the most.
        Let’s bow our heads children. Now I’m sorry I had to take so long, but the Lord just lead that

       anything you’ve had this week. What God’s done for you this morning and what you’ve heard
       this morning, will be everlasting to your soul.

        Now if our sisters will come, we’ll sing a hymn. Just play us a chores, “Jesus Keep Me Near
       the Cross.”
        Where will you be, children, where will you be? mother and father, sister or brother? God
       help us to flea this untoward generation. Knowing that the wrath of God is reserved in heaven, is
       ready to belch across the earth.

       64-1227 - Who Do You Say This Is?
       William Marrion Branham
       7 We find ourselves, at this Christmas, just about like they did the first Christmas though. The
       world’s just about to fall apart. As I preached on once, somewhere, about a Christmas message,
       The World Falling Apart. And the world again is just about to come to pieces. Look at the
       earthquakes over here in California. I predict, before the coming of the Lord Jesus, that God
       will sink that place. I believe that Hollywood and Los Angeles, and them filthy places over
       there, that God Almighty will sink them. They’ll go beneath the bottom of the sea. And it’s so
       much sin, you see, it’s the barrier. 48 Civilization has traveled with the sun, from…and it started
       in the East, going west. And now it’s at the West Coast. If it goes any further, it’ll be back East
       again. So that’s the barrier. And sin has traveled with civilization, and it becomes the cesspool
       of all ages. Things they do that—that human beings in any other age wouldn’t have thought of
       such a thing. Woman has throwed theirself to such a filth, till no woman in any age would’ve
       ever thought of such a thing as we do today. And then still call ourselves Christians. What a
       disgrace! 49 No wonder the great prophet raised up, and he said, “I’m not a prophet nor the son
       of a prophet, but…” Said: The lion has roared, and who cannot fear? And…God has spoke, and
       who can keep from prophesy? See? There’s something that’s got to call out. 50 We’re in a
       
       88
       critical hour; the world is. But the Church, the real Church (not the denomination); but the
       Church, Itself, is ready for the greatest triumph It ever made: the coming of the Groom to the
       Bride. 51 We are coming apart, looking for a messiah (something) to come and save us, get us
       out of all of it.
       Closing Prayer by Brother Lambert:
        Dear heavenly father, we thank thee for thy word. We thank thee for thy promise Lord. For
       the opening of the book. We thank you for the washing of our souls Lord, to the purifying of our
       souls, by your word. Oh Lord, won’t you please help us God. Oh God, when we look around and
       see such vileness and wickedness Lord. And see the atmosphere plagued with demons, putting
       evil thoughts into the people’s minds and in their hearts. Until Lord you looked upon the earth
       and you said, “The thoughts of man minds are wicked continually, and I will destroy man that I
       made.” Lord we’ve come to the end of all flesh again. God, please help us Lord, to not let all
       these wicked flashing red lights of your coming get common to us, around us Lord. But help us
       Lord to look at these signs and stay at the foot of the cross. Oh Jesus, keep us near the cross, near
       the bloody fountain Lord. Watching and waiting and purifying our souls, by the washing of the
       water of thy word and by prayer and obedience to the word of God. May we slip on the white
       linen garment, the righteousness of the saints. Lord Help us in this congregation! God help our
       precious children Lord. Each mother and father here God, bless the children Lord. Give them a
       great desire to live in the millennium Lord. To forsake the youthful lusts of this hour. Lord let
       them look around and God and see the teenagers what condition they’re in and the parents, Lord.
       Wretched, miserable, poor, blind, dope addicts, alcoholics, cigarette smokers Lord. Oh, God
       tryin to ease their soul by dope Lord, alcohol, dinning and wining, oh God. Lord help us, to let
       these things vex our soul. Make us miserable and uncomfortable here on earth God. Oh, Lord
       Jesus we thank you for the conviction of the Holy Ghost, that was here in the congregation Lord,
       before the minister got here. Thank you for what you’ve done yesterday. And feeling God that
       your spirit would return here and be here this morning. I thank you father. God let me leave this
       building this morning with a greater determination Lord God, to serve you with all my heart, all
       my mind and all my strength Lord. God if you don’t come next month, next year or whenever it
       is Lord, God help me to keep my eyes upon Jesus Christ upon the promise of the hour. And Lord
       above all men, Lord help me to bare up under my load and my responsibility God, to stand at my
       post of duty Lord. God bless every soul hear, that they may be faithful Lord, as soldiers Lord
       that’s called to conquer this enemy today. Help us to conquer the enemy for you today and take
       ground and press into that great glorious event Lord. God bless every man in this assembly Lord,
       make them a man of God that’s strong and valent and courageous Lord. God help us to be honest
       with ourselves and realize Lord when we’re wrong and do that which is right. Bless us all God,
       help us to be strict, sober Lord. And we’ll thank you for all these things, in Jesus name, amen.
        Let’s stand to our feet. We’ll sing this one hymn and we’ll be dismissed.
       Congregation sings “Jesus Keep Me Near the Cross”

       Brother Lambert prays opening prayer:
        Let’s bow our heads in a word of prayer, please!
       Our most loving gracious heavenly father, we’re gathered here again in this little store front
       building, in the closing hours of time upon this lost and dying world. Father we’re so thankful
       that thou hast givin us a way out, in this time of great perplexity among the nations of the world
       and among the people. God we’re so thankful that you sent Jesus Christ, that he might redeem us
       out from among mankind. That we might be a chosen people, a peculiar race of people, a
       supernatural people father that would be able to manifest Jesus Christ upon this earth. Lord we
       have a wonderful opportunity in this hour. Where sin is abounding very highly Lord, we pray
       that grace might much more abound. Those that have excepted thee, in thy provided way of
       salvation today. Oh Lord, we pray for all of thy people all over the world. And oh Lord, our
       prayer is father, that they may be gathered together in a perfect oneness of Jesus Christ in this
       last hour. That the people of this world might know, who is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ.
       Prove to this world, that thou hast loved us father! And then Lord let there be a great revival
       brake out among the just, the righteous and the holy father, the ones that you have chosen. Then
       Lord take thy little children home, before all this great hydrogen bombs turn this world into fire
       father. That even the atmosphere would burn, father. Have mercy upon us, oh Lord! And help us
       to do thy will! Help us to cleave to thy word, and hide it away in our hearts. Help us to live lives
       that will be worthy of the gospel. And Lord most of all, give us that tremdous victory in the Love
       divine. Help us oh Lord, to love our neighbors as ourselves. Help us to love our enemies and do
       good to those that despise us and misuse us, that we may be called the children of God. And then
       Lord, help us to love one another Lord! By this you said, “That all man will know that you are
       my disciples, when you have love one towards the other.” Father the world is dying for Love this
       morning. Give us of thy great perfect love Lord, that we may love the way that you would have
       us to love. Bless every soul that’s here, in this little sender block store front building. God bless
       them, that they may not leave the door of this building without becoming a better person, without
       excepting Christ as their savior and their God, their provider and all that goes with thee father.
       Bless all the strangers that are within our gates. Bless thy unworthy minister father. Lord we feel
       not worthy, to raise our eyes and lift them to heaven. But Lord be merciful to us each one and
       help us today to say something, to help a dying people. In Jesus name, amen.
        You may be seated. Good morning, to each and every one of you, brothers and sisters and
       friends alike. I’m very thankful to be alive this morning. And count it a great honor and a great
       privilege, to stand before people and preach the word of God.
        We believe in this hour, that heavens and earth is gonna pass away. And the only thing that’ll
       stand is the word of the Lord, for it’s pure. Every word of God is pure!
      
       2
        And that’s one thing, we’re living in an hour that you have to sign papers and form statements
       that you’ll keep your word. But I’m so thankful, that I’m acquainted with a God this morning
       that keeps his word. That we can take him at his word and he will keep his word. And then I’m
       so thankful to be acquainted with a people, that keeps they’re word also. In an hour when nobody
       trust anybody. But we’re so thankful that we have something, that we can gather ourselves
       around.
        And I was thinking this morning, that I would kinda change the manner of my preaching, for
       some reason or other. I thought maybe, I would preach on security. I was thinking about the
       word security, the other day. It seems like that’s the theme, of all the thinking of all the
       American people at this time is, security. Everybody is seeking security. And we find out, that so
       many thought they had security, found out they didn’t have any security.
        We find that many people in America have left their great homelands of many countries
       around the world, to come to United States for security. And beloved, I’m here this morning to
       tell you, this is the most insecure place that I know of on the earth today. This is the worst nation
       to be in, on the face of the earth that I know of. It would be a lot safer in Red China or Russia,
       then it would to be in United States. One day we had security in United States, because God was
       with United States.
        And we sing that great song, “God Bless America” And we have found out that God has
       blessed America. And now, it’s turning into a curse. Everything that our government does, seems
       to go wrong. Everything is going wrong in America.
        And the only thing that is goin right, is Gods people that are walking with the word. I believe
       the only security that’s in the world today, lies in Jesus Christ the immaculate son of God, his
       word and his plan. So therefore, if I speak this morning on security, I want you to know that the
       only security that I can offer you this morning, is the eternal security of Jesus Christ. Because all
       else is a false security.
        I’m especially blessed in service this morning, to have my younger brother Don and his
       precious little wife Harriet. It’s a great pleasure to have them with us. And we have some friends
       here, I think they’re from Pennsylvania. Cause, I seen a strange car outside, with Pennsylvania
       license plates on it.
        Well, we’re certainly proud of the all foke’s from Pennsylvania. Some of the people here,
       have left from so journey in the state of Pennsylvania and left fine people down there in the great
       state. Some of them drove all the way from near Harrisburg, I think it’s Lebanon Pennsylvania
       about twenty miles out of Harrisburg. That’s a long drive, because I have driven it many times
       myself. They have heard the gospel, that I have preached and have drove them and their little
       families, every weekend through the rain and through the snow for as much as eighteen months.
       And then drive all that distance back and then work all the next day. So consequently, it has
       turned to them for a great testimony in this country here.
        No matter where you go, way up the coast here they find out that I’m a preacher and want to
       know where my church is at and said, “They have heard of it!” And so those things, get around.
       Because around this country here in the summer, they don’t even go to church. It’s too hot and
       the people want to play golf on Sunday. I tell you, I believe the people ought to be serving Jesus
       Christ on Sunday. We should serve the Lord! There is safety in serving the Lord.
        So, we’re thankful for the fokes from Pennsylvania. We got nothing to join, here. But this
       group is made out of people that have heard the revelation of God in this hour, and have moved
       across the country so they might strive to please the Lord Jesus. We’re not concerned here about
       building a great building, because we believe they’ll all burn in a little bit.
      
       3
        I’m afraid and think it’s ashamed for all the begging and pull'in and striving, that the line of
       the so-called churches…You notice I said, “So-called churches” You know there is a right way,
       to say the right thing. So-called churches of United States. They build great buildings worth
       millions of dollars. Then it’s a great race, to see which one can build the most beautiful building.
       What good is a building, if the spirit of Christ isn’t in it? What good is it?
        But you’re the building that God’s building to dwell in. You the boy, you’re the girl, you’re
       the man, you’re the woman that Jesus Christ, you’re the building he wants to get into. He can’t
       do much with stone and wood, but he can do something with a human being.
        So, all those great buildings they gather in them about fifteen minutes. About fifteen minutes
       on Sunday morning. And they get up and talk about politics or Romeo and Juliet.
        I’m so thankful, that we have something to talk about this morning and that’s the Jesus Christ
       God almighty made flesh. And when you talk about him you talk about something that’s eternal,
       something that’s secure.
        So, we certainly pray that God will bless each one of you. I usually, don’t use to many
       scriptures to speak on. But I’ll try not to hold you too long, but I have been known to preach to
       two o'clock.
        You know, people in this town, are too afraid to ask us to much in this town, afraid that we’ll
       tell them more than what they already know. And they see these people come in here, around
       nine-thirty am and sit here and meditate upon the Lord another thirty minutes before song service
       starts. And then they see the doors coming open out there the neighbors about one-thirty. Then
       they see them standing outside there talking for another hour. So, I suppose it’s a very odd thing
       to the neighbors.
        There was a great man of God in this last day, preached a message called “Odd-ball.” So, I
       suppose we are very odd! But I think if you’ll look in the Bible, we’ll find out that Gods people
       is to be an odd people, peculiar people.
        Now if you’ll open your Bibles. And I would like to ask you as Christians and those of you
       that read your Bibles, I’d like for you to read the 5th and the and the seventeenth chapter of John.
       They are three marvelous chapters that are full of good wonderful things, about the security of
       the believer.
        Of course, I believe for every question that you might gender in your mind, there’s only one
       true answer to your question. Now there’s many opinions, givin to that questions that’s asked.
       But there’s only one true answer that can be givin. So therefore, that’s why I try to never put my
       opinion on what anything Christ said.
        Because if you’ll look up the word opinion, it also means heresy. Because you could have an
       opinion…Well, in America people are great people for opinions, upon the word of God. “Well, I
       think I it means this!” But really, we don’t have any thinking comin at all. Because the Bible
       said, “Let Gods word be true and every man found a liar.” So, God’s word is always true!
       Romans 3:4-Reference quote:
       God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be
       justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
        So, if we’re ever gonna make heaven our home…And all churches sing about goin to heaven.
       But friend, it’s late in the day, and let’s face the facts! Not everybody is goin to heaven, that
       say’s their goin to heaven. Because if they are, then we’re gonna have to preach up there,
       because it’s gonna be a mess. How many say amen to that? (Amen)
      
       4
        So, we’ll find out here in a minute, if you’ll give me a few minutes of your time, we’ll see just
       who’s gonna make heaven their home.
        Now let’s read first, I think before I go into John. Let’s read for a text, over in the book of
       Ephesians.
        The way I minister, I don’t have no education and I just trust God. And as things come to me
       out of his word, I just put it together by his help.
        Ephesians 1, I’m still in Galatians, I got a new Bible I’m trying to break in, and it sticks
       together. Let’s start reading now in verse three, of Ephesians 1:3.
       Ephesians 1:3,4
       3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual
       blessings in heavenly places in Christ:
       4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be
       holy and without blame before him in love:
       “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual
       blessings in heavenly places in Christ: According” Now watch this now! “According as he hath
       chosen us in him before the foundation of the world”
        Now when we’re you chosen to be in Christ? Not when you excepted the Lord that morning
       when you heard the preacher, or who ever witnessed to you or track you read. But you we’re
       excepted in Christ, before the world was ever created. Now friend this is pretty sound security, if
       you ask me. You we’re in Christ, before the foundation of the world.
        Also, he said, “That we should be holy” When we’re we holy? We were holy in him, before
       the foundation of the world. “And without blame” We we’re without blame! Which means you
       never did sin in the first place!
        The scriptures speaking here, that the believer in Christ is so perfect and so secure in Jesus
       Christ, that God looks at him as he never did sin in the first place.
       Ephesians 1:5-13
       5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to
       the good pleasure of his will,
       6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
       7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches
       of his grace;
       8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
       9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he
       hath purposed in himself:
       10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in
       Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:
       11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose
       of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
       12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
       13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in
       whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
      
       5
        “Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according
       to the good pleasure of” Who’s will? “HIS WILL, To the praise of the glory of his grace,
       wherein he hath made us accepted” He hath made us accepted” see, “in the beloved.” That’s
       Jesus Christ! Now watch here, in the seventh verse. In whom we have redemption” Of sin, in whom we have redemption “through his blood, the
       forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; Wherein he hath abounded toward us in
       all wisdom and prudence;
       Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he
       hath purposed in himself:
        Looks like, one person is doin it all! Don’t it?
       That in the dispensation” Here is a wonderful scripture prophesy, right here before your eyes.
       That in the dispensation of the fulness of times”
        Now how many knows and believes and knows that the end of the world is here? Be honest!
       (Amen) There’s not a one of you would want to be livin here, twenty-five years from now.
       Everything is at an end. See!
        “That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one”
       Now here’s your real bride. Here is your real true church. Coming forth into view, in the fullness
       of time! When all time is at an end and when time is run out. See, as long as we have
       governments upon this earth we’re in time. But there is gonna be a day arrive, when time is
       gonna run out.
        And then you’re gonna be in eternity and that is the millennium. The Bride will be eternal in
       the millennium. But the millennium will be a space of time also, a thousand years.
        Now notice here! That’s so good, let me just go ahead and read it all.
       “That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in
       Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth”
        Now there’s your rapture taking place. Many people that go to church, don’t believe in a
       rapture. There’s your rapture! The word rapture is not in the Bible, but it’s the Catching up,
       caught up, raptured. Caught up raptured, to meet him in the air. All that are sleeping in the graves
       will come upon the earth. And then all the believers that are upon the earth, will all be caught up
       together, to meet the Lord Jesus in the air and so shall we forever be with the Lord. When will it
       be? In the end-time! It’s at the end of the world.
        Now watch verse 11. “
       In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated
       according to the purpose of HIM” His purpose, that we have an inheritance.
       “who worketh all things” This person God, who worketh all things, all things after the counsel
       of HIS own will:
       That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ
       In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in
       whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
       God had a blessing to the reading of his word.
        Now for a subject…Now I may go on with this for two or three Sunday’s maybe. I won’t near
       be able to finish it this morning.
       “God’s Unconditional Covenant to the Elected Bride” This unconditional covenant is only to an
       selected chosen group of people. And this is a covenant… And a covenant has got to be between
       at least two persons to make a covenant.
      
       6
        Now notice, this covenant is made by the Lord God and a selected number of people that
       gonna be chosen out of the earth, called Christians. Now, this is a love covenant. I like it to a
       love covenant of God to his people.
        And it’s not if you will! If you will do this! If you will quit drinking! If you will quit
       smoking! If you will quit fornication. If you will quit committing adultery! See, those things
       doesn’t enter into the picture here.
        It’s God’s will! God’s purpose! God’s plan for you on earth, and he is gonna bring you…He’s
       is gonna bring you to this great salvation.
       Now it’s God Unconditional Covenant, it’s not on conditions. He’s already done it!
        You seen, the Old Testament Covenant that was to Israel, if you’ll do this! If you’ll walk in
       my way! If you’ll do this, if you’ll do this, then I’ll do this!
        But to the elected Bride it’s these words, it’s already done! It’s already finished! It’s already
       done, you just believe it!
        And why I’m bring this, I want to try to knock off all the loose feathers out of this
       congregation, to try to show them what a great legal place that they have as a believer on Christ.
        Now notice, the first thing that I want to take under consideration, in this unconditional
       covenant to the elected Bride, is that I want to say that every Born-Again child of God is, the
       almighty God’s gift to Christ! They are presents to the Son Jesus Christ! See!
        Now notice, that Christ is Eternal! But Jesus had a beginning. See, there’s a right way to say
       that! Christ was Eternal! Jesus had a beginning! And God has givin Christ Jesus, the believer as
       Love Gifts-Presents! I think that’s an appropriate gift. That would be a wonderful Christmas
       present, that God has givin you to Christ.
        Every Born…Oh, I just love that right there. Every Born-Again child of God, is givin to
       Christ as a present! As a present! Ain’t that wonderful!
        Now notice! If you’ll open your Bibles, so you’ll see these are not my words. Leave your
       Bibles open to John. So, you can look at these scriptures and read them when you go home and
       meditate upon them.
        Now watch this! Love Gift to Christ;
       John 6:37-Reference quote:
       37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise
       cast out.
       “All that the Father giveth me…All that the father giveth me, shall come to me, Christ Jesus,
       See. “And him that” That is this gift, see. “That cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.”
       Is that security? (Amen) Sounds like security, don’t it?
        You know right now, that this preacher don’t believe in that stuff, that your saved today and
       lost tomorrow! Backslide and up and down and in and out. No Sir! That’s not found in the pages
       of God’s word, nowhere! I wouldn’t even run my business like that. No sir!
        We as Christians, if we are Born-Again Christians, we are gifts to Christ by God the Father!
       See, all that the father giveth me, shall come to me. And when that person comes to me, I will in
       no wise cast him out, I will except him. See!
        Now notice in John seventeen and six. Let’s see, we need more than one witness, don’t we?
       Let’s read;
      
       7
       John 17:6
       6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they
       were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
        Jesus said, “I have manifested thy name unto” these gifts “which thou gavest me out of the
       world:
       See, these gifts we’re in the world. “ I have manifested thy name” to these gifts which thou gavest
       me out of the world thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
       Ain’t that wonderful! See!
        Now notice, that before these gifts…Oh, I just love his now! I’ll get to preachin' if I don’t
       watch out! All these gifts that we’re givin to Christ, who did they belong to before they we’re
       givin to Christ? They belonged to the Father God the spirit! And the spirit gave them to the son!
       Now listen, before you can give a present away it’s got to be yours first. And if it is a present,
       then there is no price tag on it. It is a free, unmerited gift!
       Definition of Unmerited: Reference quote: not adequately earned or deserved: not merited
       an unmerited award
       Ephesians 1:6 tells us that by God's grace (unmerited favor), God “made us accepted in the
       Beloved.” In the original Greek text, the word “accepted” is the word charitoo, which means
       “highly favored.” So, because God has placed you in Christ the Beloved, you are highly
       favored!
        I never did belong to the devil friend! GOD WAS MY FATHER, AND ALWAYS HE WAS
       MY FATHER! I never did belong to the devil! I never was a child of the devil! I was a child of
       God from Eternity.
        And the only way a person can EVER BE SAVED, they had to be WITH GOD THE
       FATHER BEFORE THE WORLD WAS EVER CREATED!
        Oh, it’s a shame that the churches around this country, don’t know their Bible any more than
       they do! No wonder the people are so confused. No wonder, the theologians don’t believe in the
       virgin birth. There’s something wrong!
       John 17:6-Reference quote: 6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world, and thou
       gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
        John 17:6, see. “I have manifested thy name” to those gifts that thou hast givin “me out of the
       world:” Thine they were, they we’re thine, see. But now thou hast gavest them me! Now they’re
       mine!
        Now friend, it’s an unthinkable thing that the heavenly father that would give such gifts to his
       sons, only later to find out that he lost his gifts! NOW, COME ON!
       Boy, don’t I wish I had some of those preachers here this morning!
       It’s unthinkable that the father God, being the God that he is would give his son a gift and then
       later, to only to find out that that gift perished or he took it back or he lost it. Let me tell you
       something, a Navajo Indian wouldn’t even do that! He’s not an Indian giver!
      
       8
       Indian giver- Reference quote definition: is an American expression, used to describe a person
       who gives a "gift" and later wants it back, or who expects something of equivalent worth in
       return for the item.
       "You can't take it back! Don't be an Indian giver."
       Sound familiar? It's the schoolyard taunt that's been used for generations by children (and
       others) to describe people so ungenerous that they take back gifts as soon as they are given or
       immediately demand a present in return.
        Now notice that Jesus said, “If a son ask bread and will he give him a stone?” “Or if he ask a
       fish, will he give him a serpent”
       Matthew 7:9-Reference quote:
       10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
       9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
       Matthew 7:11-Reference quote:
       11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall
       your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
       
        Said, if you being a natural father knoweth how to give good gifts to your children, how much
       more shall your heavenly father give you the Baptism of the Holy Ghost that you’re asking for?
       How much more shall he do it. If you asked for a loaf of bread, would he get a stone? If you
       asked for a fish will he give you a serpent? I don’t believe so!
        I believe that there’s gonna be an elected number of people on earth, that’s gonna ask the
       heavenly father for the true Baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal of God and they’re gonna get it!
       How many is asking for it? (Amen) God’s gonna give you the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.

       61-0216 - The Mark Of The Beast and The Seal Of God #1
       William Marrion Branham
       4 Now, I’m going to base the Scripture… First, I’m going to tell you what I think the mark of the
       beast is and what the—I think the Scripture supports the mark of the beast to be. Then I’m going
       to tell you what I think the Scripture supports the seal of God. Now, we know that these two great
       things are ending up soon into two great, great grips; the world is gripped by these two things
       right now: the mark of the beast or the seal of God. Some of them places it way over in the
       future; some says it’s already been in the past. But I believe that there’s just two answers to it.
       And that is that the seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost; the mark of the beast is
       rejecting it. Now, that’s the only two things. I going give you Scripture why now as we go
       through. Now, one of them is remember, all the peoples on earth in the last days is either going
       to be sealed by the seal of God or marked by the mark of the beast. And he caused all, both poor,
       great, bond, free, all upon the earth to receive this mark who did not have the seal, and whose
       names are not written in the Lamb’s Book of Life since the foundation of the world, from the
       foundation of the world when the Lamb was slain and when their names were put on the
       Lamb’s Book of Life. 15 Now, those two great things. Now, we’re going to start first upon “The
      
       9
       Seal Of God.” Now, what is a seal? The first place, a seal in the Bible, back in days before
       people had—educated like they are now, they usually—their seal was their signature just like we
       use today as our name. Sometimes the Romans, and on back in Jewish, and way back in the early
       eastern countries, they’d have a ring, that had their seal, and stamp it on something. If they
       couldn’t sign their name, that seal. A seal was a bona fide statement, that it was sealed by this
       seal. And to—to try to copy this, was a capital fine, just like it would be now to try to forge a
       check, somebody’s name on a check. It was a—a great fine to try to copy this seal. And usually
       the man wore it, had his seal, wore it on his back of his wrist, or—or either on his ring. And he
       would seal it instead of signing his name. That was to show that—that it was—he had sealed it.
       16 Now. Now, Jesus said that in the last days, according to Saint Matthew the 24th chapter and
       the 24th verse, that these two spirits, this—the ones that was sealed with God, and the ones that
       would be marked by the beast, the antichrist, would be so close together till it would as deceive
       the very elected if it was possible. See? Now, they’re going to be so much alike. Now, some
       people says, “Well, communism is the mark of the beast.” You’re wrong. Communism is not the
       mark of the beast, yet it is, but it isn’t heading up. The—the mark of the beast is of—is a religious
       nature, very religious, so cunning and sly, until it’ll deceive the very elected if it was possible,
       just so close till it would deceive the elected if it was possible. Of course, they…

       William Marrion Branham
       257 But these, here, wasn’t. Then, watch what He done. He said, “Put a mark on their
       forehead.” What kind of a mark was it? I’ll read it to you, Acts 2. “They were all with one
       accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound, the Angel coming from Heaven.” You
       say, “The Angel was a sound?” 258 What was it, what went before David, when he heard the
       rushing of the leaves, mulberry leaves, that night when he was afraid to just go forth? “Heard a
       sound from Heaven like a rushing mighty wind,” God is going before them. 259 “And
       suddenly there appeared unto them Holy Ghost and Power.” Out through the streets they went,
       leaping and jumping, and speaking in tongues, and stammering of lips, and shouting, and acting
       like a drunkard, and everybody just rejoicing and praising the Lord God. Isn’t that right? 260
       That’s the way God does when He sends His Power down with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
       And It moved in right there, and away went the Message! Hallelujah! And they shouted and
       screamed, and spoke in tongues, and went out there. And that was the mark that God put upon
       the people. Is that right? God put the mark, and that’s the kind of a mark God is going to put
       on His people today. The same seal of God that went on them there, under the baptism of the
       Holy Ghost, was the seal of God. 261 I want to ask you something, church. The Bible says that
       the mark of God, in that day, was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The seal that was on the
       people, to make them different from the others, was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That right?
       [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] The New Testament said, in Ephesians 4:30, that the Holy
       Ghost is the seal of God, for the people in the last days, unto your Eternal destination. That
       right? [“Amen.”] Then the Holy Ghost was right.
        Now notice here, I want to read a scripture, in Psalms 2 and 8. This will be a little slow but I
       believe we’ll nail'er down before it’s over! Let’s see, Psalms 2:8. Do you Love the word?
       (Amen) Now, watch here.
      
       10
       Psalms 2:8
       8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
       the earth for thy possession.
        “Ask of me, and I shall give thee” Now who is this speaking? This is the heavenly father,
       speaking to the son Christ Jesus our Lord! The heavenly father asked the son…Now look here
       ain’t this wonderful? He said now, “Jesus asked of me, and I’m gonna give you these people as
       gifts!” I want you to ask for them, so I can give them to you! Ain’t that wonderful? (Amen) The
       father is asking the son, to ask for something! Glory to God!
        Jesus Christ is asking you, “Ask anything in my name and I’ll do it!” Hitherto before you’ve
       asked nothing, but ask now that your joy may be made full!” He said to the believer, “Ask
       anything, in my name and I’ll do it!”
       John 16:24-Reference quote:
       24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be
       full.
        How many want to come to the place, that you can rest in God and ask anything in his name
       and get it? (Amen) Do you believe there’s somebody that’s gonna, do it? (Amen) Then if Jesus
       Christ is wanting you to ask abundantly, that your joy may be full, what’s the matter with the
       people today, that they’re not asking like they ought to! How many want to come to the place
       where you can do that? (Amen) Somebody has got to do it, it may as well be us, hadn’t it? How
       many want your joy to be just running over? (Amen) Why wouldn’t it run over, if you had such a
       God that you could ask him anything in his name and get it! Why it ought to make us run
       through the wall this morning, if we believed that. You talk'in about security brother! I’m talking
       about eternal security to the believers. Yes, sir!
        The father God asked Jesus Christ, to ask for our souls. He said, “Ask for them, I’m gonna
       give them to you.” Do you believe he asked? (Amen) Do you believe that he got them? Do you
       believe that you’ll ever lose them? I don’t! Amen!
        GLORY TO GOD, I BELIEVE CHRIST IS IN HIS WORD! I DON’T BELIEVE IN THIS
       SAVED TODAY AND LOST TOMORROW, THIS BACKSLIDDEN STUFF. IF JESUS
       CHRIST EVER SAVED YOU, YOUR JUST AS ETERNAL AS GOD IS! YOU’LL NEVER
       PARISH, YOU’LL NEVER COME UNTO CONDEMNATION. YOU’VE PAST FROM
       DEATH UNTO LIFE. HALLELUJAH TO GOD!
        God’s in his word! Let God’s word be true and every man found a Lair.
       Romans 3:4-Reference quote:
       4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be
       justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
        Oh, how precious it is that the father God would ask Jesus Christ to ask for our souls and then
       give them to him! Oh, I just love it I tell yeah!
        Notice, that he asked for a fish and he got a fish.
       No wonder Jesus said to the apostle Peter and all the apostles when he picked them up on the
       shore of Galilee. He said, “Come and follow me and I’ll make you a fisher of fish.” Man fish! Is,
       that right? (Amen)
      
       11
        We are the Rainbow trout fish of God! Rainbow is a covenant and that’s my favorite fish. The
       fish that’s got all the colors on it, that’s the one I love the most! Because we we’re the covenant
       fish that was with God, that was givin to Christ. BEFORE THE MOON WAS SPOKE INTO ITS
       PLACE AND BEFORE THE SUN EVER SHINED, I WAS GIVIN TO CHRIST. I NEVER
       WAS LOST! I NEVER DID SIN! I’M JUST AS HOLY AS GOD IS HOLY! I’m just as
       righteous as God is righteous! Why? Because I have his righteousness. I have his holiness! I ain’t
       got none of my own, but I got his, he’s is perfect!
        When he asked for fish, he got them didn’t he? (Amen) When he asked for bread, he got them
       didn’t he? (Amen) He never got a stone.
        Listen to this, the prophet Isaiah said in the fifty-third chapter of Jesus Christ he said, “He
       Jesus Christ the Messiah shall see his seed.” He shall see his gift. He shall see his seed and he
       shall see the travail of his soul.
       Isaiah 53:10-Reference quote:
       10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul
       an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of
       the Lord shall prosper in his hand.
       11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my
       righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
        Notice here that the soul of Christ was in travail and agony for these souls to be givin to
       him!
        No wonder when he sat on the well weary from his journey, in the third chapter of John.
       History says, the writer said, “He was sick with headache and weary from his journey” The Bible
       said, “He sat on the well, he was dusty weary from his journey.” And while the apostles went
       into town to get some bread and meat he sat there and along came a woman who was a prostitute.
       And when she come up, Jesus said, “Give me a drink woman!” She said, “You that you’re a Jew
       and I’m a Samaritan and we don’t talk to one another, we’re prejudice.” She said, “We don’t talk
       to one another.” He said, “Woman if thou newest the gift of God, and who it was that was
       speaking unto thee, you’d ask me for living water. And I would of gave it to you!” She said, “Sir
       evermore give me of this water, that I won’t have to come back here and draw anymore.” He
       said, “Alright go get your husband!”
        Weary as he was, he was still in a soul travail to find that gift that God had givin him! There
       was one of God’s gifts! That was givin to Christ before the foundation of the world! And no
       wonder the Bible said, “Jesus had need to go by Samaria.” Because he had a little gift up there,
       that was all dirty and filthy and was a prostitute. And brother, he had something that would clean
       her up with.
        He said, “Go get thy husband and come back here.” She said, “I ain’t got no husband!” He
       said, “In that thou said'est thou is true!” He said, “You’ve had five husbands and the man your
       sleeping with now is not your husband.” She said, “Sir! I perceive that thou art a prophet!”
        Oh, I wish the world could realize, WHAT’S HAPPEN IN THIS LAST DAY! THAT A
       MIGHTY PROPHET HAS RISEN UP IN THIS LAND! And has stood at the well of these
       denominations, and has asked us to recognize the gift of God and who it was that was speaking!
       So that we could ask for living water! How many is asking for living water? (Amen) Do you
       believe that you’ll receive it? (Amen)
      
       12
        Notice here, Isaiah said, “He shall see his seed!” “He shall see the travail of his soul and be
       satisfied.”
       Now, if you ask for bread and you eat the bread your satisfied, aren’t you? Jesus Christ is not
       asking for a natural fish or a natural loaf of bread! But he’s asking for our souls! And as Isaiah
       the prophet said that, “He shall see his seed, he shall see the travail of his soul and be satisfied.”
       Isaiah 53:11-Reference quote:
       11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my
       righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
       John 4:32- 34-Reference quote:
       27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man
       said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
       28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
       29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
       30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
       31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
       32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
       33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
       34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
        No wonder the Apostles said to Jesus… When they came back and found Jesus sitting down
       talking to a prostitute. It must of put some thinking in their mind! They said to Jesus, “Have you
       had anything to eat yet?” He said, “I have meat to eat, that you know not of.” I’ve got something
       I’m eaten on that you don’t know a thing about, boys! He said, “My meat is to do the will of my
       father, which has sent me!” I’ve got to go out here and find all these gifts that he give me.” He
       was about his father’s business.
        Notice here, he travailed in his soul for your soul. And he saw the travail of his soul and he
       saw his seed and he saw the travail of his soul and he was satisfied. Because God had give him
       what his soul was travailing for.
        And let me say this right here! When this congregation can get to the place, when their souls
       are travailing to see God pour out his spirit, then you are gonna receive what you’re travailing
       for. You’ll never get a revival “half hazard”!
       Reference meaning: Half-hazard:
       When something is made dangerous by being done in a half-hearted or half-witted fashion
       But when that desire for revival, comes down in your soul and your soul begins to travail to see
       God pour out the living water of the Holy Ghost, then we’ll get it.
        Now think about this! Once Jesus has obtained these particular gifts, once these souls come to
       Christ, they become his possession and his alone. They belong to Christ! They belong to Christ!
       You are gifts to Christ! See!
        Notice here, once they are givin to Christ, then he cannot be cheated out of these gifts. There’s
       no way that he can be cheated out of them.
        In other-words, they we’re givin to Christ the other night in the revival…As we put it. We’ll
       put it, like the preachers put it, you know. You know, you come up and except Christ as your
       personal savior and you got your name wrote on the lamb’s book of life, which you didn’t! If it
      
       13
       was there it was there before the world was ever created. And the only thing you done is, was
       recognize that you was always with him.
        Once these gifts have been givin to Christ, then Christ cannot be cheated out of them. Unless
       there is a power stronger than the Lord! Do you know anybody bigger than him? (No) Do you
       know anybody STRONGER THAN MY HEAVENLY FATHER? THERE IS NO MAN, THAT
       CAN PLUCK YOU OUT OF MY FATHER’S HANDS! FOR MY FATHER WHICH GAVE
       YOU TO ME, IS GREATER THAN ALL! AND ALL THAT HE GIVETH TO ME SHALL
       COME TO ME! AND HE THAT COMETH TO ME, I’LL RAISE HIM UP IN THE LAST
       DAY! So, he didn’t lost them, did he?
       John 10:28-Reference quote:
       28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
       them out of my hand.
       29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of
       my Father's hand.
       John 6:37-Reference quote:
       37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise
       cast out.
       38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
       39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should
       lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
        How many are feeling secure already? (Amen) Oh God, we’ll knock the cob webs out of this
       thing here this morning, by the help of God! And kill the spider to!
        See! Unless there is a power stronger than the Lord’s! I don’t know of any! HE’S ALL
       POWER! HE’S ALL AUTHORITY! HE’S ALL GOD! THERE IS NO GOD OUTSIDE OF
       JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD! HE’S THE ALMIGHTY GOD! THE EVERLASTING
       FATHER! THE PRINCE OF PEACE! HE’S THE ALPHA AND OMEGA THE BEGINNING
       AND THE END! THE FIRST AND THE LAST, HE WHICH WAS AND IS. WAS DEAD
       AND NOW IS ALIVE FOR EVER MORE! Amen!
       I don’t know anything as powerful enough to take these gifts away from us! Yes sir!
        Now notice in John 1and 1 the Bible said, “In the beginning was God!” Is, that right? “In the
       beginning was the word and the word was God.” And this word in the first verse in John 1 and 1.
       “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” And in
       the 14th verse of 1 John said, “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us”
       John1:1
       In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
       John 1:14
       14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
       the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
      
       14
       John 1:12
       12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them
       that believe on his name:
        And so, we know that the word in John 1, is the Logos, which means a thought or expression
       that came out from God. See! Now just as Christ was in the thinking of the spirit of God. See!
       Aren’t you your thinking? Don’t tell me! You are what our thoughts are. See! And then when
       your thoughts become word, then your words become an expression of what you we’re thinking.
        AND WHEN WE SEEN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST COME ON THE SCENE, THEN WE
       SAW THE THINKING OF GOD! HALLELUJAH! WE SAW WHAT GOD HAD BEEN
       THINKING ABOUT, BEFORE THE WORLD WAS EVER CREATED! No wonder we’re
       understanding the mystery of God now made manifested, before our very eyes! God is letting us
       probe into his thinking!

       54-1003M - The Word Became Flesh (India Trip Report)
       William Marrion Branham
       170 Now, but, here it tells us, that, before there was a man. Before! “In the beginning was the
       Word, and the Word was God, and the Word was with God. And, the Word, made flesh!” Now,
       just about as far as the human mind can go, that’s as far as we can go back now, to “the
       beginning.” Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] “In the beginning was the
       Word.” But now that’s as far as we can go by theology. That’s as far as we can go by our mind.
       But revelation carries us beyond that. Is that right? [“Amen.”] 171 Now, if you’re teaching
       something on theology, you think, “‘In the beginning was the Word,’ that was God. ‘And the
       Word was God,’ that’s right. ‘And this same Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,’ see.
       ‘And, then, God was made flesh. That’s without controversy,’ that’s true. ‘God was made flesh.’
       We believe that.” But, now, before This was Word… 172 What is a word? A word is the
       manifestation of a thought, is expression of a thought. Is that right? [Congregation says,
       “Amen.”—Ed.] Before you say anything, subconsciously you think it before you speak it. Is that
       right? [“Amen.”] 173 So, “In the beginning was the Word,” that’s as far as we can go back, by
       This, by theology. But before the Word was, It was a thought, and a thought was made manifest.
       You see what I mean? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] 174 Now, that’s how that He said.
       First, He thought, and He spoke the Word, and the Word was made manifest. Oh, how infallible
       God is! Notice, every thought, when it’s spoken. 175 When, Jesus, no wonder, when He come off
       of the hill that night, and looked around that tree, for food, there was no there was no food on
       the tree. And He said, “No man eateth from thee.” And He went on, away. And the next day,
       coming back, the tree had withered. God’s mind; the mind, that, in the beginning, that was a
       thought before it was a Word, that expressed Jesus Christ, the same One was expressing that
       Word back again. See? 176 And every Word in the Bible is God’s thoughts laying in seed
       form, that if received into the human being, and spoke by the same thought that materialized
       the Bible, brings the thing to pass. See what I mean? How powerful could the Church be! The
       Bible said, “Let this mind that was in Christ be in you. As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”
       Now, your thoughts, if they become expression! 177 Like, God said, “Let there be a world.”
       Before it could be a word, it had to be a thought. So, God, in the creation, created the world by
       His thought, first, then exp-…spoke it. And the thought, expressed, became material. See what
      
       15
       I mean? 178 Now, if that same Spirit that said, “Let there be Light,” and there was Light; that
       said, “Let there be trees,” and there was trees; and if that same mind that was in Christ, be in
       you, how much could it say, “Let there be no cancer,” and it would be gone; “Let the blind eyes
       be opened,” and it would be so! See? It, it’s your thought. Jesus said, “Verily…” You said,
       “That was Jesus.” 179 But wait a minute. He said, “Have faith in God. For, verily, verily, I say
       unto you, if you shall say to this mountain, ‘Be moved, plucked up and cast into the sea,’ and
       don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that what you say will come to pass, you’ll have whatever
       things thou sayest.” Is that right? “You shall have it. Not Me; you shall have it.” What power
       has been given to the Church! That, now, you can express it by mental conception… 180 But if
       it becomes a real revelation of God, that you see it before it happened, and express it in word
       form, that word takes a hold and becomes material; a thought expressed! Oh, my, how God
       could…See it? Your heart and your mind is so, and filled with God’s Spirit, until your
       thoughts become His thoughts. Amen. There you are. When your mind, and your leading, and
       your guiding, becomes a direct place, or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that’s moving
       your mortal being! Oh, my! 181 What kind of people should we be? If the very Holy Spirit has
       you so embodied, or empowered, that you don’t use your own thoughts, you don’t use your
       own mind, you don’t use your own opinions; but the Holy Spirit has you so built, until your
       thoughts and your being is God’s Spirit expressing Itself through you! What kind of a church
       would we be?
        Aren’t you glad, that he thought of you? (Amen) Ugh! Awe, you say, “I don’t believe he’s
       that great!” I do! I believe he’s that GREAT! I believe he saw me, before I ever come forth from
       my mother’s womb! Do you believe it? (Amen)
        You know, God told one of his prophet’s Jeremiah why “Son before I called you, I called you
       before you was ever in your mother’s womb.” He said, “I called you and I saw you!” God said it,
       hundreds of years, before it ever took place. A little man that was yielded to the spirit. Said these
       great words, “A virgin shall conceive!” He saw her! Your name was Mary!
       Jeremiah 1:5-Reference quote:
       5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I
       sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
        Oh, it’s secure I tell yeah! These gifts we’re the fathers, before he gave them to the son. As I
       said before, before you can give anything away it has to be yours! You never did belong to the
       devil! You always belonged to your heavenly father. Ain’t that wonderful? (Amen)
        In John 17:6 said, “Thine they we’re and thou gavest them me!” Jesus also said in John 17:7,
       “All things that are thine are mine!” Ephesians 1:4 said, God “Hath chosen us in him before the
       foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love”
       Ain’t that wonderful!
       John 17:6-Reference quote:

       John 6:70-Reference quote:
       70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
        2 Thessalonians 2:13 says; “God has from the beginning has chosen us to salvation” We
       didn’t actually, accidently stumble onto our salvation. Jesus said, “Have I not chosen you
       twelve?”, Haven’t I? Yes, Lord you’ve chosen us twelve” “But one of you is a devil.” Did he say
       it?
       John 6:70-Reference quote:
       70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
       (Amen) Jesus said, “Have I not chosen you twelve?” Well yes, Lord you’ve chosen us twelve!
       “Well, one of you is the devil!” Oh, things begin to get stirred up then, didn’t they? Then one of
       the disciples said, “I must be the devil?” James said, “No it’s me, it ain’t you Peter!” John said,
       “No, it ain’t you James! Peter said, it’s me, I’m just good for nothing!” Judas, he never said
       nothing! (Brother Lambert chuckles And Congregation laughs)
        There’s one thing about a child of the devil, he’s not gonna believe it, even if you tell him!
       You believe that? (Amen) He ain’t gonna believe it.
        Jesus said, “Haven’t I chosen you twelve AND ONE OF YOU IS THE DEVIL!” Jesus said
       this because, there ain’t no man had to tell him what was in man, he knew man. He had chosen
       them from the beginning. When was the beginning? The Bible said, In the beginning was the
       WORD! With Elohim, the Great spirit of God, became the word, THEN THE WORD BECAME
       CHRIST! And Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. To be our redeemer our
       Savior!

       64-0705 - The Masterpiece
       William Marrion Branham
       65 Now the foundations is laid, through faith, love, grace, and to perfection, through the
       patriarchs. 66 Now the body work that come on to this great masterpiece was the prophets,
       which was the Word. I hope you can read it. See? The prophets; not the laws! The prophets, for
       the prophets was the vindicated Word which makes the body; not the patriarchs. The prophets,
      
       17
       they were the Word. 67 Finally, as He started way back in the days of Moses and come down
       through the prophets, to each one. And, finally, building up the body, coming closer all the
       time. And the greatest of all of them was John. The Bible said so. Jesus said it. “There is not a
       man, ever born of a woman, as great as John the Baptist,” for he was the one that could
       introduce the Word. 68 And then come, finally, the great Head, the Head of all of it. The rest of
       the body just spoke of It. The foundation was laid by the patriarch; but the body was built by the
       Word, which was the prophets; and here comes the Head of all of it, Jesus came on the scene.
       There, when this Head piece was put upon it, we find in Him the entire handiwork of God. We
       find in Him the perfect reflection of the Word, for He was the Word, the fullness of the Word.
       Now, again, God has the perfect Masterpiece again. As Isaiah said, “Behold My Servant, My
       Masterpiece, that I have portrayed through all the ages of this perfect One coming. And here
       He stands right before Me, a perfect!” There, in His Own image, reflecting God! For He said,
       in Saint John 14, “When you see Me, you see the Father.” 69 And, then, “In the beginning was
       the Word, and the Word was with God,” and the Word was hewed out and reflected what the
       Word was at the beginning. Him, the Word, reflected in the Masterpiece in His Own likeness,
       God back again in His Own likeness, the Word form being reflected in the image of a man, the
       Masterpiece. 70 All the prophets had flaws; all the ones was a portion. But here, at last,
       coming up through that, finally comes the Masterpiece, the perfect One, no fault in Him at all,
       so perfect reflected of the Builder Himself, His Own image was reflected in His work. “God
       and Christ were One,” insomuch until He put His Own Spirit into Him, and then even the
       image and the Builder became One. God and His sculpture work, His Masterpiece! Where
       Mose—Moses was, in the work of Saint Angelo, was a…or Michelangelo, rather; was a—a
       sculpture work that was dead, because it been made out of stone. But here, the Master Builder,
       when He got His handiwork perfected, He stepped into It. 71 So perfected a Redeemer of man,
       so perfect, so godly; yet, there was no beauty we should desire Him. When this virgin-born Son
       of the living God become so perfect, and humble, and in the image of God, until the great Master
       Who had brought His Life up through the prophets…And He was the fulfilling of all the
       prophets. He was so perfect, until, God seeing this, He smote Him and has cried out, “Speak!”
       as Michelangelo did. “Speak!” You say, “Is that so?” 72 Saint Mark 9:7, we find, upon the
       Mount Transfiguration, when there stood Moses, the law, there stood Elijah, the prophets. All
       the way back from the patriarchs, the fathers, the law, the prophets, and all of them standing
       there. We hear a Voice coming down from the cloud, and said, “This is My beloved Son; hear
       ye Him!” And if they’re going to hear, He’s got to speak. It was just a few days before He was
       smitten. “This is My Son, Who I’m pleased to dwell in. I have molded Him. I’ve been four
       thousand years bringing Him to this. And now, He is so perfect, I’ve got to smite Him so He
       can speak. Hear ye Him! He is the perfected One. He, He is the Masterpiece.” 73 Remember,
       He was portrayed all times, back through the Old Testament. We find Him being the Rock in the
       wilderness, that was smitten, Rock in the wilderness. “I am that Rock that was in the
       wilderness.” But that was a stone that had not come to its perfection yet. But in type form It
       followed the church, to draw from It that that He could draw, give Life to those who He could
       give Life to. But He was that Rock in the wilderness. He had not been made man yet. He was
       only in type. 74 Moses saw Him standing on this Rock. He saw Him pass by, and he said, “It’s
       the back part of a man.” You see, the Sculptor was presenting to Moses, which was a potential
       image of Christ, what the great Masterpiece would look like when It was perfected. He passed
       His…He injected, or—or projected to Moses the vision of what the Masterpiece was going to
       look like. It was the back part of a man, when It passed by in the wilderness. 75 Remember,
      
       18
       Angelo could only cry out and smite the image, and say, “Speak!” But how different it was to
       God, the great Sculptor. When He made a man in His Own image, so perfect that It reflected
       Him, God spoke through the image of man, showing what He would do. He spoke through the
       prophets as they were in their potential image, as He was bringing it up to the Head. But when
       He come in the Head, He was all the image of God; He was portraying Himself. Then, smitten
       for us, now He is the Masterpiece to us, the Gift of God, Jesus Christ, Eternal Life. I hope we
       never forget that. 76 As we see the days darkening, as we see the shadows falling! When, I
       predict, “It’s just a few more turns of the sun. This nation is gone.” Do you know…

       56-0603 - The Lamb's Book Of Life
       William Marrion Branham
       159 That’s the Bible. It said, “Your names was written in the Lamb’s Book of Life before the
       foundation of the world.” Oh, my! The same time that Christ…that God said Christ would be
       slain, He wrote your name with His. Hallelujah! There you are. Your name was written in…
       160 He said, “And he deceived all, great, small,” so many were church members, pretended
       Christians. “He deceived all whose names were not written,” not in the church book, but, “in the
       Lamb’s Book of Life” (when?) “before the foundation of the world.” God wrote your name in
       the Lamb’s Book of Life, by His spoken Word. And sent Christ, the Sacrifice, to buy it, to
       redeem that same group that He had wrote their names in the Lamb’s Book of Life before the
       foundation of the world. [Blank spot on tape—Ed.] 161 Now, “Those who He has called, He
       has justified.” He called them before the foundation of the world. “Those who He called, He
       has justified. And those who He has justified, He hath already glorified.” The same God, that
       before the foundation of the world, called your name and wrote it on the Lamb’s Book of Life;
       in the Book, from the foundation of the world, has already made a place in Glory for you.
       “And when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting for us there in
       Glory…?…” There you are. That’s the Gospel. 162 What are we worried about? Why do we go
       along looking like this, “Well, I just wonder”? 163 Lift up your heads! The Bible said, “Lift up
       the feeble knees. And let the hands raise up, that once hung down. Let him that’s weak, say, ‘I’m
       strong.’” Amen. 164 For, the Gospel is delivered. It’s good News. And, this morning, the Holy
       Spirit, through the Word, is bringing you the good News, that, “From before the foundation of
       the world God wrote your name in the Lamb’s Book of Life.” All the devils out of hell can’t
       erase it out of there. God’s Word has done spoke it. Just as sure to happen, as God wrote it in
       there before the foundation of the world! Amen. How glorious our Heavenly Father is, in His
       infinite love and His mercy, to do that for us! 165 Said, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
       Heavenly Father is perfect.” How can you be? When, it’s not my perfection, it’s not your
       perfection. It’s His perfection, of His Word; that He chose you, and you never chose Him. And
       He brought you into Christ. And you are secured with Jesus Christ, and just as perfect as
       Christ was before God. For, you’re not standing with your own. You’re standing in Him, with
       one thing, “I believe God.” Amen. Oh, I love Him! Oh, my! 166 On the other side of Eden,
       amen, what a wonderful time it’ll be someday, when you look back down and say, “Why did I
       fear? Look at the joy I missed.”
       
        Now I have to watch, this is hard! (Brother Lambert, hits pulpit with his hand) I keep hitting
       that and go home with bruised knuckles. It’s hard to hold your hands down and stand still! When
      
       19
       you get to thinking about this kind of security, it makes you want to jump flat footed over the
       pulpit and run around! Sometimes, I literally think I could run through the cinder blocks. Of
       course, I know I couldn’t! But I still feel like it sometimes, it makes you feel so good!
        TO THINK THAT GOD HAS CHOSE MY SECURITY IN CHRIST! THAT I CAN NEVER
       DIE! I CAN NEVER SEE DEATH! I’LL LIVE FOR ETERNITY! BECAUSE HE DIED FOR
       ME! My that ought to make us so happy!
        There is no man that can give anything away, if it isn’t his first. So we belong to God, we
       belong to Elohim the spirit first. Oh, I’ll show you how secure it is.
        This great Elohim spirit, the Bible said, “God is spirit.” No man has seen God at any time
       because he was a spirit. You can’t see the wind, can you? But you can feel it blow on you, can’t
       you? You know it’s the wind, but you can’t see it! You can’t tell which way it comes by either,
       or which way it went. But’s it’s still a spirit isn’t it. God is a spirit! You may not understand
       about God, you may not know too much about God, but you know there is a God! And you don’t
       know where he come from either!
        The Bible said, “That this Melchisdec, who was the priest of the most high God. Which was
       the king of Jerusalem the king of Salem. Said, he was without a father and was without a mother,

       65-0221E - Who Is This Melchisedec?
       William Marrion Branham
       When you leave here, you’re not dead. You’ve got to come back, even if you’re a sinner, and be
       judged according to the deeds done in the body. “If this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, we have
       one waiting.” En morphe, that’s the word. 64 Now, God, in this stage of…It’s this stage of His
       creation, later formed into flesh, Jesus. From what? From the great beginning, Spirit, then came
       down to be the Word, bringing Itself out. The Word doesn’t yet make Itself, it’s just spoke out, en
       morphe, later He becomes flesh, Jesus, mortal, to taste death for all of us sinners. 65 When
       Abraham met Him, He was Melchisedec. He unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the
       final end, every son of Abraham. Every son of the Faith will absolutely do the same thing. But
       I want to watch how we have to come. 66 Also, we see Him revealed here in Ruth and—and
       Boaz, as a Kinsman Redeemer, how He had to come to be flesh. 67 Now we see the attribute,
       sons of His Spirit, have not yet entered into the Word-form body. But, a theophany; this body
       is subject to the Word and earnest, waiting for the earnest, change of the body. 68 Now, the
       different between Him and you, as a son. See, He was, at the beginning, the Word, an en morphe
       body. He came in and lived in that, in the Person of Melchisedec. Then, later, we never heard no
       more of Melchisedec, because He became Jesus Christ. Melchisedec was the Priest, but He
       became Jesus Christ. Now, you bypassed that. Because, in that form, He knowed all things, and
       you have never been able to know that yet. You come like Adam, like me, you became from the
       attribute to the flesh, to be tempted. But when this life is finished here, “If this earthly tabernacle
       be dissolved, we have one already waiting.” That’s where we go; that is the Word. Then we can
      
       20
       look back and see what we done. Now we don’t understand it. We have never become the Word;
       we’ve just become the flesh-man, not the Word. 69 But, and look, clearly makes it clear, you will
       never be the Word unless you was a thought at the beginning. That proves the predestination
       of God. See? You can’t be the Word unless you’re a thought. You had to be in the thinking,
       first. But, you see, in order to stand temptation, you had to bypass the theophany. You had to
       come down here in flesh, to be tempted by sin. And then, if you stand, “All the Father hath
       given Me will come to Me, and I’ll raise him up at the last days.” See, you had to be first. 70
       And then, you see, He come right down, the regular line, from attribute to…Before the
       foundation of the world, his name is put on the Lamb’s Book of Life. Then, from that, He become
       the Word, the theophany, that could appear, disappear. And then He become flesh and returned
       back again, resurrected that same body in a glorified condition. But you bypassed the theophany
       and become flesh-man, to be tempted by sin. And then, “If this earthly tabernacle is dissolved,
       we have one already waiting.” We have not yet the bodies. 71 But, look! When this body
       receives the Spirit of God, the immortal Life inside of you, it throws this body in subjection to
       God. Hallelujah! “He that’s born of God doth not commit sin; he cannot sin.” Romans 8:1,
       “There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus; they walk not after
       the flesh, but after the Spirit.” There you are. See, that throws your body subject. You don’t
       have to say, “Oh, if I could just quit drinking! If I could just…” Just get in Christ, and it’s all
       gone, see, see, because your body is subject to the Spirit. It’s no more subject to the things of the
       world; they’re dead. They are dead; your sins are buried in baptism, and you are a new creation
       in Christ. And your body, becoming subject to the Spirit, try to live a right kind of life.
        Because…Ohhh… I’m about ready to preach about the God-Head, in just a minute! How

        I always think of the great man Billy Gram great man, great speaker. I asked him, “I said Dr.
       Gram what do you think about the God-head, is there three persons in the God-head?” Dr. Gram
       said, “That hasn’t been revealed yet, that’s a mystery.” He said, “That will never be revealed,
       that’s a mystery.” I wish he’s go back and read the words of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ said, “IT
       IS GIVIN UNTO YOU TO KNOW THIS MYSTERY ABOUT GOD”

       I’ll take your pastor right away from you and move him out of his place; I’ll put him somewhere
       else where his…where I’ll reflect My Light that’ll shine.” Hmm! Wasn’t that solemn? 141 It’s
       time for the churches to repent. It’s time for Pentecost to get a lot of these little polished
       scholars out of the pulpits, and get the old-fashioned preacher in there that’ll tell you the
       Truth; not pat around and use the church for a meal ticket, big wages, and something like
       that, and psychology, and a few horse races, and soup suppers, and everything else. It’s time to
       get back to the Gospel. I don’t care how little you are, “Where two or three are gathered, I’ll—
       I’ll be in their midst.” 142 “Repent, unless I come and remove the candlestick; send him away,

       forty years of training; a stinking Egyptian laying there, rotten and dead. 143 That’s about the

       a stinking bunch of church members that knows no more about God than a Hottentot would
       know about Egyptian night. Right. That, would tell them about the Word of God, they say, “I

       awful thing to have to point back to, for all the strains and struggles and everything we got. 144
       Maybe we could point to a big school, but it’s dead. We could point to an organization, but it’s

       Remember, that’s our confidence. God made a way for man to worship Him under the shed

       56-0916 - Azusa Jubilee
       William Marrion Branham
       17 What we need today, ministers, what we need today, brothers and sisters, is this one thing:
       The devil has got into our church and got us all formal, indifferent. What we need is a calling
       back. What we need is an old fashion gathering together again, the sounding of the Jubilee,
       the pouring forth of the Holy Ghost, the out coming of the Spirit. Amen. Sure, there’s cause to
       come back to the prayer meeting. It’s true, we have just begin to fashion off just like the world,
       do just the same things the world does. How it happened is a lot of Hollywood evangelism, and a
       lot of television, staying home at night watching television, instead of going to prayer meeting,
       watching “Who Loves Lucy” and all that kind of stuff, and staying away from the Word of God,
       and away from the church. And I tell you brother, that’s the reason. You know that’s the truth.
       God help us today to come back to the old fashion Pentecostal experience of the Baptism of
       the Holy Ghost. 18 And a lot of that’s ’cause the—the pastor let down the bars too; that’s
       exactly right laity. Yes, sir. What we need today is a culling out, calling out, pulling out jubilee,
       old fashion revival, is what we need. That is true. Sinners weeping their way through to
       Calvary… Here some time ago a member of a certain big church, certain denominational
       Pentecostal, the man wanted to come into a fellowship of the church and didn’t want to do it
       public, and the deacons took him into the fellowship behind the curtains. What he ought to be
       done is kicked out behind the curtains to the altar, is what we need today to call back a real
       Pentecostal experience. We need it again. We don’t need a new Angelus Temple. We don’t need
       new churches. We got some of the finest churches that stands on soil today. We don’t need a new
       Angelus Temple. The thing we need is a revival in the Angelus Temple. What we need today is a
       revival in Pentecost. 19 We don’t need a new Pentecostal denomination. No, sir, God forbid. We
       don’t need a new denomination, but we need to revive what we’ve already denominated. That’s
       exactly what we need, is a good old fashion revival. God knows that that’s true. Then you’ll
      
       30
       see the powers of God move down one more time. And there’ll be a sound of the mulberry
       bushes, as the Holy Spirit moves before Spirit filled messages and Spirit filled people as they
       go to the world to preach the Gospel. We’re indeed grateful for what He has done. We’re
       thankful for all these things. But, brother, sister, what I mean today, we need a rededication. We
       need a re-pouring out. And what a beautiful time it would be this afternoon, when thousands of
       people are gathered here in this beautiful temple… And how that if we would rededicate our
       lives again and purpose in our heart that we’re going home, wash our face, clean up, and not
       only our face, but our souls, and not in Los Angeles water but in the Blood of the Lord Jesus
       Christ and the power of God, and start a new life over again. That’s what we need today,
       washed in the Blood of the Lamb. Yes, sir.
        When that ole boycott rolls around, you’ll see a real Bride! When the persecution arises, the
       Bride will rise in the height of its power. Even so Lord, do it quickly! Do you want to see it?
       (Amen) Awe… We don’t want to go on like this.
        Wickedness prevailing on every hand. Because man multiplied upon the face
       of the earth.
        But there is gonna be a chosen people, a peculiar people which are gonna to be his body.
       Which will be his church.
       There’s only one God! There’s only one church! There’s only one way into that church-body!
       Only one way!
        The Bible said, “There is A way, that’s evil spoken of” And when you find the way that’s evil
       spoken of, you’ll find the way to the body. No other way! There’s no other way to be saved.
       2 Peter 2:2-Reference quote;
       2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil
       spoken of.
        These chosen ones make up his body, these chosen ones from the foundation of the world, in
       this dispensation of the fullness of time. Is gonna make up his body which will be his church, of
       which Jesus Christ Loves. Head Stone, Capstone, will be the head of that body.
        And we’ve not seen this church. That’s why you’ve been confused. You thought it was the
       Baptist awhile, you left there. Then you thought it was the Methodist, then you left there. Then
       you thought it was the Pentecostal’s, then you left there. Then you went home and sat down and
       started watching television and give up, because you couldn’t find the body.
        There is gonna be a body! There is gonna be a Bride! And there’s gonna be a uniting of a
       marriage. For the marriage of the Lamb has come and the Bride has made herself ready.

       63-0818 - The Uniting Time And Sign
       William Marrion Branham
       89 Notice, they’re right now uniting. You say, “Brother Branham, is that true?” They’re coming
       to the Battle of Armageddon; exactly what they will do. See? And they’re uniting for that right
       now. That’s why we got the U.N. and everything we have. The Western World’s uniting against
       the Eastern World, communism and so forth, it’s all uniting together. The churches are uniting
       together. Everything seems to be uniting. Uniting, uniting themselves together, we see that. 90
       Also, while all this uniting of the nation, these signs, national signs, we see out here in the world,
       earthquakes in divers places, different things uniting; bringing the world together, bringing the
       people together, all the churches together, all these things. And while all this uniting’s been
       going on, there is another uniting going on. Amen! That’s what I want to point to you now. 91
       God is uniting His Bride. She is coming together, from the East and the West, and the North
       and South. There is a uniting time, and that’s on right now. What is She uniting for? The
       Rapture. Amen! God’s getting Her ready. Yes sir, uniting! What is She uniting with? With the
       Word! “For all heavens and earth will pass away, but My Word shall never pass away.” She’s
       uniting Herself with THUS SAITH THE LORD regardless of what any denomination or
       anybody else says. She’s uniting Herself. She’s getting ready. Why? She is the Bride. That’s
       right. And She’s uniting Herself with Her Bridegroom, see, and the Bridegroom is the Word.
       “In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the
       Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” 92 And the Church and the Bride and the Word is
       becoming so one, until the very Word Itself is working out the works of the Bridegroom.
       Amen! You see it? A uniting! Not no more, “Join the church”; not more of this, but flee from
       everything and tied to Jesus Christ. See? It’s the uniting time. God, uniting His Bride together,
       bringing It back; just exactly. Uniting the Words of His promise. 93 Second Thessalonians, 2nd
       chapter; It says, this 5th chapter says, “The saints that are asleep in the dust of the earth will
       waken. And then we will unite with them (the living ones, with the ones that’s been dead), will
       unite before we even get up There,” ’cause the Bride will be complete when She gets There.
       The ones that’s living, that’s uniting themself with the Word, and those that are gone already
       did that; and It all comes together, make one great union of the uniting before going up
       There. Amen! 94 Communism has to rise, these other things has to rise, and the church has to
       unite itself out yonder, when those…and the nations out there for the World Council of
       Churches; and the Bride has to unite Itself under the Word of God. In order to do that, God
       has sent down the Heavenly sign and things, that prove to the Church, as He has to the nation.
      
       32
       Amen. 95 God; uniting time! Yes, sir. Oh, my! Now, you remember, now, there is a uniting of
       the Word (uniting back again), bringing back “the Faith that was once delivered to the
       saints.” Bringing back! That this could only be done in this day. The only time it could be done
       is right now. It never was attacked anywhere else; they went off on denominational sprees. But
       now, it don’t belong to no denominational spree, because it’s time for the uniting of men and
       women of every race, every color, every creed, everything under Christ by the Baptism of the
       Holy Spirit and back to the Word. 96 Uniting time for the Church! Oh, my! Uniting every Word
       that’s been scattered all abroad by these organizations: ever since at Nicaea, Rome, when they
       organized the first church, and they’ve organized Luther, they organized Wesley, they organized
       all the rest of the churches. And doing that, they had to adopt a creed, and then when God sent
       something else, they could not receive It. Therefore, it was not possible until now. And God
       promised, in the last days, that “the Faith of the fathers would be restored back to the Bride
       again,” that it would be this way, and it couldn’t be no other time but this time. Look what a
       sign from Heaven, as a Pillar of Fire hanging among us, and with signs and wonders of the Lord
       Jesus Christ. And while He speaks to us, It never fails to be perfectly on the dot. Amen! Then we
       see where we’re standing. Uniting time! 97 We see nations uniting, we see the world uniting, we
       see communism uniting, we see the churches uniting; and we see God uniting Hisself with His
       Bride, until He and the Church is the same thing. Hallelujah! Like the pyramid there. Right!
       Uniting themselves together; God uniting! Why? Never before, since the early church age,
       was the Pillar of Fire ever among the people. Never before, since the early church age, did
       they ever see the things that we are seeing today. And this was only made possible when God
       sent the Seven Seals and give us a sign by It, and sent seven Angels down out of Heaven; and
       come to bring back that scattered Word in them denominations, and tie it back into the Word of
       God again, to bring down His Holy Spirit.

       1 Kings 22- Reference to story:
        And you know what, they got together and they had a bunch of preachers again about four
       hundred again. And they all said, “Yes sir, yes sir Jehoshaphat you’ll go right up Ahab you’ll go
       right up Jehoshaphat, God’s has givin you the land, you’ll just slay the Syrians just left and right.
       God’s with you!” And four hundred said, “Yeah that’s thus saith the Lord.” They was all in
       unity. And Jehoshaphat said, “I don’t know Ahab, seems to me like, I don’t know down in here
       just something just tells me, somethings wrong. I don’t know whether if those preachers are right
       or not.” WHAT! WHY, YOU MEAN ALL THESE PREACHERS HERE! YOU MEAN TO
       TELL ME, THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG? They’re all saying the same thing! Why
       Never, why let’s go up and smite the Syrians, right now! He said, “Well, couldn’t you just find
       one more? If we just get one more man, maybe it would satisfy me.” He said, “There’s only one
       more, there’s only one. He said, “Well, who is it?” He said, “Well, it’s Micaiah!” He said, “But
       I’ll tell you one thing now, and before you get him down here…I’ll tell you right now, when he
       gets down here now, he’s gonna talk about me. He don’t like me! And when he gets down here,
       he ain’t gonna say what my other preachers here are saying. He’s just gonna be different, then
      
       34
       everybody else! He thinks he’s right AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS WRONG! He said, I know it
       but, if you want me to go to war with you, go get him, I want to hear that preacher! If he’s as bad
       as everybody talks about him, I just got to hear him one time.” Oh, my! Here they sent a little
       group up to get him. Poor little fella, he didn’t have no fellowship, up there all alone with a little
       hand full of people, you know. He went up there and said, “Well, you finally made it, they want
       you to come down and just tell them your side of the revelation. They finally wanted you to
       come down and tell your side. But now listen! We finally got unity after all this time, we got
       unity and we can go up and take this thing. And we just want you to come down and say just
       what the rest of the preachers said and we can all just dwell at peace. Well Micaiah said, “Surely
       I’ll say just what the Lord puts in my mouth. If I got the word of the Lord, I’ll say the word of
       the Lord. I’ll only say the word of the Lord! I’m made up that way, I just got to say what God
       said.” They said, “Now we ain’t got nothing against you brother, you’ve been a nice brother.
       You’re a nice fella they said. But now be sure and say what all the others are sayin, don’t get up
       there and preach the…You Know! Get up there and say everything is all right! We got this thing,

       other ministers and be popular like all the rest of us. You’ll be able to drive a better car and this
       and that, all this.” Micaiah said, “Well I’ll sure say what the Lord said.”
        You know, I bet that was a Memorial Day! You know I guess the pressure built up with that
       little feller. He come walking in the meeting. I can imagine, you couldn’t hear a pin drop, when
       he walked up there behind the…!
       Meaning southern slang: “Pin-Drop Silence”:
       It literally means that silence which is so extreme that even the dropping of a pin can be heard
       which is practically impossible to make out. otherwise in a noisy atmosphere. Methaphorically
       it means to have absolute silence and the phrase is mainly used to mean this only.
       Ahab had him, he forced a smile you know. Micaiah said, “How do you do Brother Ahab.” But
       you know, there’s one thing about that preacher, when he went up there, he knew what the
       prophet had said before him. He knew what the prophet had said before him! See, that made the
       difference. He knew that his revelation was right! Because it lined up with what the prophet had
       said! And when he got up there he said, “I’d like for you’ll to go right ahead, you all just go
       ahead with your meeting and you preachers go on and preach. And if the Lord give me
       something to say, I’ll say it.”
        And they all got up and preached you know. Oh, it was a wonderful thing, wonderful
       meeting. And then it come his turn to preach, and all of them just had to have him say what they
       said. He said, “Brethren that’s wonderful! Real admirable! He said, “You’ll just go on up! No
       use for me to express what I think about it! You’ll are in unity and I don’t want to cause no
       trouble, just go on up! Sure, just go on up! You got this thing, you’ll are just ready to go, go on
       up! Ahab said, “Oh my, that’s the first time he’s ever agreed with us since Elijah’s been gone.
       He never has agreed with what we’ve been preaching. Boy’s there’s something wrong here! And
       one of ole Ahab’s preachers that was the head of the meeting, got so stirred up and said sternly,
       “I adjure you to tell the truth!” He said, “Oh if you want the truth, My! Let me tell you about it!”
       He said, “I SAW THE CHURCH SCATTERED LIKE A SHEEP WITHOUT A SHEPHERD.”
       And boy, it shocked the preachers so bad one, one of the most popular preachers went over and
       popped him in right in the face and said, “Now where did the spirit of God go after it come off of
       me!” He turned around and said, “You’ll find out.”

       one over here something different. Then God’s a God of confusion. There’s only one revelation,
       only one.
        Now, look here! I’m trying to close here in just a minute.
       Notice here, that only this selected group that’s chosen before the foundation of the world, and
       they are gonna be on earth in this end-time. A selected number of them, are gonna be born on
       earth at this end-time, when God is gonna do a great mighty thing! See! And they will come
       together in one faith! One mind! In one unity! In one revelation! And they’ll make up the body
       the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. Do you believe that? (Amen)
        And all those whom the father has givin to the Lord Jesus, shall come to him. Even though
       they be scattered all over in different places, yet in this end-time they will be drawn together.
       Something is gonna happen upon earth as Ephesians 1:10 said that he’s gonna gather them all
       together, that they might have one Faith, one Lord and one Baptism to be baptized into. And they
       will make up the body of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. Which Christ will be the head. Is
       that the Bible? (Amen) All right! See!
       Ephesians 1:10-Reference quote:
       10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in
       Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:
        All of these that the father has givin unto the Lord Jesus Christ shall come to him! See! And
       those that come, they will not be cast out they’ll be excepted. And they will come by God’s
       provided way.
       John 6:37-Reference quote:
       37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise
       cast out.
        Now look! You say, “Well, oh Lord, what if a preacher don’t go down…Let me tell you
       something! All of those that’s to be born in the end-time, that’s to hear his voice…Jesus said,
       “My sheep know my voice and another they won’t follow. See! There’s not a one of them that
       can be lost. I don’t care if he’s in Hong Kong China or down in India, way down in Africa. See
       there’s no difference. All will come to Jesus without exception, see! Now notice here! All that
       cometh to me. All will come to me!
        Notice here! Here in this has disproves this false doctrine and their argument of a backslider.
       “He was saved, then he was backslidden then he was lost”
        I heard one great Evangelist with a tent and a great crowd of people…I was just a babe in the
       Lord. I was sitting there seeking the Lord myself for a tent. And then when he gave it to him, I
       saw the word of God I said, “No Lord, I’ll just go over here and wait. I didn’t really mean it. I
       don’t want it.” I was sitting there praying for a tent, and there was a real great big crowd and they
      
       36
       we’re healing the sick and all this, you know. He got up and called one preacher out, and said,
       “Your backslidden” The man started crying. He said, “Your backslidden” Then he went on and
       he said, “Now the Lord just saved you again tonight!” All the people just cried and praised the
       God.
        I said, “My God my Lord!” I said, “Lord how can it be, this man out here in this tent. I said
       now if I’d get up there and preach the truth” I said, “There wouldn’t be two left here in this tent.”
       I said, “Here he’s majoring on a gift” And you can never major on a gift, that’s a minor. You can
       major on a minor. The major thing, is the Word! I would rather have the giver than the gift. I
       would rather have the shoe then the tongue. See a lot of people want a tongue today. You can get
       a tongue, but you can get it without the shoe. What I would rather have, I’d rather have the giver
       of the gift and the shoe and the tongue. You get the giver, you get the tongue and everything.

       58-0928M - The Baptism Of The Holy Spirit
       William Marrion Branham
       58 When was your name put in the Book of Life? As I said last night, the man that wrote the
       song, “There’s a new name written down in Glory, and it’s mine, it’s mine,” meaningly he was
       right, but Scripturally he was wrong. Your name was not written the night you come to Christ.
       Jesus said, “All the Father has given Me will come to Me. And no man can come except My
       Father draws him. All that comes to Me, I’ll give them Eternal Life, and raise him up at the
       last day. There’s none of them lost. I loose nothing, ’cause no man can pluck them out of My
       Father’s hand, Who gave them to Me.” Oh, my! Whew! Saint John 5:24, “He that heareth My
       Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, has Eternal Life, and shall never come to the
       judgment, but has passed from death unto Life.” That’s why this church believes in the security
       of the perseverance of the saints, not in the Baptist form, not in the Presbyterian form, but in the
       Bible form. 59 “Well,” you say, “now, Brother Branham, I guess once in grace always in
       grace.” That brings a lot of disgrace. But when a man or a woman has been born of the Spirit
       of God, old things have passed away, all things have become new, and he’s been birthed and
       blessed by the Eternal God. And they can no more perish than God Himself can perish. 60 Do
       you mean to tell me that a God, the infinite God, would come down and give you Eternal Life,
       knowing that He was going to lose you? Save you here, knowing He’s going to lose you there?
       What did He save you for? Why, He’s working against Himself. If He saved you once, you are
       saved for all Eternity. There’s no demons in hell could upset you. 61 Now, the infinite God Who
       could tell the end from the beginning, and then save you here, this week, and knowing next
       year you’re going to backslide, and lose you? Well, what’s He doing a work like that for? That
       would be foolish; I wouldn’t do that. If I made you my friend today, knowing you was going to
       be my enemy tomorrow, well, I wouldn’t do it. I’d just let you alone. See? God makes you His
       servant, today, because He knows, and knowed before you ever come on the earth. When He was
       making the calcium that went in your body, when He created the cosmic light that you…that’s in
       you. When the petroleums and all that you’re made up of, when God created it on the earth, He
       knew every fiber of you and what you’d do. How can the infinite God… 62 “Well, I better walk
       careful today; I might backslide and be lost tomorrow.” You wasn’t saved at the beginning.
       You might be worked up, under emotions. You might just think you’re saved. You might feel like
       you’re saved. You might believe that you’re saved. You might join the church. You might be a
       good Baptist, Methodist, or Pentecostal. That don’t have one thing to do with it. Your name’s
      
       37
       ever…If you are ever saved, you were saved before the world ever began, when God sent
       Jesus, in His mind, to save that one who He saw was savable. Now, He’s not willing that any
       should perish. He’s not willing, but, if He’s God, He knowed who would and who would not.
       The Scripture says so. So there you are.

       65-1126 - Works Is Faith Expressed
       William Marrion Branham
       02 Now, a gift, just like I said last night, “A gift is wonderful, but you can’t base your Eternal
       destination on gifts.” You cannot major on a minor, and a—a gift is a minor. And Satan can
       impersonate any gift God’s got, he can make something just exactly like it, see, exactly.
       Therefore, we got to watch that. 103 Like sometimes I express about shouting; I’ve seen demons
       shout. Um-hum. Speak in tongues, I’ve seen demons speak in tongues. Sure, he impersonates It.
       It isn’t a genuine, but it impersonates It, you see, makes it look like it’s real. And people
       sometime, who don’t know the difference, declare this to be “real” when it isn’t real. 104 And
       the same thing they do about Divine healing. They think, “Well, it’s a hocus-pocus, or something
       like that.” It isn’t. It’s a genuine, unadulterated faith in what God said to be the Truth. And that
       anchors! And when it anchors, there’s nothing going to move it. It’s going to stay there. And
       therefore, cutting these corners,… 105 Now, faith is “a revelation from God.” Now, faith is a
       revelation. There’s where I want to stay, there, just a moment. It’s a revelation. He has
       revealed it to you by His grace. It’s nothing you did. You didn’t work yourself up into faith.
       You ever have faith, it’s give to you by the grace of God. And God reveals it to you, therefore
       faith is a revelation. And the whole Church of God is built upon the revelation.
       
        Then they would say, “Oh this preacher got saved again tonight!” That shocked me pretty bad
       that a preacher would be out in the public with such a crowd of people of thousands and make a
       statement that a preacher could be saved tonight, and then lost and backslidden and saved again.
        I’d like to say, there’s nothing in the pages, of Gods Bible about any kind of gospel like that.
       Once you are saved, you are eternally saved and you can never be lost, no never. See!
        Jesus said, “All that the father cometh to me, I will in no wise cast him out and I will raise
       him up in the last days.” He said, “All that the father giveth me shall come to me” See! “And the
       father which gave them to me is greater than all. And no man can pluck them out of my father’s
       hand”
        Does that mean that the Lord God is greater than you? Are you able to go back out in the
       world? Are you able to go back out in the world and Waller around like a hog, like a dog to its
       vomit? Now you know if a dog got sick and vomited and he goes and eats that same vomit up
       won’t he get sick again? No, he can’t do it. A child of God can’t go back out in the world and be
       lost after he’s saved. Do you believe that? (Amen)
        Jesus said, “My father which gave these gifts to me, he greater than all!” He said, “No man is
       greater than my father. He gave me these gifts and I ain’t gonna lose a one of them. I ain’t gonna
       lose a one of them. And I am gonna raise them up at the last day.” Do you feel secure? All right!
       None of them is gonna be lost, no not a one. See, not a one!
        This proves the argument that your saved tomorrow…Like this poor little sister got up and
       said when she testified, “Well, I’m fine saved filled with the Holy Ghost and got a mind to go on,
       but just pray for me the devil run me ragged today and I don’t know whether I’m gonna make it
      
       38
       or not and I need all you saint’s prayer. So, please pray for me when you ain’t got nobody else to
       pray for. I don’t know if I can hang on or not” Poor miserable soul.
       I ain’t hanging onto God he’s hanging onto me. Ain’t that miserable? (Amen)
        Oh, you’re up there and you’re just hanging on! Can you imagine? Did you ever hang onto a
       rope? How long can you hang onto a rope suspended in the air? Oh Lord! I don’t think I can
       hang on much longer! Lord if you don’t do something, I’m going back in the world! I can’t stand
       it no more, I just got to have a cigar. Oh Lord! I can’t stand these women going down the street
       in these miniskirts! You better do something right away or I’m a goner. Honey, you ain’t never
       got it yet! You ain’t never got it! Oh Lord, I can’t hardly hang on another minute. Oh, I’m glad I
       ain’t hanging on! I’M GLAD HE’S HANGING ONTO ME!

       58-0500 - The Eagle Stirring Her Nest
       William Marrion Branham
       16 They would get up of a morning, and every who gets up in the morning, gets on my lap first.
       And Rebekah is a little older than Sarah, and so Rebekah got up first, and she run in and jumped
       across my leg. And her leg’s long, hung down to the floor. And she put her arms around me and
       begin to hug me. And just then the smaller girl came into the room. And she looked, and Rebekah
       turned to Sarah and said, “Sarah, I’ve got all of daddy. There’s none left for you.” And the little
       fellow, the little girl puckered up her little lip to cry, and I motioned to her and put my other leg
       out. And she come over and jumped on my knee, and I put my arms around her. Then she turned
       those big brown eyes, and looked over to Rebekah, and said, “Rebekah, you may have all of
       daddy, but daddy’s got all of me.” So that’s the way it is, brother. You may have all the theology
       and all, but I want Christ to have all of me. Everything that I am, every fiber and every bit, I
       want Him to hold me. How that God and—does His great marvelous work.
        He said, “He that has begun a good work in you will perform it to the end!” He’ll keep right
       on performing.
       Philippians 1:6-Reference quote:
       6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it
       until the day of Jesus Christ:
        Oh, if you backslide and you keep growing and growing, more grace more grace more like the
       Lord Jesus every day. Is, that right? (Amen) How many is glad you’re not hanging on now? How
       many believe there’s some supernatural force hanging onto you? (Amen) Yes, that’s good!
        Now this just proves the argument of a backslider. Just give me a few minutes and I’ll close
       now. This just proves the argument of the preachers, of the doctrine of that “Your saved today
       and lost tomorrow. You backslide, come on back renew your faith and be baptized again and do
       you first works and start over again.” Total impossibility, it’s not in the pages of Gods Bible.
       There’s nowhere there’s no scripture in the Bible to support it.
        You say the bible said, Paul said, “After once the Lord saved the people out of Egypt, he after
       destroyed them.” Honey, read it like it is, he said he saved them out of Egypt! He saved them
       out of Egypt! He saved them out of Egypt. They never got salvation yet, they just got saved out
       of Egypt.
      
       39
        But you say, “But brother Lambert, I quit smoking! I loved cigars I gave up cigars!” I quit
       them cigarettes, I loved the whiskey bottle I gave it up!” Well, let me tell you something! If you
       was in your right mind, and in your right thinking you wouldn’t smoke cigars anyway, they’ll
       give you cancer! And whiskey will make you sick and take all your money and make your
       children go without shoes. That ain’t salvation! That ain’t salvation! See, you can have all those
       things, give up all those things that go with the flesh. Cigarettes, smoking, fornication, adultery
       and all those things and be just as lost as lost can be!!! See!

       53-0613 - God's Provided Way
       William Marrion Branham
       Then how can you blame God? You can’t. You—you got to blame yourself. There’s not a bit of
       need of anyone going to hell when God has made a provided way of escape. You can’t help being
       a sinner. You can’t help that. You was borned a sinner. But you can help staying a sinner. For if
       you accept Jesus as your—in your place as… He was made sin for you, God’s way of escape.
       Then you don’t have to be a sinner. You’ll be a Christian and you’ll be holy: not your own
       holiness, but His holiness; not what—what you are but what God has done for you in Christ
       Jesus. See? Your own ways… You can quit lying. You can quit stealing. You can quit smoking.
       That’s… don’t mean you’re saved. No, sir. You’re saved because God ordained that you
       should be saved and called your heart. That’s why you’re saved. “No man can come to the
       Father except by… to Me except My Father draws him.” And God has made a way of escape
       now.

       William Marrion Branham
       53 I said, “Brother, every one of them told you truth…?… every one.” That’s right. I said, “I
       believe you can raise up your hands, accept Christ, get happy and shout, and speaking in
       tongues. All of those things I believe is the truth. But brother, that’s not what you’re after. See,
       you’re after the accepting of Christ.” The accepting of Christ isn’t raising up your hands, or
       these things, it’s accepting a Person into the heart, and then the attributes comes out. First, get
       things first: Christ in the heart and It’ll bear record. I said, “Like smoking, drinking, gambling,
       committing adultery, those things are not sin.” Then I said that one night and a good old
       Methodist mother raised up. I said, “It’s no sin to drink, not sin to smoke, gamble.” She raised
       up, she said, “Then preacher, would you tell me what sin is?” I said, “Unbelief.” That’s right. I
       said, “The reason you drink, smoke, and carry on like that is because you are an unbeliever.
       That’s the attributes of unbelief causes that. If you are a Christian, you don’t do it. And just
       because you quit drinking, smoking, chewing, and—and committing adultery, that doesn’t
       mean you’re a Christian. You can do that yourself.” That’s right. All right.
        But God’s salvation is not of the body…Salvation is not of the body but SALVATION IS OF
       THE SOUL! “But the soul that sinneth, it shall die.”
      
       40
       Ezekiel 18:20-Reference quote:
       20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither
       shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him,
       and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
        God is saving the soul! See! Paul said, “We’re not of them that draw back, we’re they that
       press on to the believing of the soul.”
       Hebrews 10:39-Reference quote:
       39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of
       the soul.
        Fine give up all those things, you ought to do that. But that will never get rid of the original
       sin. And the original sin was, doubting Gods word. See, if you live like the world and act like the
       world, you do that because you don’t take God at his word. You believe God’s word, and it was
       in you, you would be a different man. Your soul has to be saved.
        Now I’ve got to hurry along. Seems like I can’t get it all out. All right this proves the
       argument of backslid. See!
        Oh, I slide back, I back slide all the time! But not like that! See! I get to where I should be
       praying like I ought to. If I ain’t praying like I ought to, I’m kinda backslid. If I’m fervent in
       Prayer and pressing on and got victory in my life and I’m just singing jumping around just like
       little ram. Just singing the psalms and the praises of God and just praying every time I can pass
       by a place and pray, boy I’m in good shape! But then if I get so busy, that I ain’t got time to pray
       then I get backslid. But honey I never got backslid and lost what I got! No sir, it keeps me every
       day, and I’m persuaded it’ll keep me until that day.
        What it mounts to, with the people that God saves out of the world, saved you out of the
       denominations, but you never did get salvation in your soul! See, I have people in here,
       preachers in here that spoke in tongues, prayed for the sick saw gifts operate and everything and
       their soul was just as lost as can be. You say, “How can it be?” It can be!
        The Bible says the rain falls upon the just and the unjust as well. The same rain that falls on
       the wheat, falls upon the tares. True? (Amen) All right!
        Listen here! Now weight this out! If you are to ever be saved, it will be because of God’s
       will! See! It will be because of Gods will, he willed to save you! He willed to save you!
        Now listen to this see! John 6:39 the sixth chapter of John again.
       John 6:36
       39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should
       lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
        Jesus said, “It’s the will of him who sent me! The will of him that sent me, is that I lose
       nothing.” Come on now! He said, “It’s the will of him that sent me, his will is that I lose not one
       of these gifts.” He said, “I’m not gonna lose a one of them”
        Now, I’ve had people tell me and just argue right down to the bare skin of the thing, you
       know. They say, “There ain’t nobody gonna tell me I wasn’t saved and I’m lost now! There ain’t
       nobody gonna tell me I wasn’t saved” Contradicts much of the Bible.
      
       41
        Jesus said, “The will of the father that sent me, his will is that I lose none of these gifts that he
       gives me.” See, it’s his will that I don’t lose any of them.
        Now do you know anybody that can change the will of God? Do you believe prayer will
       change the will of God? God makes one decision and that’s final!

       Now let’s not just be so slothful now, that we’ll… 36 Remember, God never changes His ways.
       He’s…remains, because His Word…He is the Word, and His Word cannot fail. He is infinite.
       Therefore if God makes a decision on something, it must ever remain that way. He can’t go
       back and say, “I was wrong.” See? I can do that; you can do it. But, God can’t, because He’s
       infinite. See? His first decision is Eternal. 37 When God gave man the best fortification He
       could have for His, to bind him in, to close him in, God gave man His Word in the garden of
       Eden, His Word. And Eve made that rashal, final, great…one of the most rashal things she ever
       did, or ever could have done, was to reason with God’s Word. We don’t reason; we just believe
       It. Now, God has never appropriated anything else but believe His Word. That’s right. His
       Word, we must stay behind It.
        His will that sent me, is that I lose none of those gifts. It’s his will that I not lose none of them
       and I’ll raise every one of them up in the last day. That’s eternal security!
        Jesus said in John 15:16, “Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you!” You never did
       chose me, I chose you!
       John 15:16
       16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring
       forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my
       name, he may give it you.
        You say, “Oh I excepted you Lord, I’m giving up this, I’m giving up that Lord! Oh, I have
       forsaken this Lord, look what I’ve done!” And he turns around and tells you, “You never chose
       me, I chose you!”
        It wasn’t Adam saying, “Lord, Lord, where are you, where are you? Lord, I sinned God,
       where are you, where are you?” No sir! He was down there hid behind some bushes. God come

       was God saying, “Adam, where are you?” God said, “Adam where art thou?” Adam said, ‘over
       here behind the bushes Lord”
        What'cha doin behind that denomination? I’m hiding! Now that I heard your Voice, I realized
       that I’m NAKED! WHAT WE NEED IS THE VOICE OF GOD TO THUNDER DOWN
       THROUGH THIS THING AND MAKE THESE DENOMINATIONAL PEOPLE REALIZE
       THAT THEY ARE NAKED!
        You have not chosen me, I have chosen you! He said, “Now that I have chosen you, I have
       ordained you to bring forth fruit, like I did!”
      
       42
        And Saint John 14:12 said, “The works that I do, ye shall do also and greater works then these
       shall ye do!” Because you’re my gifts that the father gifteth me. Now what the father giveth to
       me I give to you, now go ye into all the world and do the same thing I did!
       John 14:12
       12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and
       greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
       Mark 16:15-Reference quote:
       15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
        Now that makes the picture of Christianity different altogether, then what we got out here.
       How many say amen? (Amen) How many all your soul and all your might, want to see the kind
       of Church I’m preaching about here this morning? (Amen) Then there’s got to be one
       somewhere, because it’s the fathers will! And his will can’t be broken!
        Now, I’m coming along! Yea I can make it, through all this.
       God choice in eternity are manifested here on earth, by you believing his word. That’s the only
       true test that I know of that you’re a true child of God, when you prove to him by excepting his
       word. Is, that right? (Amen)
        Listen to the apostle James 1:18 said;
       James 1:18
       18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his
       creatures.
        By his own will! Who? By your will? Well, it was your earthy fathers will, Brother Lamberts
       will that all his children do and be just like he did. Oh, I will that! I really will that! But my
       willing that, will never get it done! Ugh! Nah, we don’t pass on, the life of Jesus Christ to our
       sons and to our daughters. They’ve got to be gifts to Christ before the foundation of the world
       just like you are. You say, “Will all my children be saved?” Yes, if their names are on the
       Lambs-Book of life they’ll all be saved.
        Now this ought to cause us, to really Love the Lord and please the Lord. See, I don’t serve
       Christ to be saved! I’m not serving Christ to be saved! I’m serving Christ because I am saved! Is
       that why your serving him? people don’t serve him to be saved. They serve him because you are
       saved.
        Now listen to this. Of his own will begat he us. By his own will, not your will, not the will of
       the preacher, not the will of the denominations. By Gods own will, begat he us with the word
       of…What? (Truth)
        Now here’s the plan of salvation. The only way that you can be saved, is that it’s the will of
       God. In that it is the will of God for you to be saved, he has a provided way for you to be saved.
       There is only one provided way for you to be saved. And that is, you will hear the word of truth!
       That’s the only way that your soul can be saved, is to receive the truth!

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 10 - A Resume Of The Ages
       William Marrion Branham
       But Jesus will come back and destroy them all with the brightness of His coming. And their end
       will be the lake of fire. But what about the true seed? It will happen just as we have said. The
       people of God are being made ready by the Word of Truth from the messenger to this age. In
       her will be the fulness of Pentecost for the Spirit will bring the people right back to where they
       were at the beginning. That is “Thus saith the Lord.” It is “Thus saith the Lord” for that is
       what Joel 2:23-26 says, “Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for
       He hath given you the former rain moderately, and He will cause to come down for you the rain,
       the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. And the floors shall be full of wheat, and
       the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath
       eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, My great army which I sent
       among you. And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the Name of the Lord your
       God, That hath dealt wondrously with you: and My people shall never be ashamed.” Now it
       says God is going to “restore.”
        It’s not, “Oh, glory to God I felt it, I tell you I felt something. I went down my spine and the
       hair raised up on my neck, I felt something.”
       Jesus never did say, “Did you feel it.” He said, “Did you believe it!” After that you believed the
       word of truth! You we’re sealed with the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.

       William Marrion Branham
       146 Moses standing, up-and-down the street, saying, “The evening message is here! It shall
       come to pass, at the end of the fourteen days, you shall gather the congregation together and kill
       the lamb. The whole congregation of Israel shall kill it, putting their hands upon it, identifying
       themselves with it. And the blood shall be struck upon the post, and upon the lintel of the door,
       and, ‘When I see the blood, I’ll pass over you, for it’s a token that you’ve accepted the death of
       the lamb that I have provided for you.’” The blood was the token. 147 Now the Spirit is the
       Token. “You shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.” And when the Blood was
       shed, the Token was sent down on the Day of Pentecost, like a rushing, mighty wind. 148 That
       was the theme of every apostle. That was, “Have you received the Holy Ghost since you
       believed? Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the
       remission of sins, and you shall receive this gift of the Holy Ghost, for it’s a Token, amen, that
       you’ve passed from death unto Life.” There you are. When that Gen-…Jewish church faded out,
       the Gentiles taken it over, and that perversion like that; now she has come out, to get that
       remnant of the Gentile, for His Name’s sake, the Bride.
        See, it’s his own will, he begat us with the word of truth. Now where’s truth? Truth is with
       the prophet.
        Jesus said through the Apostle Paul said through the inspiration of Jesus Christ, “The word of
       God is of no private interpretation.”
       2 Peter 1:20-Reference quote:
       20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
        Well you say, “Brother Lambert I believe it this way. I believe you wrong, I believe it’s this
       way.” Another one says, “I believe it this way.” You don’t have no right to say that what-soever.
        The word of the Lord, is coming this last day to the prophet. Now from the prophets it passes
       down to the pastor. Now supposing the pastor, don’t say what the prophet said? The pastor ain’t
       really called of God then. All evangelists and pastors and teachers will line up with what the
       prophet said. Because the word of the Lord only comes to one kind of man, the true
       interpretation of God’s word comes to only to one kind of a man and that’s a prophet. Now
      
       45
       anybody knows the scripture, that we’re living in the last day where there is to be prophets to
       come on the scene.

       Father, we see John standing here on earth, and there was the—the Word that he was
       revealing. And the Bible said, “The Word always comes to the prophet.” And the Word was
       flesh then, so It walked right out in the water, to John. The Word came to the prophet.

       60-1204M - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       12 I want you to notice the symbols of Christ, also, in the Bible and here on earth. On the earth,
       He was a Prophet. You believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] A Prophet is the
       Word. We know that. The word prophet means “a divine interpreter of the Word.” The divine
       Word is wrote, and the prophet has the divine Spirit of God within him. And, you know, the
       prophet in the Old Testament was called “god.” How many knew that?
        Well you say, “I don’t want any of them to come!” I do! I wish five hundred would come and
       sweep through this New England over-night. I mean real prophets! The Bible said there was
       many prophets in Antioch.
       Acts 13:1-Reference quote:
       Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas,
       and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought
       up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
        Do you believe in the restoration of the early church? (Amen) Then there’ll be prophet’s there
       then, won’t they. And those prophets will have the truth.
        You know that God has raised up a prophet in this last day by the name of, Brother William
       Branham. We know that he was God’s prophet. And those that thought they had truth, wound up
       to find out they didn’t have any truth. Because Jesus said, over in Amos the prophet said, “God
       will do nothing, except first he sends the prophet. Then when he sends the prophet, there is
       something that God wants to do, he’s gonna do it then after the prophet comes.
       Amos 3:7-Reference quote:
       7 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.
        Now, let me hurry through.
      
       46
       Now let me quote this one more scripture. So, you listen to this tape and go home and read your
       bible. And find out how secure your salvation is.
        2 Timothy 2:19 said, “The foundation of God standeth sure, this foundation of God this
       salvation of God, standeth sure. The Lord knoweth them that are his. The Lord knoweth them
       that are his. When did he know you? Before the foundation of the world, he knew you. Isn’t your
       salvation sure then, if he knew you before the foundation of the world? Now if he knew you
       before the foundation of the world, do think he’ll know you clear to the end of the world? I
       believe so! Are right!
       
       2 Timothy 2:19
       19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them
       that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
        Now watch here in closing! Now the Lord manifest his chosen ones on earth, by saving them
       through the preaching of the truth of God’s word, to the saving of the soul. They are all begotten
       just like the Lord Jesus was. Jesus was begotten by the holy ghost, which is the word of God.
        Did you know the Holy ghost the father, and the word is all the self-same person? The word is
       the holy ghost. Is, that right? The father is the Holy Ghost. And the father is the word. Is, that
       right? (Amen) All right!
        Just the way Jesus was begotten through Mary. That’s how you’re to be saved is through the
       word of truth.
        Now listen, this is wonderful! Now he manifested his chosen ones here on earth, by them
       receiving the revealed word of truth, to the saving of the soul.
        Now watch here! God provides the truth! God provides the servants! God provided the truth
       that he preaches! God provides the holy spirit! Now watch here! It’s the Holy spirit God the
       word, that convinces you that truth is right! It’s God the Holy Ghost, that convinces you the truth
       is right! It’s not only the Holy Ghost that convinces you but convicts you and converts you. The
       Holy Ghost the word of God convicts you that this truth it’s right. Then it convinces you, it
       convicts you and after it convicts you, it converts you. Ain’t that wonderful? (Amen)
        Now notice here, the preacher is provided by God. The truth is provided by God. The Holy
       Ghost is provided to convince you. The Holy Ghost is provided to convict you. The Holy Ghost
       is provided to convert you. What did you do? What did it say in the scriptures, that you do?
       (Nothing)
        And you down there saying, “Lord, Lord I came all this way, Lord I done this, I did this, I
       gave up this, I did that Lord, oh Lord” That’s the way the believer does, only to later to wakes up
       to find out, that he had nothing to do with it. He finds out that he’s not hanging onto God, but it’s
       God hanging onto him, see.
        All right now, God provides it all, the preacher, the truth. He also provided all those little tiny
       circumstances that lead you to hear his truth. Every one of those circumstances! You met this
       person, then you met that person, this sister told you that, this tape come along. This happen to
       you, then you went over here this and that, you heard this and that. You drove down here, over
       there down here. And you wind up there. Cause you done all this? No! It was God! All these
       things was the will of God, leading you.
        The Bible said, “The steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord!” All ordered of the Lord.
       You say, “Lord how could it be?” How could it be, the only way that it could be is that he willed
       it before the foundation of the world. “Oh, Lord! How could I be here, how can I hear all these
      
       47
       great glorious things?” It’s because of his grace. He worked out all these things for you to be
       here, see. It wasn’t you at all. All them things, how you done this, how you managed to get there,
       it’s all provided by God.
       Psalms 37:23-Reference quote:
       23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.
       Psalms 37:39-Reference quote:
       39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time of trouble.
       Proverbs 4:18-Reference quote:
       The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,
       shining brighter and brighter until midday.
        And that’s why the Apostles said, “God would save the world by the foolishness of
       preachers” Plum foolish! Plum foolish to stand here and rave and holler and jump up and down
       and tare around and carry on like this. Plum foolish! Plum foolish! Say it ain’t foolish, it is
       foolish to! You come in here and sit for three hours to hear an ole bald headed, big nose preacher
       carrying on like this. Why God could of done it an easier way! Why, YOU NEVER WAS LOST
       ANYWAY!
       1 Corinthians 1:21-Reference quote:
       21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the
       foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
        But oh, you say you got to have burden for souls. Why absolutely positively! But the only
       reason I can have a burden for souls, is God gives the burden. Oh you say, “Well, preacher I’m
       getting confused!” Well, just wait minute. The Bibles says, “How can they preach…How can
       they? HOW YOU GONNA PREACH, except you be sent” How they gonna believe without a
       preacher? How are they gonna preach, except they be sent?
       Romans 10:15-Reference quote:
       5 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of
       them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
        Of course, now let’s all work together. Why, you can’t even preach unless Gods send you.
       And how’s the people gonna be saved unless the preacher goes forth. And how’s the preacher
       gonna go, unless he’s met God, and he’s called him and gave him the truth!
        Now what happens some denominational seminary-cemetery cranks out those hand-made
       preachers coming out, they don’t come out there and tell you the truth. They come out and tell
       you a lie. And if you believe that lie, you’ll dammed. You’re not begotten through a lie! BUT
       YOUR BEGOTTEN THROUGH THE WORD OF TRUTH! AND THE TRUTH IS WITH
       GODS APOSTLES AND PROPHETS. Amen! Still foolish!
        That’s why all these reporters, all of them come said, “It’s foolish!” About John Wesley or
       one of those great men of God. Five thousand was coming out in the pasture to hear him, you
       know. And he was just preaching, just what would have yeah! Preaching, hell fire and brimstone,
      
       48
       righteousness and holiness. And that great mind that wrote that article in the great paper and said,
       “For my life, I can’t understand why all them thousands of people are coming out to hear that
       guy? And said in the first place he of little stature, he’s ugly as a mud fence. He ain’t got no
       diction, he ain’t no orator. Why, he’s so uneducated, why how can we understand all this?” And
       this man come and showed the article to Wesley and he just sat there and chuckled and laughed!”
       He said, “Of course it’s foolish, why it’s God! It’s all God!”
        God calls the preacher! God sends the Holy Ghost and convicts you and converts you. But I
       tell yeah, many are convicted but few are converted. The Holy Ghost convicts many, but the
       Holy Ghost saves but a few. Oh you say, “Oh I think many will be saved!” I don’t! Do you know
       why I say that? Because of God’s Bible. The Bible said, “Narrow is the way that leadeth to life
       and few there be that find it. But broad is the way that leadeth to hell and destruction and many
       go in there at. Because strait is the way that leadeth to life.”
       Matthew 7:13,14-Reference quote;
       13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to
       destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
       14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that
       find it.
        All right now, let me run here real fast, now here about five minutes. No man can come to
       Christ except he be drawn by the Holy Ghost. Jesus said in John 6:44, “No man can come to me
       except the father draw him first.”
       John 6:44-Reference quote:
       44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him
       up at the last day.
       
        Now watch here! The Holy Ghost which is God, which is the spirit the word the father.
       Right? (Amen) He knows who the gifts are that’s given to Christ! Don’t he? (Amen) If I gave
       you a gift, though it would be wrapped up friend, don’t you know that I know more about that
       gift than you do? You don’t know nothing about it! You inherited it. But then when it’s done
       unwrapped you know. Now the father knows the gifts, don’t he? (Amen) So, no man can come to
       the father, because the father knows that gift. And the Holy Ghost comes down there on that gift
       and over shadows them and convinces them and convicts them and converts them. Ain’t that
       wonderful? (Amen) No Man can come except the father draw him, see.
        See Roman 9:16, “It’s not of him that willeth not of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth
       mercy.” See God’s will!
       Romans 9:16
       6 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
        Man is seeking salvation! Man is seeking! Jesus said, “Seek and ye shall find” Man is seeking
       salvation! That’s right! Man is seeking salvation, and this seeking leads him to the “New Birth!”
       But he only later wakes up to find out, that it was the Lord, that was causing him to do the
       seeking. See! God allows it all and all the circumstances. He’s Convinced, convicted and
       converted.
      
       49
       Matthew 7:7-Reference quote:
       7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
        Every one of these elected gifts to Christs…In closing now. Every one of these presents,
       every one of these elected gifts, that’s givin to Christ, when they come into Christ…When these
       gifts comes into his hands here on earth, then they in return…Once they become gifts, then they
       in return are givin eternal life. Brother, that’s wonderful!
        Now Jesus said, “He that heareth my words of truth and believeth on him that sent this
       preacher that preaching that’s the truth he said, “I’ll give unto him eternal life. And he shall
       never parish and he shall never come into condemnation, but pass from death unto life.”
       
       John 5:24-Reference quote: 24Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me,
       hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto
       life.
        So, let me say this! This is where I differ with the Pentecostal’s, I sure differ with them.
       “When do you receive eternal life, when you receive the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.” No sir re!
       You receive eternal life when you are begotten of the word of truth. And if you never hear the
       truth, you’ll never be set free!
        Now let me say this, oh just let me squeeze this in before I close. There are multitudes of
       people that are convicted that they are sinners. There are multitudes of people, that in themselves
       they desire to be saved. Nobody wants to be lost. They desire to be saved and then they go and
       join a church. They turn out, to quit that, quit this and they turn out to be a good moral person,
       but as far as ever being saved they’ll never be saved. They will it! They will it, they didn’t want
       to be lost. They willed it!
        But see, they never was gifts to the father, see. You say, “Brother Bob it seems like it’s not
       far!” Remember, it’s not him that willeth or him that runneth but God that showeth mercy! And
       who are you to say man, that “God is wrong!” Who are we to say, we can’t! See!
        Now notice here, did not God not tell Cain…When Abel was saved by a revelation on the
       Blood. Is, that right? (Amen) When Cain got mad at Abel and was going to kill him, did not
       God’s audible voice speak out from heaven and said, “Cain why are you wroth, why is you
       countenance fallen? Why are you angry at your brother? If thou doest not well, will thou not be
       excepted with God? And if thou doest evil, sin lieth at the door.”
       Genesis 4:6-Reference quote:
       6 And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
       7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.
       And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
        God knew that those people that joined the churches and everything, God knew that they
       wouldn’t walk with the word.
        I know, see I don’t mean to say those things to hurt you! But I’m duty bound to say what God
       said. See there’s a multitude of women, that would not believe what I’m preaching because that I
       preach the word of God, that they can’t line up with!

       55-1001 - Expectation
       William Marrion Branham
       What’s the matter with the world today, we got too much intellectual religion. There is such a
       things as having intellectual… I don’t mean to be rude, I don’t mean to hurt people’s feelings,
       but the trouble with these evangelists today, that’s crossing the nation today a preaching the
       Word, they say they go and have a big meeting and thousands are converted, and go back a
       few weeks, and there’s not hardly any of them left. What is it? They receive a intellectual faith.
       24 Now, God is not known by intellectual faith. God is known by the experience of new birth,
       only alone. Jesus said, “Except a man be born again of the Spirit of God, he cannot even see
       the Kingdom of God.” Now, any Bible scholar here knows that the word “see” there does not
       mean “look with your eye.” It means “understand.” You—you say, “I… Looking at something or
       other, say, “I just don’t see it.” You mean; you don’t understand it; you’re looking right at it.
       You look with your eyes, but understand with your heart. That’s right. You can’t understand
       it. And no man can know nothing of God, until first you’re borned of the Spirit of God. The
       Bible said, “No man can call Jesus, Christ.” Only by the Holy Spirit is the only thing that…
       You can say, “Well, I believe He’s the Son of God.” If you haven’t been born again, you’re
       taking somebody’s word for it. You say, “The Bible said so.” That’s right; the Bible’s right, but
       what about you? You say, “The preacher said so.” The preacher’s right, but what about you?
       “Mother said so.” Mother’s right, but what about you? It’s a personal experience of your own
       that you’ve got to be borned again or you’ll never understand God. 25 And then He will reveal
       Himself to you just as He knows you have need of. Now, there’s two things in you that—that
       draws the opinion. First there’s an intellectual part, which is your mental part. And the next is
       your soul. You have a soul and a mind. And the…
        The Bible said, “It is a shame for a woman to cut her hair.” Now truly is don’t make no
       difference to me if the women cut their hair.” I don’t care either way, see. But personally, I like
       long hair. See! Not because God said that, I just like long hair. I think a woman is a woman when
       she’s got long hair, it’s better.
        But see, I’ve preached in churches and everything was amen glory to God, everything was
       wonderful. Then when I tested this in many places. I thought now, if that woman that was
       shouting praising God and speaking in tongues, I’m gonna see how much she shouts and praises
       God when I preach on that short hair. And then I find out, all that wonderful feeling goes away
       when I said, “You women that cut your hair, you cut your glory off! The Bible said, if a woman
       cut her hair, Paul said it is a shame!” Then everything goes wrong. All sad and the meetings
       ruined and everything.
        The preacher come up and said, “You just ruined the meeting brother!” I said, “How’s that
       brother? He said, “The preaching against the hair like that, hair don’t mean nothing!” I said, “It
       does mean something!” God said, the Bible said, “It’s a shame for a woman to cut her hair." And
       it means just what it said.”
        Well, I preached against short dresses and all the women had short dresses up above their leg
       there. The Bible said, “If a man looketh upon a woman to Lust after her…” See to me!
        The reason I love you…The way that I prove that I love this congregation, is because I tell
       you them TRUTH!

       Corinthians 11:15-Reference quote:
       15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
       1Timothy 2:9-Reference quote:
       9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and
       sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
        One day, if I lied to them and let them live like that and they may miss it, and then on that day
       I’ll hear, “You deceiver Brother Bob, why didn’t you tell me not to do that!” See, so, I’m free!
       Then I’ve got a good conscious towards God!
        Paul said, “It’s a shame for her to cut her hair. Paul said, let the women dress themselves in
       modest apparel, perfecting a meek and quiet spirit. To be good keepers at home and in subjection
       to their husband in all things saith the Lord”
        See, now the Pentecostal’s don’t preach that. They ordain women preachers and let them live
       any way they want to. See what it is, in the ultimate end now… I don’t care if they speak in
       tongues or whatever they do. Now, just believe the word of God. In the end, they’ll be lost. So,
       isn’t it better to take God at his word? (Amen)
        Now watch what a perversion it is, all the women see have cut their hair off and the men is
       letting it grow long. Why, is that? God is showing, there is the men’s long hair is rebuking the
       women with short hair. See, how it’s all turned around?
        Oh, children how we need to flee to the word of God. Unless you want to make heaven your
       home. If you believe that your God’s gift to Christ, then line up with the word of God, REAL
       QUICK! YOUR SOULS at stake. See!
        Now I’m closing. Watch here now!
       See, every one of these elected gifts of Christ receive eternal life, the New Birth by hearing the
       word of truth. See! Now Jesus said in John 10:28, he said; “And I give unto thee the gift eternal
       life and they shall never parish and neither shall any man pluck them out of my father’s hand for
       my father which giveth me these gifts are greater than all!” Is, that right? (Amen)
       John 10:28,29-Reference quote:
       28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them
       out of my hand.
       29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of
       my Father's hand.
        Now listen to this scripture. In closing, I’ve closed five times, now seven I’ll really close. I
       say that seven times, I’ll really close.
        God said…listen to this. Psalms 119:89 said, “For ever oh Lord, thy word is settled in
       heaven”
       Psalms 119:89
       89 For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.
       Isaiah 46:10

       52
        Isaiah 46:10, God declaring the end from the beginning” God is so great he can declare the
       end from the beginning. “And from the ancient of times the things that are not yet done, he
       declares them.” “God said my counsel and my will shall stand and I will do all my pleasures.”

       64-0816 - Proving His Word
       William Marrion Branham
       68 When you understand it, you believe it. Jesus said, “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the
       Kingdom,” in other words, “understand the Kingdom,” because the Kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you.
       So you have to understand what this is in you. And the only way you’ll understand it, is compare what it
       makes you do with what the Bible said it would make you do. Then your problem’s solved, see. And, then,
       He is that Holy Spirit. 69 So, seeing is not believing. I can prove that by the senses of the body, see, that
       seeing is not believing. I cannot see this bottle of oil. I could not see it because it’s behind me, yet I have a
       sense of—of feeling that tells me I’ve got it in my hand. See? Now, I couldn’t see it, it’s impossible. And
       now I cannot reach it, it’s impossible, and yet I believe it. This, seeing is believing; this, feeling is
       believing. Now I close my eyes, I neither could see it or feel it, but if I get it close and could smell it, I still
       believe it’s there. So, “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence,” not seen, taste, felt,
       smell, or heard. You believe it! And faith must have a resting place. And anything that’s contrary to the
       Word of God, faith in God can have no resting place unless it’s a promise of God. And there it takes its
       Eternal stand. 70 But in the face of all these un-…doubting ages and things that we have went through
       and live in today, the worst of all, in the face of all this doubt, God does go right on proving His Words to
       be right, as He has in every age. He…Unbelief doesn’t stop God, it doesn’t hinder Him. I don’t care how
       much the world unbelieves, It’s still going to happen. Unbelief doesn’t do nothing but condemns the
       unbeliever. The unbelief will send the unbeliever to Hell. It’ll rob him of every blessing God promised to
       him, but it doesn’t hinder God from going right on with the believer. See, unbelief doesn’t stop God, it
       only stops the unbeliever. 71 You say, “I…The sun ain’t going to shine tomorrow, I’m going to stop it.”
       You try it. See? All right, you can’t do it. God has set it in order and said it would shine, and it’s going to
       shine, that’s all, He said it would. Might be some clouds under it, but it’s still shining just the same. And
       you can’t stop God with that. He, what… 72 How does He make His Word known to the people? First,
       God knowing that there would be unbelievers…Now watch the wisdom of God; knowing there would be
       unbelievers, and how the majority would be unbelievers. He, by foreknowledge, predestinated a seed for
       every age, that would believe It. Now if you’ll notice in there, for, each age goes right on with His
       Word, everything right on time, nothing hinders God. He goes right on, and every click is moving just
       exactly right. We think, sometimes, it’s not going to work right. But don’t you worry, His clock is timed
       just exactly to the split instant, and everything’s working just exactly right. 73 When I look around
       sometime and see these Rickys and Rickettas that we got today, and on the streets, and how everything’s
       going on, I think, “O God!” 74 “Wait a minute,” He says, see, “My timepiece is turning just exactly
       right. I’ve got to put you upon the same basis I did the first man, them days. And I put you on the same
       basis of Luther, and on the same basis of Wesley.” Because, you see, sin wasn’t known then like it is now.
       And when we got more knowledge now than we had then, and when the enemy comes in like a flood,
       the Spirit of God raises a standard against it. See? And now today, we’ve got more knowledge, more
       understanding, so the rivers of unbelief is flowing in hard, but God raises a standard against it. But,
       remember, He’s always…The reason that He—He predestinated these things to happen. He foretold
       them by His prophets they would happen. And when the righteous see these things confirmed, then
       they know It’s right. Regardless of what anyone else says, they know It’s right. 75 We find out over there
       in—in—in, I believe, it’s in First Thessalonians, He said, “He has predestinated us to the adoption of
      
       53
       children by Jesus Christ.” God, not saying, “I’ll choose you, and don’t choose you,” but His
       foreknowledge knowed what you would do. So, by foreknowledge He can set in order, and He’s made
       everything to work for His good, and for your good.
        Now listen! Now brother and sister in closing, let us have this confidence that he that which
       hath begun a good work in us will perform it, until the day of Jesus Christ…When in the endtime in the dispensation of the fullness of all times, he’ll gather all things in Christ which are
       upon the earth and in Heaven, all in him. And we have all things in Christ this morning, freely
       givin to us this morning by his unmerited grace.
        Now listen! As many as received him the word truth, to them gave he power to become the
       manifestations of the sons of God. Even to them that believe on his name, which we’re saved not
       of the will of man nor the will of the flesh, nor the will of blood but by THE WILL OF GOD!
       HE BEGOT US THROUGH THE WORD OF TRUTH, which is the gospel of our salvation.
       And after that ye hear the word of truth you shall be sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise
       which is the earnest of your inheritance.
       John 1:12-Reference quote:
       12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them
       that believe on his name:
       13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
       Ephesians 1:13-Reference quote:
       13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in
       whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
        Let’s bow our heads. Oh, my Lord! While our sisters come to the piano and
       the organ.
        I love the word of God. It’s pure! The word of the Lord is established in the heavens and shall
       endure forever.
        Now I didn’t mean to run that late, but I just couldn’t get it over any quicker.
       Dear brother and sister do you realize the grace of God? “For by grace are you saved, through a
       revelation not of works at least any man should boast.” “Not him that willeth or him that
       runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.”
        To think that God loves you, before the foundation of the world. And he has set you before
       his face, holy and without blame before him in his Love and he has foreordained and
       predestinated thee gifts to be conformed to the very image of the Lord Jesus.
        There’s no half way Christians. I never did see a half drunk sober man. You’re either drunk or
       your sober.
        All these gifts in the end-time are to be conformed to the very image of Jesus Christ. Do you
       believe all the word of God? The Bible said, “Be ye therefore perfect even as your father which
       is in heaven is perfect.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       Here is what I am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth
       after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let the earth bring forth
       grass, and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
       itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and
       thence into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the
       church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. In these last
       days the true Bride Church (Christ’s seed) will come to the Headstone, and she will be the
       super church, a super race, as she nears Him. They in the bride will be so much like Him that
       they will even be in His very image. This is in order to be united with Him. They will be one.
       They will be the very manifestation of the Word of the living God. Denominations cannot
       produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their dogmas, mixed with the
       Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product.

       95 It’s all drawed down, if we had time. I know it’s getting late, and it’s getting late. 96 But look,
       friends, the hour has come, and is now, that when God’s great drama is set here before us. The
       Son of God, that was in the cradle, is in the heart now. He is the Deity of God. He is God, the
       Creator. He said, “All things…He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the
       world knew Him not.” 97 And, today, that’s what’s the matter with the church. The hope of
       Glory, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, has come into the people’s hearts, and they don’t
      
       55
       recognize what It is. They think it’s a little church-joining, or something like that. 98 But that is
       the God, the Creator, living in you, and giving you all the Powers. And you’re in possession of
       anything that He had. So is It in you to abstain from evil, to do good, to shun evil and flee to
       righteousness, to turn away from temptation. All malice, hatred, strife, envy, and so forth, turn
       away from it, for that’ll take Him from your heart. If you will receive Him, embrace Him and
       love Him, and hold Him in your heart and love Him! I can tell you, the church together in that
       kind of a Power, has the Power to bind the heavens, heal the sick, open the eyes of the blind,
       hallelujah, the deaf speak…the dumb speak, and the deaf hear, the cripples walk, the blind
       see. Why? It’s recognizing the Power of Almighty God into your heart. There He is, the Deity.

       us Lord, to look more like you day by day. Until that day that Christ will be fully matured and
       formed within us. And there will be a real apostolic powerful Church of Jesus Christ upon the
       earth. With great apostolic signs and wonders. God let every person here in this building be a

       Word? What did you do with my word? Let us pray!
        Now father God how we pray, thou knowest the hands that was lifted, thou knew them before
       the foundation of the world. Thou knowest the beginning from the end and the end from the
       beginning. Lord I pray, that thou would reveal thy word to those hands that was lifted. Let thy
       truth, may come into their soul, that they may begotten through the word of truth. That they
       might live for eternity, with thee and thy Bride and thy saints. Father bless them! Oh, Lord if
       there was something more that we could do in this hour, to help the poor peoples of this world.
       Lord we pray that thy great power, will come into thy word and make it live. Let the glorious
       light of the gospel shine around the earth. And let the people know that the world can’t be won to
       Christ through money. But through the grace and the love of God. For we ask it in Jesus name.
       And may we take these things in our heart, amen.
        Now, be dismissed and take the name of Jesus with you.
       The End:

       Brother Lambert prays opening prayer:
        Let us offer a word of prayer to the Lord.
       Gracious heavenly father, we’re very thankful to be gathered together again on this Sunday
       morning. Realizing Lord, there’s not too many more settings of the sun father, until the little
       Bride will be taken off the earth. Lord, we come before the judgement seat of Christ this morning
       father. Praying Lord, that we may examine ourselves to see whether we will be found in the
       faith! We believe that this is very needful in this hour, when there is so much confusion in the
       land today. Lord we pray, that you’ll work a work in our hearts this morning with thy word and
       pray that you would forgive us of all of our sins and our short comings. We pray Lord, that we
       may continually be formed to the very image of Christ Jesus our Lord. We pray father God, that
       we’ll have that great victory in the Love Divine, that we’ll be able to love our enemies Lord. To
       be able to do good to those that despise us and misuse us father. We pray Lord, that you’ll help
       us because we’re poor in spirit. We don’t come to you, great and mighty, strong, filled with the
       spirit with our cup running over this morning. We come honest in our heart, we’re poor in spirit,
       we’re needy this morning! We pray, that you would have mercy upon us Lord. We don’t want
       judgement, we ask for mercy! And we pray, that you’ll be merciful also Lord, to this poor sin
       sick cursed world. We pray that the great thing that you promised to do in this last day, and part
       of it you’ve already done and we pray that soon you’ll do the rest Lord. Bless each and every one
       that’s in our gates this morning. And may they not return from this building, without a blessing
       father. Bless us all together, it’s so good to be assembled among a people that love you. To see
       the tears dripping down their faces and to see how they act at the name of Jesus. We’re so
       thankful, that you revealed thy name to us Lord. And we just pray, that you’ll just continually to
       tell us of your name. We pray that you’ll reveal, the great secret of thy new name to thy children
       soon, Lord. We pray now, that you’ll bless us together in Jesus name, amen.
        You may be seated. I’m very thankful, to be here again this morning. We have another chance
       to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ.
        It’s so wonderful, that he told us his name. We’re looking forward to God revealing more
       about his great name, before the little Bride takes flight. I’m sure there will be great tremdous
       love secrets whispered to her by the Lord Jesus, before she leaves the earth.
        We believe we’re living in a tremdous hour for the believer, a glorious hour. The greatest
       hour that you could ever possibly live as a Christian is today! We also believe it’s a terrible hour,
       for the make believer and the unbeliever. We should ever be mindful and ever so thankful, to the
       Lord God that he enabled us to be living in this end-time, when he’s gonna share his glory with
       his people, he’s gonna manifest. And so we just pray, that we all might be alert and be reverent
       and respectful to the Lord. And most of all, be honest hearted!
       
       2
        I’m afraid, that this age will go down as the most dishonest, so-called believers of any age. I
       find today, that there’s some kind of a power that holds the people, that won’t let them be honest.
       So many, claim to be the great Bride of Christ and have the great powers of Christ and yet…We
       and those that are honest hearted are finding out that it’s only a shim-sham, as we’d say out here
       today.
        But we not only want to profess, but we want to possess. We want to be able to prove that
       Jesus Christ has rose from the dead. We believe it’s our spiritual moral responsibility, for us as
       so-called Christians to literally prove that Jesus rose from the dead. This is the good news! And
       until we are able to prove infallibly, that Jesus Christ rose from the dead, then we forfeit our
       rights in calling ourselves Christians. We can go on saying we’re Christians, we can go on saying
       we’re the Bride, we can go on saying we’re the true church, but to be able to prove it to the
       world, that’s something else. So therefore, I believe in the heart or should be in the heart of every
       child of God in this hour, is to be earnestly desiring for the time to arrive that you might be able
       to prove, that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.
        It’s like that great Mohamed, that told the preacher that came to Brother Branham. He had
       many degrees around his wall and he came to Brother Branham and gave him a story after he so
       ridiculed him and called him an antichrist almost. He came to Brother Branham to ask, “If he
       would lay his hands upon him, so he could receive the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.” And he told
       this story, of all the great degree’s he had and how he sponsored a Mohamed through college.
       And then when he put him on the plane and shook his hand and said, “Son won’t you renounce
       this ole prophet Mohamed and take the Lord Jesus Christ back to your people?” And then the
       young Mohamed said, “Sir, what can your Lord Jesus Christ do for me, that my Mohamed
       prophet can’t do?” He said, “Well, he can give you eternal life!” The young man said, “Well
       Mohamed promised us eternal life!” He said, “Well Jesus Christ can give you joy!” The young
       man said, “We have Joy!” Then the young Mohamed said to the great theologian said, “Sir!
       Mohamed can produce just as much psychology as Christianity. Sir we Mohamed’s, our prophet
       only promised us one thing, Life after death!” But he said, “Your prophet Jesus Christ promised
       you, you teachers, you preachers that the very works he did you’d do. We Mohamed’s have been
       waiting all these hundreds of years for you Christians to prove that Jesus Christ rose from the
       dead and it’s been hundreds and hundreds of years since Christ died and you haven’t proved it
       yet. Two thirds of the world still don’t know about Christ! But there’s a white horse waiting at
       the grave of our prophet Mohamed twenty-four hours a day and when he raises from the dead the
       whole world will know about it overnight. We’re waiting for you people to prove what your
       taking about.”
        Still this morning two thirds of the world have never heard the name of Jesus Christ. How
       much more of the world have never seen the demonstration and the power of the word of God
       made manifested?
        So, I can say what I want to hear. And this is what I believe!
       I believe the gospel is supernatural all the way! I believe everything about God is supernatural.
       And I believe the plan of the devil in this hour, is to take the supernatural away from the people
       of God and give them a natural. We’ll never get the job done, that God called us to do without
       the power of the Holy Ghost! And I love the word of God dearly with all my heart, I love the
       word of God!
        But people are putting too much emphasis upon the word, without the power of God! You can
       do more with one scripture, if you really believed it and the power of God to back it up, then if
       
       3
       you could quote the whole Bible! Not taking away from the word! The word is the power of
       God! But we need the word, turned into power!
        And that’s what I’m trying to get over to this assembly, “that the gospel did not COME IN
       WORD ONLY, BUT IN DEMONSTRATION OF POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST!” And this
       is what the world, is waiting to see!
       1 Thessalonians 1:5-Reference quote:
       For our Gospel came unto you not in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and
       in much assurance, as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
        The world has sent out missionaries, by the thousands and their good. And this message is
       sending out missionaries. One fine brother I seen down at the tape meeting, a lovely brother and
       God blessed him with a great big bus-van. Beautiful wonderful machine to take over in Africa
       with. And he’s got plenty of books of Brother Branham and plenty of tracks and plenty of tapes,
       but that is not the gospel now! It’s not the gospel!
        See we used to say, “Come see a man!” See, you can’t lean on that no more! God took the
       crutch out from under us, see. And now we have got to prove ourselves as the church of Jesus
       Christ. That Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and is alive for ever more, for the works that he
       once did are manifested in his people. That’s the Bride of Christ!
        And now what we got around the country, is everything calling their self the Bride and
       nobody able to prove it. Therefore, we forfeit our right to call ourselves the Bride. And if you’ll
       only remember, we could very well make the same mistake that the Laodicean church age made,
       in saying they we’re the church of Christ and all the time spue Christ out of the church. Put him
       on the outside. Isn’t that terrible? (Amen) Went on saying, “They were the Bride, they we’re the
       elite! They we’re Justified, sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost.”
       Did not have no need of Christ and put him on the outside. Who was it that they put on the
       outside? Not the body of Jesus Christ, that he died at Calvary in! But they put the prophet of God
       on the outside, they did. (William Branham) And when they did that Jesus said, “You put me
       out.” And he said, you said, “You have need of nothing” Jesus said you say, “That you have need
       of nothing!” Laodicean Church age, so-called Pentecost. You say, “You have need of nothing”
       You say, “Your rich in the spirit” I say, “Your poor in the spirit!” You say, “That you have the
       wedding garment, the baptism of the Holy spirit the seal of God!” I say, “You don’t!” You say,
       “Your clothed” I say, “Your naked!” Now, who am I gonna believe? I’M GONNA BELIEVE
       JESUS CHRIST! Who are you gonna believe? Believe the word of God!
       Revelation 3:17
       17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and
       knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:

       65-1204 - The Rapture
       William Marrion Branham
       4 Did you know the Protestant and Catholic church is predicted, in the last days, to be blind, the
       same thing, to the Scriptures, with Christ on the outside, trying to get in? “Because thou sayest,
       ‘I am rich, and have need of nothing,’ knowest thou not that thou art miserable, poor, wretched,
       
       4
       naked, and blind, and don’t know it,” Revelation 3. There you are, back to the blindness again,
       trampling over the things of God, as if (they) It didn’t mean nothing to them, scoffing and making
       fun of It. That’s what the Bible said. 65 But, to the Church, the Bride, the Rapture is a
       revelation to Her. It’s revealed to Her. That, the revelation, the true Bride of Christ will be
       waiting for that revelation of the Rapture. 66 Now, it is a revelation, for the revelation is faith.
       You cannot have a revelation without it being faith. Faith is a revelation, because it’s
       something that’s revealed to you. Faith is a revelation. Faith is something that has been
       revealed to you, like it was to Abraham, that could call anything contrary to what had been
       revealed to him, as though it wasn’t so. Now, faith, that’s what faith is, is the revelation of
       God. The Church is built upon a revelation, the whole entire Body.

       65-1125 - The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       334 These things wasn’t done in a corner, friend. Remember, “Strait is the gate and narrow is
       the way, and but few there’ll be that will find it.” Don’t go with that crowd that’s moving on
       yonder, friend, that Laodicea Church Age. It could jump up-and-down, dance under music,
       lukewarm. Didn’t say it was ice cold, now, it said it was lukewarm, that’s the Pentecostal, and
       don’t know that it’s miserable, wretched, blind. Blind to what? The Word, to the manifestation
       of the Word; because It never come through their organizations, they cannot receive It. 335
       And you ministers down there in Tucson, tonight, I don’t hold you responsible for that. God does.
       I was there for three years. I told you I wouldn’t start a church. I didn’t. Brother Pearry Green
       started it. I was there three years, and not one time did you invite me to your pulpit. I set in
       Tucson for nearly three years. God will take me from the desert one of these days. This
       Message must live. I tried my best to get in to you. I—I know the reason you did it. You hear?
       Only reason you did it, your denomination would kick you out. And you know, many of you I’ve
       talked to, there at Furr’s Restaurant, and you know it’s the truth. Shame on you. 336 Come out
       of it. Get out of there, brother. If there’s any Life in you, you’ll be like that little eagle I just
       spoke of, you’ll hear the Word of God. Remember, you’re going to hear This for the last time,
       one of these days. We’re real close now. Won’t you come, tonight? 337 Dear God, we set
       solemnly now, a thanksgiving day it really is, Lord. I am grateful, Lord, to be living in this day.
       This is the greatest day. Paul the apostle longed to see this day. The great men of old longed to
       see it. The prophets longed to see it. They looked for this day. Abraham looked for this day, for
       he sought for a City whose Builder and Maker was God; it hangs right above us, tonight. John
       seen the Spirit of God descending out of Heaven, bore record, knowed that that was the Son of
       God. And, think now, He’s choosing His Bride.
       
        This church is POOR in spirit! It’s not rich in the spirit, but poor in spirit. We need a filling of
       the Holy Ghost more this morning more than we need anything else! We need the gospel to
       come forth in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost, see.

       favor with God, if I had to eat soda crackers, and drink branch water, and be pre—preaching
       the truth, than to have fried chicken three times a day, and have my collar turned around, and
       standing for something that I knowed was a lie.” Amen. Amen. That’s free. That’s right. God’s

       We don’t need all this here stuff that’s so-called Christianity today, walking together, trying to
       unite together like the World Council of Churches. What the world… When unbelief, and
       unbelievers, and everything mixed up together in, how we ever go on? What we need is an oldfashion, backwoods, sky-blue, sin-killing religion… [Blank spot on tape—Ed.]… Gospel
       power, and the Holy Ghost preached in the power of the resurrection. Get a dose of Saint
       Paul’s revival and the Bible Holy Ghost, convincing the men. We need to see Christ come
       among us and perform, and do just exactly where He said, “He that believeth in Me, the works
       that I do shall he do also. More than this shall he do, ’cause I go to My Father.”
        Then people say, “Well, your a sign seeker” Well, what are you gonna do? God’s word is true
       and every man’s a liar.
       Romans 3:3,4
       3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
       4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be
       justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
        Well, we’ve been having a wonderful time, at least I did last Sunday morning. I see, we have
       a visitor with us, may God bless him. I noticed we’ve been having a few visitors comin along
       and it’s a great blessing. I’m thankful for those that come in and fellowship with us. I’m so
       thankful we don’t have nothing to join, we’re free. We don’t have no man ruling over us, but we
       do believe that Gods ministry that rules over us by the word. Not by a personality, not by
       intellectual powers, but the Bride of Christ will let you rule over them by the word and that’s all.
        So, we’re thankful to God, that he’s give us his word in this last day through the great prophet
       messenger. (William Branham) We don’t believe that he as the messenger was the finisher of our
       faith! But we do believe, that he brought this faith. And we believe that Jesus Christ, is gonna
       finish it off.

       211 I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and started praying. I heard
       a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, “What are you leaning against, over your
       heart?” And I raised back like this, my bare shoulders; naked from my waist up, hot. I looked
       back. And there was wrote in the quartz, in the stone, “White Eagle”; just exactly what the
       vision said that the next Message would come forth by. 212 I was so excited, I run home; got a
       camera and come back the next day, and took the picture of it. It was still there, wrote in the

       William Marrion Branham
       It may be time, it may be the hour now, that this great person that we’re expecting to rise on
       the scene may arise on the scene. 327 Maybe this ministry, that I have tried to take people back
       to the Word, has laid a foundation; and if it has, I’ll be leaving you, for good. There won’t be
       two of us here the same time. See? If it is, he’ll increase; I’ll decrease. I don’t know. 328 But I
       have been privileged, by God, to look and see what It was, see, see unfold to that much. Now,
       that is the Truth.
        Now, last week I took it on myself to start a little different ministry. I’ve been ministering
       mostly on revelation for the last few years and I haven’t done too much teaching. But I thought it
       was needful for those who just come to the Lord Jesus. We have several here, young people.
       
       7
       Then I find a very lack of the knowledge of the word of God, among those that have been saved
       for some time now.
        And I thought it would do good, if we kinda look into the word of God and just see what a
       great covenant Christ has givin you. Because I believe, it’s a legal thing that Christ has givin us.
       Christ has givin us something legally, according to the word of God. And we ought to be able, to
       see what Christ has done for us.
        And of course, in doing this we grind out a lot of error, that’s been put into our spirits are
       minds, coming up through this last church age. You’d be surprised, that the error in people’s
       mind that has come out of this last church age. People are still carrying over their new birth from
       the Laodicean Church Age. Carrying over their baptism of the Holy Spirit and carry it over to the
       bride age. And just excepting the message and goin on. Their gonna find out when rolls around,
       their gonna have to get rid of all that! It won’t hold up in the word of God at all.
        So therefore, I’m responsible to Jesus Christ to prove all things. Not by my opinion, not what
       I think about it! But to prove all things by the word of God. And then when I prove it solid by the
       word of God, then I trust that you will hold fast to that which is proven.
       1 Thessalonians 5:21
       21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
        See, we’ve got to make our experience fit the word of God. Not make Christ the word of God,
       fit our experience. See, we’ve got to fit right into the word of God! Make ourselves line up, right
       with the word, see.
        Now last Sunday, I started…Maybe I’ll minister a couple of Sunday’s on it, on “God’s
       Unconditional Covenant to The Elected Bride of Christ” This is a tremdous study, it’s full of all
       kinds of good Vitamins. It may not be so exciting to minister as revelation, but it does have
       revelation in it to.
        And I pray, that you’ll study those chapters of the Bible that I ask you to study and that was
       the fifth and the sixth and the seventeenth chapter of the gospels of John. I believe it would do
       good for every child of God to memorize the seventeenth chapter of John.
        And this doctrine has totally been turned down by this last church age. And I showed you by
       the word of God, that I do not believe that you can ever be saved and be lost! I don’t believe
       there is two New Births! I don’t believe you can repent and do your first works over again as far
       as being Born Again.
        I don’t know of any person that was born of their mother, that ever got born again. But neverthe-less there is so many so-called great theologian’s and great ministers, literally teach and
       preach that you can be unborn and be reborn again. I don’t believe it!
        Neither do I believe, that you can receive the Baptism of the Holy Ghost the second time. I
       say that because I find no scripture. So therefore, I know if I stay right with the word of God, I’m
       gonna come out safe.
        There is no possible way in the word of God for you to ever be reborn and then be lost. There
       is no such thing in Gods Bible as bein reborn then Lost.
        And there’s no such a thing in Gods Bible, for you to be re'baptized by the Holy Ghost. I ask
       one preacher, one theologian somebody to show me one scripture in the Bible that. I’ve asked
       several and I never had a man give me one scripture yet. So, then if we don’t have any scripture
       for it, why do we go on and preach it and teach it? See!
       
       8
        Now that’s why I believe, that nobody had the Baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Seventh
       Church Age! I know that shocks people and they go away and say terrible things, about this and
       that! I can’t help that! But face it right, with the word of God one time! Face it up, with the word
       of God, take your Bible and disapprove it one time! It can’t be done!
        Let me tell you something! If the Seven Church age had the Baptism of the Holy
       Ghost…Come On!
        How many believe, Brother Branham taught these steps of Grace? Justification, Sanctification
       and Baptism of the Holy Ghost!
        Now notice here! The Seven Church Age, and all the people that come out of the seventh
       church age testified that, “They had the Baptism of the Holy Ghost!” The Baptism of the Holy
       Ghost, is the Seal of God! The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is, 1 Corinthians 12:13.
       1 Corinthians 12:13
       13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
       we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
        You’d be surprised at the ministers…I’ve been ministering for years and I asked one great
       minister I said, “Give me your scripture for the Baptism of the Holy Ghost?” Did you know he
       couldn’t do it! He was afraid! And I said, “Give me one scripture Brother, for the Baptism of the
       Holy Ghost? I’m waiting!” And he, hemmed hawed around. I said, “Why are you afraid to
       answer me?” He said, “Well, I’m just thinking Brother Bob” Well I said, “Well, if the Baptism
       of the Holy Ghost is so great and you can’t give me a scripture for it!” I said, “There’s something
       wrong somewhere!”
       Hem and haw: -Reference Definition meaning:
       To stop often and change what one is saying during speech because one is not sure of what to
       say or because one is trying to avoid saying something The question surprised her and
       she hemmed and haweda bit before answering.
        Listen! This is our soul that’s involved here, friend! You better be getting your eyes open to
       why the Laodicean Church ages are blind to, in this hour. Their blind to THE BAPTISM OF
       THE HOLY GHOST!
        Jesus said, “If thou knewest the gift of God and who it was speaking to you!”
       John 4:10
       10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to
       thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
       water.
        Remember the Laodicean Church Age, put Jesus Christ out on the outside and they said,
       “They had the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.” The Seventh Church age, did not have the Baptism
       of the Holy Ghost!
        And when the true Baptism of the Holy Ghost come, the true seal of God come, in Malachi
       4:5 (William Branham) they put that Baptism on the outside! Why did they put it on the outside?
       Because they already said it. In other words, they already claimed they had something, that the
       prophet of God was trying to get to them, that they didn’t have!
       
       9
        AND I SAY, A GREATER THAN SOLOMON IS HERE TODAY!
       Greater than Solomon!
        They put him right on the outside. Yet they said, “They we’re justified and sanctified” And I
       can prove by Gods word infallible, that they we’re not justified, they we’re not sanctified and
       they did not have the Baptism of the Holy Ghost! Hmmm, do you think so? They never had it!
        The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is Gods perfection! How can you be any more perfect, then
       come into Christ?
        I don’t have no perfection of my own. I don’t have no holiness of my own. I don’t have no
       sanctification of my own. It’s all givin to me! And you cannot be any more perfect, then to be in
       Christ! Because we have all things, in Christ! How do we get into Christ? By one Holy Spirit are
       we all baptized into Christ.
       Philippians 4:13
       13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
       1 Corinthians 12:13
       13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
       we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
       Now don’t tell me, that Billy Graham was baptized by the Holy Ghost! Don’t tell me, that TL
       Osborn was baptized with the Holy Ghost! Don’t tell me that, that’s not found in God’s Bible
       nowhere. There’s no unclean thing, that can be joined with a clean thing!
       Your either, WORD BORN OR YOUR NOT WORD BORN! Don’t tell me Dr. Gram is word

       309 Like somebody said, said, “Brother Branham, how you ever have anybody to listen to you?”
       Said, “I can see Billy Graham, he’s got every denomination in the country with him. I can see
       Oral Roberts, every Pentecostal hangs right to him. But,” said, “you’re against the whole
       thing.” Uh-huh. Said, “How in the world do you ever get anybody?” 310 I said, “It’s God!”
       311 “I the Lord hath planted it before the foundation of the world. I’ll water it day and night
       unless some of them should pluck it from My hand,” Isaiah. “I’ll water, I planted it. I put
       their names on the Book before the foundation of the world, by predestination. I’ll water it,
       just keep on moving. I’ll furnish the water, you just spray It out.” Right. See? “I’ll water it day
       and night unless one of them gets plucked out of My hand.” There you are.
        The Prophet of God said, “Judas was justified” But put it in the word of God one time! Oh,
       you say, “Now you’re talking about the prophet!” NO! I’M TRYING TO GET YOU TO LOOK
       IN YOUR BIBLES! LOOK IN YOUR BIBLE AND SEE WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT IT!
        Why, if you came to the prophet and he knew you knew the word of God, he’d say that?
       God’s prophet can only say what Gods word said! The Bible said, “THOSE WHOM HE
       JUSTIFIED, HE SANCTIFIED AND THOSE THAT HE SANCTIFIED, HE HATH
       
       10
       ALREADY GLORIFIED! EVEN BEFORE THE WORLD WAS EVER CREATED HE DONE
       IT!
       Romans 8:30
       30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
       justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
        No sir! Brother and sister, we’re gonna find out that, “NARROW IS THE WAY THAT

       Romans 3:4-Reference quote:
       4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be

        I’m going to prove to you next Sunday, by the help of God that Judas was never Justified!
       Judas was never Sanctified! And Judas was never called of the Lord Jesus Christ! I’ll prove it

        Listen! WE GOT TO GET DOWN TO TRUTH! THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG,
       SOMEWHERE!
       IF EVERYBODY THAT WAS FOLLOWING THIS GREAT MESSAGE HAD THE
       BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, YOU WOULD OF NOT EVEN NEEDED THE
       PROPHET OF GOD TO EVEN COME! The very reason he come was to rebuke the lie, that the

       60-1207 - The Pergamean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       83 Now I want you to notice He’s introducing Himself again tonight in Deity. Every church
       was one of His glorified state: the One that had twelve star…or “seven stars in His hand, He
       that has the sharp two-edged sword,” see, something another, “He that has the feet of brass, the
       eyes that run with…a flames of fire.” He’s introducing Himself back to His Deity. 84 Now you
       say, “Where does Deity lay in this, ‘He with a sharp two-edged sword coming out of His
       mouth’?” 85 Well, the sword is the “Word.” Hebrews 4, we took it in the beginning when we run
       that Deity of Him down. The sword, we found in Hebrews 4:12, that was, “The Word of God was
       sharper than a two-edged sword.” Is that right? That was the Word of God. Is it that? Now
       watch, you ha-…get these interpretations. Now trace that Word, Saint John 1, “In the
       beginning” (way back) “was the Word that created the heavens and earth.” Is that right? “And
       the Word was with God, and the Word was Deity. And Deity was made flesh and dwelled
       among us.” Is that right? “The Word was made flesh and dwelled among us.” 86 And here He
       is standing here, the One at the beginning, “Say this to the angel of the church of—of Perga-
       …Pergamos. Say this to him, ‘I am the Word of God.’” Oh, we see Him over in Revelation,
       coming with His vesture dipped in blood, crown upon His head, riding on a white horse, and
       on His thigh was written, “The Word of God.” Oh, I like that. He is the Word, the Word of
       God. So we see this Deity then in the beginning, to introduce Himself, He is the Word. 87
       Now, if He is the living Word, then This wrote on the Bible is part of Him; then if you can
       receive This, into Him (which is the Word), this Word comes into you by faith, makes It alive,
       because the…Oh! Catch That! The Word comes into you, if the Holy Spirit’s in there, it’s
       alive as soon as it comes in, and every promise is true. Nothing… “Therefore, if you say to this
       mountain ‘Be moved,’ and don’t doubt in your heart.” Because (what?) you are Deity
       speaking. You believe it? Bible said so. And whatever you say shall come to pass if you’ll not
       doubt, if you can get all of the—the world bred out of you, let the Holy Spirit make you a full
       son or daughter of God: no world, no condemnation, no doubt. What is it, then? It’s no more
       you, it’s God in you. Then you take His Word, It’s a promise, and say, “Father, it’s Your
       promise.” “Satan,…” Something’s got to move. See? See? 88 Now, you can’t do that until God
       has revealed to you then what that case should be. See? Then when you know what that case
       shall be, then you can say, like Jesus. He was the Word. Is that right? And yet Jesus, the man,
       the tabernacle, said, “I do nothing except the Father shows Me first.” 89 Then it is not the Word
       then until it’s made manifest to you. You get it? No wonder people say “the days of miracles is
       past,” the Word isn’t manifested to them. No wonder they can’t believe in the Holy Spirit, the
       Word’s not manifested to them. No wonder they can’t see the revelation of the baptism in the
       Name of Jesus Christ, the Word isn’t manifested to them yet; and yet they don’t have one
       Scripture to go to, there’s no place where anybody was ever baptized any other way. 90 About
       the Holy Ghost, the Bible said that “No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy
       Ghost,” and people then say they don’t believe that the Holy Ghost is right. See? See, it’s not
       made to them. Jesus said, “No man can come to Me except My Father draws him first. And all
       the Father hath” (past tense) “given Me will come to Me.” Oh, isn’t that beautiful! “All that
       the Father has given Me, will come to Me. None of them will be lost except son of perdition,
       and I’ll…(he was born for that purpose), and I’ll raise him up again at the last day.”
       
       
       12
        The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is none other than, 1 Corinthians 12:13 WHICH IS THE LIFE
       GIVER TO MAKE THE WORD LIVE! It’s the spirit of God coming into the word of God,
       making the word of God live.
       THERE IS NO OTHER WAY FOR YOU TO GET INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST, OUTSIDE
       OF ONE BAPTISM ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST! Which is the
       seal of God! Which is the earnest of your inheritance. Hmm… That will push all darkness away,
       I love the word of God. The Bible said, “In the evening time it shall be light, the path to glory
       you will surely find”
       1 Corinthians 12:13-Reference quote:
       13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
       we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
       Zechariah 14:7-Reference quote:
       7 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it shall come to
       pass, that at evening time it shall be light.
        The Baptism of the Holy Ghost friend, is the message of the hour. We’ve belittled it down
       and devaluated it, like the devaluating the American dollar. The Baptism of the Holy Ghost is
       more devaluated, by SO-CALLED GOD’S MINISTERS THEN ANYTHING I KNOW OF IN
       THE WORLD TODAY! Oh God, that we can take the word of God and put the value back into
       the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. THAT THE CHILDREN OF GOD WILL PRESS THEIR WAY
       TO THAT GREAT GIFT OF GOD! There is no other way for you to leave the earth outside of
       the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.
        The same spirit that dwelled in Jesus Christ dwells in you, by the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.
       He shall quicken the word of God in you and quicken your mortal flesh, raise you from the dead
       and translate you into glory!
        So, therefore it’s no mystery, that the devil attacks my teaching on the Baptism of Holy
       Ghost. I’ve never had one preacher face me down with it yet. It takes them twenty or thirty
       minutes before they can even answer your question. “When did you receive the Baptism of the
       Holy Ghost?” Don’t you tell me you received it out there in some independent some
       denomination. Some brother come along and laid hands on you and you spoke in tongues. I’M
       NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT! I’M TALKING ABOUT THE SEAL OF GOD THAT ONLY
       SEALS, FAITH, VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE, PATIENCE, GODLINESS,
       BROTHERLY KINDNESS.
        YOU NEVER HAD A SPECK OF FAITH, BEFORE THE PROPHET OF GOD COME TO
       THE EARTH AND YOU KNOW IT! The Bible said, “I’ll sent THE PROPHET AND HE’LL
       RESTORE THE FAITH!” You never had it before he come and you know it!

       179 Said, “What’d you go out to see, a prophet?” Said, “I say, and more than a prophet! And if
       you can understand it, this is who was spoken of by the prophet, saying, ‘I send My messenger
       before My face, to prepare the way,’” Malachi 3. 180 And in Malachi 4, for the church age, He
       
       13
       said, “I send to you Elijah before that day.” Now, that couldn’t have been John, ’cause the
       world wasn’t burned up back there and the righteous walked out upon the ashes of the wicked.
       No. It’s this age, a Message that’ll go forth! That’ll what? Restore the Faith of the people, the
       Church today that’s out of all these different corruptions and a putrefied, sored body of
       denomination, back to a living Faith and a living God. The Message has been going on for
       years. That’s right. It’s time now that we should receive and believe: the end-time evangelism is
       to restore. Joel said the same thing, “I will restore all the years the cankerworm eaten.” 181
       Looky here. Remember my Message recently on the Bride tree, see, how that they took Jesus? He
       was a Tree, the One that David saw, a Tree planted by the rivers of water, His fruit in season,
       the most perfect Tree. And they cut Him down and hung Him on a man-made Roman tree, for a
       mockery. But what did He do? Rose up again on the third day. What else did He do? He set forth
       a Bride Tree, a man and a woman like the trees that was in the garden of Eden, two trees. One of
       them, the tree of life, and one the tree of death. And what did He do? He come to redeem this
       tree. So since He redeemed it, at Calvary, He’s ready to plant her now. Oh, my! I get to feeling
       religious when you say that, see. To restore His Bride tree, the one that should have been in
       Eden, but she fell there because she disbelieved the Word. But here He’s going to restore a tree
       that will believe the Word! And when she come up on the Day of Pentecost, that original
       Doctrine, that original Faith, then what did Rome begin to do? Send a cankerworm, send a
       palmerworm. And each one took his part off the fruit, the leaves and everything, and sucked it all
       down. 182 But what did the prophet saw that, he said, “But I will restore that tree, saith the
       Lord.” She started back in the Reformation. What did she do? Organized. God pruned her, right
       in Saint John 14, cut all the organization off of it. And she come back to Wesley, she organized.
       Pruned her off. 183 “But I will restore!” She’s still coming. Now what does it do? In the evening
       time there will be not an organization. There will be a—a top. Where does the fruit ripen at
       first? In the top. Why? The sun hits it. And in the evening time the seeds are planted now for
       an evening-time Bride tree. When the Tree of Life returns back to the Bride tree. You see? And
       the evening Lights has come out now to water and ripen that fruit that’s been on the tree that’s
       been planted. The seeds are sowed. See? The evening time. So the evening-time evangelism will
       be the mark of Malachi 4, to restore the faith of the people back to the Faith of the fathers. Yes,
       sir. Back to the building Stones! Amen. Back to…

       64-0308 - The Token
       William Marrion Branham
       63 You’ve got to have the Token. And when the Token comes, It testifies of Christ. He said It
       would. And Christ is the Word. And how can you deny that the Bible is true, part of It, and still
       say you have the Token, when the Token is the testimony of Jesus Christ? See, there is what I
       wonder. 64 “Oh,” say, “I don’t believe, I believe the days of miracle…” Oh, look out, there is no
       Token there. The Token punctuates every Word with an “amen,” everything, ’cause it’s God
       Itself. See? All right. 65 But if the token was not there, the covenant was not in effect. It was
       annulled. Same now! No matter how—how much you say, how much you’d say, “I believe every
       Word in the Bible,” say, “Brother Branham, I—I can quote you half of that Bible, all the Bible,
       by heart. I believe every bit of It.” That’s good. Satan does, too. Uh-huh. It takes the Token! 66
       “Well, Brother Branham, I’ve got my wall full of degrees. I’m a Bachelor of Art, and I have a
       doctor’s degree, and an LLD. of Latin. And, oh, I’ve wrote books. I’ve done this. I done
       
       14
       everything. I’ve—I’ve done all these things.” I don’t care. That’s all all right, but yet you’ve got
       to have the Token. The Token, still the Token is required! 67 You say, “I’m a Bible student. I’m
       a—I’m a good person. I’m this, that.” That may be fine, that’s all good, but still it’s got to have
       the Token! 68 Now, death was ready to strike Egypt at any time, and so is death ready to strike
       the nation now at any time. 69 Anna Jeanne, I feel something like your dad, said a remark one
       time. I’ve always liked that. He said, “You know, this nation, with the same sins, if God lets
       America get by with what she is doing, He will be morally obligated to raise Sodom and
       Gomorrah up and apologize to them, for burning them.” And that’s right. 70 Remember, Israel
       paid for every sin she did, and so will we. How loosely are we getting? Tighten up the armor!
       Come back to God, church! Not saying these things to be different. I’m telling you as a warning.
       You believe! 71 Death was ready to strike. God had showed them His grace and His mercy,
       through powers and signs and wonders (so has He today before taking the Church out), still
       they desired not to repent and to believe the message. 72 See, there was a message just before
       the taking out of the church. There always has to be. Same now. Every spiritual happening is a
       sign from God. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] Like the Message,
       there is a sign and then the Message follows the sign. God told Moses, said, “If they won’t
       believe the voice of the first sign, maybe they’ll believe the voice of the second sign.” 73 Now,
       when you see signs going on, and no message behind it, just the same old school of theology and
       on down, that wasn’t from God. But where there is a sign showed, a Message follows it. Now
       look. Jesus come on the scene…
       
        You believed in three Gods, false baptism AND EVERYTHING ELSE! YOU BELIEVED

       obey every Word that He’s written! Oh, that’s a dangerous thing. What if you would be a dead
       seed, no Life in you? But there is something in you, that tells you, “I—I want to rise, this
       morning. I want to rise from the state that I’m in. I don’t want to be just a dead seed, be left to
       dirt and driftwood. I want to rise.”

       296 And I was watching myself do it. And then when I was standing there, looking, and watching
       myself preach It. 297 And I was just preaching, to-who-wouldn’t-have-it. And after a bit, I raised
       up, you know, and I thought, “Glory to God!” I said, “Look at these wonderful things, and this,
       that!” 298 Directly, I noticed the people begin to get like they was physically hungry. And so
       they had enough spiritual, so they started walking away. And some of them…[Brother Branham
       yawns—Ed.] Started walking away. I thought, “What’s the matter with everybody?” 299 And—
       and I looked, and here some young couples going along, to my side. I thought…I said, “Just a
       minute, friend! Just a minute! You’ll be back again when the evening shadows fall.” See? I
       said, “You’ll be back again. But let me give you this first climax. Where does all these things
       come from, that I’ve showed you? Where are they from?” I said, “Here they are. They are in
       the Word of God. They are THUS SAITH THE LORD, His promise. Cause,” I said, “all of
       you bear me record, witness this, that my commission is, ‘Stay with the Word.’” I said, “What’s
       the matter with all of you? Can’t you understand the Word? You must understand It.” 300
       And some of them said, “Man, I’d like to have some biscuits,” and so like that. 301 Well, I just
       thought, “Well, glory to God! If they want biscuits, let them go get them.” 302 So I—I turned
       around. I thought, “Oh, but, you know what? The shadows is going to fall, after while, right
       away.” I said, “Then, tonight, when that congregation gathers in again, I’ll put the climax to
       them, and told them that the things that they have seen me do is found in the Word of God, not
       in some mythical book or some organization. It’s found in the Word. See? Every bit of it, in the
       Word, ’cause I’m commissioned to That.” 303 I thought, “You know, they’ll, every one, be back
       tonight, so here is what I’ll do. I’ll background, kind of background.” You know the way I do it
       on these church ages and things, say what I said before. “I’ll background it, on the Word, and
       then this great, marvelous climax.” I said, “What a time it’ll be! Praise be to God!” And I seen
       myself getting real little, and heard that, “Praise be to God.” I seen myself fading up like that.
       And here I was, standing there.
        Preachers still go on devaluating the Holy Ghost. We better rightly valuate, GODS GREAT
       GIFT! Without it you CANNOT go in the rapture.
        No wonder Brother said, “The Token message was the highlights of his whole ministry” Why

       This morning, the message this morning was, to me, the highlights Message of my entire
       ministry; this morning, see, a highlight Message of my entire ministry. Someday I’ll tell you
       how it come about. And I know that everything has worked for months and months and
       months, up to that one Message, moving up to come to that place. That was the capping-off
       time of it, you see. And it’s a… 10 Now I’m sure, or hope, that you got what the Token meant.
       See? The Token is the sign that the Blood has been applied. That, the price that’s been asked,
       
       16
       required of God, Jesus paid that price by shedding His Own Blood. He did that. Then, from His
       life came the Holy Spirit. And when the Blood is applied to you, the Holy Spirit is a Token that
       your price is paid; God has received you, and that’s the Token. Remember, that is the Token.
       Now, there is many people who doesn’t, they—they don’t know what that Token is, see. And you
       have to make it like that nobody knows it, see, so that all of them will get it. 11 Just like
       preaching salvation, we have to preach salvation in a way that everybody, it’s for everybody,
       which, we know it isn’t. We have to preach Divine healing for everybody, yet we know it isn’t.
       See? Jesus come to save those who was in the Book of Redemption before the foundation of the
       world. He only come to save those. Who they are, I don’t know. See? But you…Nobody can have
       faith unless you say it’s for whosoever; and it is, nobody can come unless God has called
       them. That is true. So there is many people that won’t be saved. We know about it. They, well,
       God knew that before the world began, that they wouldn’t be saved.
       
        I asked one preacher, “When did you get the Baptism?” I never fused with any preacher, he
       fused with me. I don’t fuss! But when you call me and talk about the word of God, I’m not gonna
       be mealy mouth about it. I’m gonna drive down what I believe, with a sledge hammer. Then
       when the word of God starts gettin to hot then they say, “Well you’re getting mad now!” Like
       one guy heard me preach. They asked him said, “How did you like his preaching?” He said, “I
       liked it until he got mad!”
        Not mad brother, but we’re dealing with eternal life!
       AND THE DEVIL’S AFTER YOUR SOUL! And if he can blind you and get you to believe his
       lie, he’s got you! And I’ll say it and I will say it until I leave the earth! The biggest lie the devil
       ever told you was that. “You had the Baptism of the Holy Ghost!” I’m hear to tell you this
       morning, you didn’t get it!
        Let me tell you what the prophet of God said, “There’s no denominational, no independents,
       HAD ANY LIFE TO GIVE YOU! WHATEVER THEY HAD WAS HYBRID, IT WAS A
       HYBRID RELIGION!” They had some truth mixed with the lie of the devil! Don’t tell me,
       that’s what saved you!

       84 You know, I always enjoy a high-bred horse. You know, he has got sense. You can—you can
       teach him things, do things for him, and he’ll learn. But you take an old mule, you can’t do
       nothing to him. He’s just a big old long-eared donkey. He sits there, and, you could talk to him,
       he’ll stick his ears out, and, “Huh? Huh? Huh?” See, that, he’s just a hybrid. 85 Puts in mind, a
       lot of these so-called Christians, hybrid, donkey religion. You tell them Jesus Christ the same
       yesterday, today, and forever; say, “I don’t believe It.” See? And so you can’t never teach him
       nothing. How can you teach him; he’s gone, anyhow. “My church believes It this way. Mine
       believes It that way.” But God’s Word says He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever! I like
       not a hybrid Christian. 86 I like a—like a pedigreed horse. He knows who his papa was, who
       his mama was, who his grandpa and grandma was. He knows all the generations all the way
       back. 87 So does a pedigreed Christian, he knows Who his Father is. He come from God; He
       is the Word of God, He’s the same as He ever was. He’s a real pedigreed product of God, the
       Word of God is in him, Jesus Christ manifesting Himself. 88 Bunch of unbelievers! Jesus
       
       17
       wanted to shake off a bunch of parasites one day, He had too many following Him. He had
       His disciples. Then, He had the seventy, the ministerial association. Then, He had the
       congregation, by the thousands. And then He made this statement, He said, “Except you eat
       the Blood…eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.”

       That’s the way it is by the Holy Ghost. If God can ever get you still long enough to put a brand
       on you (Hallelujah.), seal you into the Body of Christ by the Holy Ghost, you know where you
       belong. 66 We’re living in a great day of hybreeding. I was reading a piece in “Reader’s
       Digest” not long ago, this hybrid stuff. I was coming down, I seen it said, “Hybrid corn,” great
       big corn, fine ears. It’s no good. It ain’t worth nothing. It’s a damage to you. Hybrid beef,
       hybrid; everything’s hybrid, hybrid, hybrid. It’s no good. Take your hybrid corn, try to plant it
       over again, see what you get. It’s no good. Even they got hybrid religion today too. That’s right.
       That’s true. They took it at a denominational confession instead of a Holy Ghost experience:
       hybreeding. What does hybrid does? Makes a better looking ear, but it ain’t got no life in it.
       That’s the way it makes a better looking church, but no life in it: hybrid. That’s right. 67
       Science disprove their own, or prove their own theology, that man came from a single cell, by
       doing it. He can’t evolute hisself up higher and higher, because as soon as he once crossed his
       breed he’s done right there. You take a mule. A mule is the most ignorant thing there is. I always
       felt sorry for him. There he stands. And look, he—he don’t know who his papa, mama was. His
       mama was a horse, and his daddy was a jack. So he don’t know who he was. He don’t know
       whether he’s either a horse or a jack. He don’t know. He’s a crossbreed. He can never breed
       himself back. He’s finished. Like some of this mule religion we got today. A mule is a—a lowest
       down thing. He will set and you say something or another, to him like that, and he will stick
       his ears out and “Haw, haw, haw.” See? He don’t even know what… There’s no gentleness to
       him. He’s just a mule. You can set and talk about God’s great signs and the Holy Ghost. Them
       old mules setting out there say, “Haw. Days of miracles is past. No such thing as the Holy
       Ghost.” You cross-breeded intellectual… I’m not getting mean, but I’m just telling you what it
       is. Oh, he don’t know who papa or mama was. 68 But oh, I like a real thoroughbreded horse.
       Oh, he’s gentle. You can teach him some sense. That… I like a real thoroughbreded Christian,
       that’s borned again of the Holy Ghost, not one was Methodist yesterday, Baptist the next day,
       and Presbyterian the next day, and something else this day, every time something goes wrong in
       the church. But a genuine Holy Ghost borned again, he knows who his ancestors was, he knows
       who his papa and mama was, he knows where he come from. He’s borned of the Spirit of God.
       Hallelujah. You can flash the Word of God upon him and quickly he sees it. Yes, sir. “Amen.”
       he says. Now, what a fine thing he is, a specimen. But all this here hybreeding…

        Your hearing it this morning, but the world is gonna hear it before it’s over! It’s Gods
       truth for the hour! I don’t care what anybody says! The Holy Ghost message, the Baptism of
       the Holy Ghost is the gospel of Jesus Christ! AND THE BRIDEGROOM IS COMING TO
       BACK THAT REVELATION UP! I don’t care what anybody says.
        They say, “Brother Lambert, doesn’t believe anybody’s got the Holy Ghost!” I’m getting to
       doubt it! I’m getting to doubt it more all the time. And not only that, as I told some people the
       other day, “I am getting so fanatical, that I’M DOUBTING THEIR EVEN BORN AGAIN
       NOW!”
        People trying to hang onto, SOME DENOMINATIONAL HYBRID GOSPEL! Trying to say,
       “They we’re Born again over in the denominations.” Where in the world, are you gonna find in
       the word of God for that? Where you gonna find in the word of God, “Oh, I received the Baptism
       of Holy Ghost over in the assemblies!” Oh, I received it over in, “The Church of God of
       Prophecy’s.” “I received it in the Baptist.”
        It wasn’t there, for you to receive it! IT WASN’T THERE! IT NEVER WAS THERE! The
       only time…OH, HERE IT COMES! THE ONLY TIME THAT THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
       GHOST EVER CAME TO ANY INDEPENDENT CHURCH OR ANY OF THE
       DENOMINATIONS, WAS WHEN THE PROPHET OF GOD WALKED IN WITH IT! Oh, the
       only time they ever had it! I like that, don’t you? (Amen) That makes the devil made, but I love
       it! Everything the devil is for, I’M AGAINST IT!
        You say, “Who is your brother?” He’s for the word of God! If you’re against the word of
       God, you ain’t my brother! How many say amen? (Amen)
        I say the only time the church world ever seen the baptism of the Holy Ghost, is when the
       prophet of God walked in with it. AND THEY SAID, “WE’VE NEVER SEEN IT ON THIS
       FASHION BEFORE!” WHY? BECAUSE THE BLIND SAW AND THE LAME WALKED
       AND THE DEAD WE’RE RAISED! WHY? BECAUSE OF THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
       GHOST! GLORY TO GOD! IT’S THE LIFE GIVER TO THE WORD!

       together in that kind of a Power, has the Power to bind the heavens, heal the sick, open the
       eyes of the blind, hallelujah, the deaf speak…the dumb speak, and the deaf hear, the cripples

       The reason why, that you don’t see these great things the early church done and what William
       Branham done and the people followed him, is because they do not have Baptism of the Holy
       Ghost. Do you believe it? (Amen) How many want the true baptism of the Holy Ghost? Then

       18 He said, “Do not fear.” When that voice spoke, I knew it was the same One. He looked at me;
       His eyes looked upon me kindly. Not to look sympathizing with this Angel, but that… Said, “Do
       not fear.” Said, “I’m sent from the Presence of God to tell you that you were born a peculiar
       birth, and your peculiar life has been to indicate, that you’re to take the gift of Divine healing to
       the people of the world.” I said, “Sir, I’m uneducated. I couldn’t go.” He said, “If you’ll get
       them to believe you, and if you’re sincere when you pray, nothing shall stand before your prayer,
       if you’ll get them to believe you.” And I said, “I bet they wouldn’t believe me, Sir.” He said,
       “You’ll be given two signs as the prophet Moses was given two signs, to get the people to
       believe you is the really the issue.” He said, “One of them was detecting diseases just by holding
       the person’s right hand in your left.” He said, “Then if you’ll be sincere, it shall come to pass
       that you’ll tell the very secrets of their hearts, and the things that they are doing wrong, to build
       the faith in the people to be in faith and to vindicate you that I—God will send it to you.”
        Now what did Moses do? Down in Egypt was the people of God. Is that true? (Amen) And it
       was Gods plan to get Gods people out of Egypt. Was they his church in Egypt? No, they was his
       people. Now how was God gonna get his people out of Egypt? He told Abraham, that they’ll be
       down there for about four hundred years, through them church ages there. He said, “Then I’ll by
       my mighty hand bring them out! I’m gonna bring them out of there and bring them over here, in
       the promise land.”
       
       20
        Now everybody wants to tell me, “That they we’re already in the promise land the Baptism of
       the Holy Ghost, when Moses come down into Egypt. Then when they heard Moses they come
       out of Egypt and went over into the promise land.”
       That’s twice confused and confounded. They had never seen the promise land. They knew
       nothing hardly about the promise land. Until Moses got there and told them what it was like. He
       said, “It is a good land, filled with milk and honey!” We didn’t even know what the Baptism of
       the Holy Ghost was like. Until the prophet of God got here and said, “It’s a good land flowing
       with milk and honey and every promise in the book is your when get it.”
        Oh friend, if all the people of God could come together, in one mind and one accord and
       contend for that great Baptism, that was givin to the early church, why WE COULD SHAKE
       THE WORLD with this great message!
        But what is it now? This one tore off over here now, this one tore off over here, tore Gods
       hand off, tare God’s leg off. Now there’s hardly anything left.
        But oh God, my heart yearns to see people of God come together in unity and in faith.
       Realizing that there’s only one revelation. There’s only one revelation. There’s only one Lord.
       There’s only one Baptism of the Holy Ghost.
        Now we’ve been studying last Sunday on all these wonderful things, that we’re preaching
       about here this morning, talking about.
        Stirring up your minds in the way of remembrance, that there is something wrong out here in
       this church world. Where is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ? Is it up here in Durham? Is it
       down in New Jersey? Is it down in Pennsylvania? I’d venture to say, that we believe different
       from those that are down in New Jersey. Those down in New Jersey that follow the message,
       believe different from those in Pennsylvania. We got groups in Pennsylvania split up this way,
       this group believes this and that group believes that. And all down through the county and go
       clear down to Indiana, same thing. This group believes this and that group believes that. But
       we’re all the Bride! Show it to me in the word of God? It’s not to be found. There’s only one
       revelation!
        A brother told me last week said, “Oh Brother Lambert, oh my what your preaching, oh my
       we’re gonna go just like this, I can believe my doctrine and you believe your doctrine and we’ll
       still go” I said, “NEVER, NEVER will we go like that.” The bible said, “They will see eye to eye
       and walk shoulder to shoulder and they’ll not break the ranks.”
       Oh friend, I’m tellin' you it’s late, how can people walk around in darkness, like they’re
       walking!
       Isaiah 52:8
       8 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see
       eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.
        But God’s got an Unconditional Covenant. God is dealing with an unconditional covenant to
       a selected number of people. And I believe that’s gonna be the end-time Bride of the Lord Jesus
       Christ.
        Now listen here! This ought to stir our hearts, to look in the word of God, to see whether or
       not these things I’m saying, be so. Oh, how we ought to, check the preacher out what he says.
       Don’t take it for grant it. Look in the Bible and search the tapes, see what we’re saying lines up
       with the word of God. It’s your soul! Remember if you listen to what I tell you and you believe it
       and it’s not right you’ll be lost!
       
       21
        Now notice here, we’ve been studying the believer’s security, called eternal security. We
       found out all those, that will really be in what I’m talking about…All those that are really
       justified, sanctified and receive the true Baptism of the Holy Ghost, is gonna make up the Bride
       of Christ. And these are Gods gifts to Christ, before the foundation of the world.
        You never just actually accidently fell into this thing, or you wasn’t talked into it. You never
       come into it, because of a mother or a brother, sister aunt or uncle, or because of some preacher!
       You we’re elected, before the foundation of the world. And you we’re God’s gifts to Christ. You
       we’re givin to Jesus as presents, before the foundation of the world. Is, that right? (Amen)
        The Bible said…Jesus said, “The father which gave them to me is greater than all.” See, the
       father gave them to Jesus.
       John 10:29-Reference quote:
       29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of
       my Father's hand.
        Now it’s unthinkable as we said last Sunday, that any of these gifts that we’re givin to Christ
       could be lost. So therefore, I don’t believe that you could ever, ever be born again and be lost or
       be unborn. There’s not two births, there’s only one. You can’t go into your mother womb,
       Nicodemus knew that much. He said, “Can I go back in my mother’s womb and be born again?”
       See! No, sir! Once you are ever Born Again by Faith, you can never be lost. He’ll never lose
       you.
       John 3:4-Reference quote:
       3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again,
       he cannot see the kingdom of God.
       4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second
       time into his mother's womb, and be born?
       5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,

        Notice Jesus said, “All that the father giveth me, I have lost none. Save one the Son of Judas”
       John 17:12
       12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have
       kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
        And we’re gonna take care of Judas, either tonight or next Sunday night or next Sunday
       morning. I’ll prove to you that he was never Justified. He was never Sanctified! Course I know
       and many say, “Now your saying something that Brother Branham never said.” Brother Branham
       can only say what the word of God said. I’ve heard Brother Branham say many things, to make
       his point. But still to pin it down, it wasn’t true wasn’t scriptural. Now I’m not saying it, then
       people say, “Oh now there’s a preacher now that’s saying that Brother Branham’s off the word.”
       
       22
       No! Just like Brother Branham said, “Well there’s four hundred that never bowed a knee” It
       wasn’t four hundred, it was seven thousand.” The whole church got in a…Everybody wrote a
       note and the whole church thought that they knew more than Brother Branham, because he made
       a mistake.

       things to me. I was told that…And I certainly want to apologize. Is the tapes on? Tape is on? I
       want to apologize to my minister brethren and to you people here. They say, the other night when
       I was speaking of—of Elijah, at that hour of when they was…He thought he was the only one was
       going to be in the Rapture, or he only one going to be saved. I—I said seven hundred instead of
       seven thousand. Is that right? [Congregation says, “Yes.”—Ed.] Well, I’m sure sorry of that,
       folks. I—I—I knowed better than that. It was just simply a mumble of speech, because I knowed it
       was seven thousand. I just didn’t say it right. I…And I—I thank you. And that means that…I’m
       glad that you’re watching what I say. And you see, then, that’s…Cause, it, it’s—it’s seven
       thousand. 18 I got two or three notes on it, that said, “Brother Branham, I believe you were
       mistaken.” It said, “Wasn’t they seven thousand instead of seven hundred?” 19 I thought,
       “Surely I didn’t say seven hundred.” See? That, and then I…Billy… 20 And then I, first thing you
       know, I picked up another note. It said, “Brother Branham, you was…I believe you said seven
       hundred.” 21 And one person said, “Brother Branham, was that a—a spiritual vision that—that
       there is just going to be a type, and you’re typing it with the seven…?” Puts people on edge
       when you go to thinking these things, see. And it’s enough, that, it puts me on the edge. 22
       Something happened today when this Seal was revealed, that I had to walk completely out in

       you’re laying right onto what I say. And God is going to hold me responsible for what I tell you.
       See? And so I—I must absolutely be as sure as all sure can be sure, see, of these things, because
       this is a—a tremendous time that we’re living in. Yeah.
        I heard people say, “You believe that Brother Branham was infallible, don’t you?” I thought
       oh boy, I don’t want to answer this! I said, “No I don’t! No sir, there is no man infallible! No sir,
       I believe the infallible God was in Brother Branham”
       And I believe that God’s revelation that God gave Brother Branham is infallible. I believe

        Number one, brother Branham said that, “Judas was Justified” He wasn’t! He said, “Judas
       was sanctified” He wasn’t! He said, “Judas went out and worked miracles” The word
       Justification means you never did sin. And the Bible said, “That he was the devil from the
       beginning.” Now what are you gonna do with that? Was he Justified?

       276 Now watch. Judas Iscariot was justified by faith, and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and
       was baptized.
       Justification: Definition-Reference quote:
       In Christian theology, justification is God's act of removing the guilt and penalty of sin while
       at the same time making a sinner righteous through Christ's atoning sacrifice.
       John 8:34
       44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer
       from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
       speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
        I was justified before the world was ever created. And I was sanctified, before the world was
       ever created. I was Baptized with the Holy Ghost before the world was spoke into existence.
       Was Judas? If we look into the word of God, we’d find out about some of these things.
        Brother Branham also said, that the foolish virgins was justified! Brother Branham also said,
       “The foolish virgins was sanctified.” But he also said, “When the seals we’re open that they
       we’re dirty and unclean.” They wasn’t justified and they wasn’t sanctified! So, you can take
       brother Branham’s message and make it say, anything you want it to say!

       systems that have taken His Name only to corrupt its brilliance and crush them along with the
       antichrist. All the wicked, the atheists, the agnostics, the modernists, the liberals, will all be
       there. Death, hell, and the grave will be there. Yes they will. For when He comes, the books will
       be opened. That is when even the lukewarm church and the five foolish virgins will appear. He
       will separate the sheep from the goats. When He comes He will take over the kingdom, for it is
       His, and with Him will be the thousands times ten thousands, His Bride, who come to minister to

        You say, “What does it mount to Brother Bob?” My sheep know my Voice and another they

       you stay in! You wanna believe you already got it? You’ll find something, to say you already got
       it. If you want to find the truth, if your hungering for truth, you’ll find it!
        We find out the father asked the son, “to ask of me and I shall give thee” The father said to
       Jesus, “If you asked for the heathen for thine inheritance, I would give thee.”
       Psalms 2:8
       8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
       the earth for thy possession.
       Heathen- Definition: Reference:
       a person who does not belong to a widely-held religion (especially one who is not a Christian,
       Jew, or Muslim) as regarded by those who do.
       Pagan, infidel, idolater, idolatress, unbeliever, agnostic, sceptic, heretic, nullifidian
        Now it’s unthinkable that if we we’re gifts to the son by the father spirit that we could ever be
       lost friend. We can’t be lost, see. Jesus said, “All that the father giveth me…”
        Now I’m adding a few words, but I’m quoting scripture. But I’ll take two or three scriptures
       and paraphrase them together to make a picture out of it.
        Jesus said, “All that the father gave me as gifts before the foundation of the world, shall come
       to me.” In the end-time by my voice, the revealed word of God. And those elected gifts that
       we’re givin to me by the father, before the foundation of the world. When they come to me he
       said, the only reason they can come to me is because the spirit is drawing them. And the spirit
       knows which ones names is on the book. So, he comes to draw them to me! Now when they are
       drawn to me by the spirit, I will in nowise cast them out. Now that’s pretty well secure, ain’t it?
       John 6:37
       37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise
       cast out.
        I don’t believe any of us are gonna be lost because God’s not an, Indian giver. God’s not
       gonna give you to Christ then turn around and say, “I lost them Jesus, I’m sorry!” Somebody
       here said, “Never!”
        Now notice, these gifts we’re the fathers before he gave them to the son. Jesus said, “Thine
       they we’re and thou gavest them me.” Now they we’re yours father…
       All right now, just for a minute! Where we’re you and I, before we we’re gave to Jesus? I mean
       before we we’re gave to Christ? I said it the wrong way! There’s a right way to say it! Jesus had
       a beginning but Christ never did! Now where we’re we before we we’re givin to Christ? Well,
       the Bible said, we we’re with the father. Jesus said, “Before you gave them to me, they we’re
       yours Lord.”
       John 17:6- Reference quote:
       6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they
       were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
       
       26
        I never did belong to the devil! I never was a child of the devil.
       People said, “I was a child of the devil, before the Lord saved me!” No, you we’re not! If you
       we’re a child of the devil, before Jesus saved you, then you’re still a child of the devil. That’s
       right! (Brother Lambert chuckles) No sir!
        Jesus said, “Before you gave them to me father, thine they we’re yours!” “Thine they we’re,
       yours Lord.” Well, how we’re we with the father? Where was we at, how we’re we with the
       father? Well, Christ was in the father! Christ was in the father and they we’re one. So therefore,
       before we we’re givin to Christ, we we’re in the father! How many believe they we’re in the
       father?
        So therefore, the Bible said, “In the beginning” Now what was the beginning? The beginning
       began when God became Christ! That was the beginning. The Lord spirit Elohim became Christ.
       True? (Amen) Then Christ created all things, the world and everything Christ did. Then as
       Christ…the Bible said, “In the Beginning was the word and the word was with God. Come on
       now! In the beginning was the word, that was the beginning. And that word was Christ! Not
       Jesus, Jesus ain’t born yet, but Christ! And what is Christ? Christ is the anointed word! In the
       beginning was the word, and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was
       made flesh!
       John 1:1- Reference quote:
       1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
       John 1:14- Reference quote:

       04 “If ye abide in Me, and My Word abides in you, then ask what you will.” Saint John 15. We
       know that’s true. Look, “If ye abide,” not in and out, in and out, but, “if ye abide in Me,” and He
       is the Word, “and It abides in you, then just ask what you will and it shall be given unto you. Ye
       shall have it.” 305 “He that receiveth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has already
       passed from death to Life.” But can you receive the Word, first? Can you receive the Word, all
       the Word, all of Christ? Christ is the anointed Word. He is the Word, anointed. 306 Christ
       means “the anointed One,” the anointed Word for that day, made manifest, the Saviour, the
       Redeemer. That’s when He was to come, and He was that anointed Person to take that place.

       is that true? (Amen) And then just as God became Christ became the word, and the word was
       made flesh and dwelt among us, now we by pass that part of it, to come down here in sin to be

       down here and take on a sinful body a sinful flesh. WHAT! So, the word can be manifested! If

       65-0221E - Who Is This Melchisedec?
       William Marrion Branham
       68 Now, the different between Him and you, as a son. See, He was, at the beginning, the Word,
       an en morphe body. He came in and lived in that, in the Person of Melchisedec. Then, later, we
       never heard no more of Melchisedec, because He became Jesus Christ. Melchisedec was the
       Priest, but He became Jesus Christ. Now, you bypassed that. Because, in that form, He knowed
       all things, and you have never been able to know that yet. You come like Adam, like me, you
       became from the attribute to the flesh, to be tempted. But when this life is finished here, “If this
       earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting.” That’s where we go; that is the
       Word. Then we can look back and see what we done. Now we don’t understand it. We have never
       become the Word; we’ve just become the flesh-man, not the Word. 69 But, and look, clearly
       makes it clear, you will never be the Word unless you was a thought at the beginning. That
       proves the predestination of God. See? You can’t be the Word unless you’re a thought. You
       had to be in the thinking, first. But, you see, in order to stand temptation, you had to bypass
       the theophany. You had to come down here in flesh, to be tempted by sin. And then, if you
       stand, “All the Father hath given Me will come to Me, and I’ll raise him up at the last days.”
       See, you had to be first. 70 And then, you see, He come right down, the regular line, from
       attribute to…Before the foundation of the world, his name is put on the Lamb’s Book of Life.
       Then, from that, He become the Word, the theophany, that could appear, disappear. And then He
       become flesh and returned back again, resurrected that same body in a glorified condition. But
       you bypassed the theophany and become flesh-man, to be tempted by sin. And then, “If this
       earthly tabernacle is dissolved, we have one already waiting.” We have not yet the bodies. 71
       But, look! When this body receives the Spirit of God, the immortal Life inside of you, it throws
       this body in subjection to God. Hallelujah! “He that’s born of God doth not commit sin; he
       
       28
       cannot sin.” Romans 8:1, “There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ
       Jesus; they walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” There you are. See, that throws your
       body subject. You don’t have to say, “Oh, if I could just quit drinking! If I could just…” Just get
       in Christ, and it’s all gone, see, see, because your body is subject to the Spirit. It’s no more
       subject to the things of the world; they’re dead. They are dead; your sins are buried in baptism,
       and you are a new creation in Christ. And your body, becoming subject to the Spirit, try to live a
       right kind of life.
        That’s why that I do not believe this doctrine that’s out, that it was all in Brother Branham!
       Now friend, I don’t personally…I don’t believe that there’s anybody spiritually speaking, that
       could love the prophet any more than I do! I tell the truth, I don’t say it in a bad way, but it’s
       true. But see their trying to protect the prophet.
        I heard one great preacher say, “Brother Branham was the last manifestation of the Holy
       Ghost that you’ll see!” I don’t believe that!
        I believe that if you we’re a son of God before the foundation of the world, and if Christ had
       to be made flesh to be manifested, then if you we’re in God as Christ was in God then you’ll
       have to be manifested! In order to prove that you we’re with the father before the foundation of
       the world.
        That’s why I believe, these signs shall follow them that believe. That proves that you we’re
       with him before the foundation of the world. How many want to prove it? (Amen)

       William Marrion Branham
       111 Now God in this last days promised that He would show, the wicked and adulterous
       generation, the sign of His resurrection, that He is not dead. He is alive. He keeps every Word,
       He lives it right through you. “A little while and the world will see Me no more,” said Jesus,
       “yet ye shall see Me,” see, talking to the believer, “for I,” I is a personal pronoun, “I will be
       with you, even in you, unto the end of the world, the consummation.” And the works, Saint
       John 14:12, “He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also.” Same works!
       “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever,” Hebrews 13:8. 112 Now the church has
       come up through the—the score of the church ages, after the first, Ephesian Church Age, in the
       Bible. And if the Lord willing, before I leave here, I want to preach on a little subject called The
       Countdown, and see how we have come, how we’ve progressed. Now notice now on the—the
       Ephesian Church Age and those church ages, until it went into the Dark Age of a thousand years
       of darkness. And then Luther, being the first reformer, he come out with justification; here come
       Wesley, with sanctification; here come the Pentecostals, with the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The
       church constantly getting into the minority, greater powers. “When the enemy comes in like a
       flood, the Spirit of God will rise a standard against it.” 113 And now we’ve left the Pentecostal
       age. Now we are coming to where like in the pyramid, not pyramid doctrines now, but I mean
       like as the pyramid. The Headstone when it comes to fit, it’s got to be honed. There’s got to be
       a ministry in the Church, the true Church of the living God, to where when the Headstone
       comes, Christ, or the ministry of Christ, and Christ will fit right in together perfectly. Then
       that brings back the Redeemed, to take the whole House of God to Glory; the Methodist,
       Baptist, and Presbyterian, through the great reformation ages, that come out and gave their lives
       
       29
       in persecutions and things for the Kingdom of God. But that Stone is coming. Yes, sir. It
       certainly will come. God will send It. It’ll fit all the Building together upon it. See? Now we see
       these signs, as we see the ministry from Christ beginning to narrow up now, to the complete
       ministry of Christ, in the fulness of the Holy Spirit. 114 Under Luther it was same Holy Spirit,
       justification; then sanctification under Wesley; the messages; then the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
       making three. Three, not three steps of grace, but three stations, I might call it. 115 Notice like
       this. When a baby is born, there is three things that constitutes its birth. The first thing in normal
       birth…You adults listen close now; the young children will never catch it. But, let’s see, the first
       thing in a normal birth is water, then blood, then life. See? 116 Now that’s the same thing that
       constitutes the new birth; water, Blood, Spirit. The elements that came from His body is what
       makes His Body. See? It come from His body, is the material that takes to—to make His Bride.
       Because, Adam had his bride taken from his body. Christ has His Bride taken from the body.
       And when Christ died, there was three elements that came from His body; water, Blood, Spirit;
       justification through believing, water; sanctification through the Blood; the baptism of the
       Holy Spirit. 117 Now this last great step must come into the perfection, that the Holy Spirit has
       to live in that Church so perfectly, it’ll make the Head and the Body unite together. See? See?
       That’s the Body. He is the Head in the Body. Now we find that He promised, in these last days,
       that that would be done. We find it.
       
        All right! The word was made flesh, now we’ve got to be made flesh. Now we’re made sinful
       flesh. That’s not the flesh that he’s speaking of. The Word has got to be made flesh in us now.
       See, when the word is made flesh in us, then it proves that we we’re with him before the
       foundation of the world.
       How many understands what I’m talking about? (Amen)
       What is it see, then see we are manifested as a true son and daughter of God.
        Now we we’re gifts to Christ before the foundation of the world, see. Then we we’re justified,
       sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost glorified, all before the foundation of the world. But there is
       a practical application, of you acting those things out here on earth. Now I believe, just as sure as
       you sit there this morning, you are a believer…I believe you are a believer, I want to be a
       believer. Then potentially…Let’s say it right. Potentially we are baptized with the Holy Ghost in
       Christ, Potentially! But as far as being made flesh and manifest those things, we can’t do it!
        Now I’d be an ignoramus on the word of God if I said, “Now here we are here this morning,
       sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus! You know that you’re not! Some of you hardly had
       enough of Gods spirit to hardly get out of bed and want to come to service this morning! Come
       on! If it wasn’t for saving face, you could of rolled back over and went back to sleep. And it’s
       that way all over the country!
        And then get up and say, “Oh glory to God, we got perfect faith!” “I’m justified, sanctified
       and sealed and ready to go. Got perfect faith, hallelujah I’m ready to go” Now, you know better!
       You know better! You have doubts, whether your goin at all.

       79 And I believe we’re on the border land tonight. I was wondering about all my meetings and
       things, how I had to cancel them out. I truly believe, before the Church can have the Rapture, it’s
       got to have rapturing faith. We can’t even have faith for Divine healing, let alone rapturing
       faith. Got to have a faith that’ll change and quicken this body, and be taken away. I believe
       there’s a Church on its road tonight, a Power of the living God, that men will speak the Word
       here and there, and it’ll flash like lightning. And a Church is coming out; not a psychologist,
       not some of this put-on, make-belief; but a real, true, genuine, anointed, Holy Ghost, called-out
       Church! Amen.
        But we can get up like a little rooster on a box and say. “Hallelujah I’m a rooster!” Yeah, until
       they said, “That’s thirty-two cents a pound.” Ugh hah! All the crowing stops.
        When we get to look in the word of God and see what a Christian is, then the crowing dies
       down.
        Brother Branham said, “Yeah, that’s right, we got just enough spirit of God to quit our
       stealing, quit our lying and quit our cussing. But we ain’t got enough of the spirit of God to make
       the word live.
        Brother Branham said, “Either the word of God will be made manifested or you are a dead

       shined across, and you’ve set in this tabernacle, you’ve listened to tapes, and yet the Spirit has
       never quickened you till you could follow the Word of God, that you women and you men could
       obey every Word that He’s written! Oh, that’s a dangerous thing. What if you would be a dead
       seed, no Life in you? But there is something in you, that tells you, “I—I want to rise, this
       morning. I want to rise from the state that I’m in. I don’t want to be just a dead seed, be left to

       31 And that’s about the way our churches has got, just took in a bunch under cold formal
       profession, some mystic dance or some sensation. And what do they do? Disbelieve the Word, till
       we got just a nest full of rotten eggs. It’s time to clean the nest and start over again. Until they
       come in contact with the Male, Christ Jesus, and get borned again of the Word. Then they got
       
       31
       to hatch, because it’s Life.
       Now we know that every seed bringeth it forth of its kind. Now if we we’re seeds of God before
       the foundation of the world and we we’re gifts to Christ, then the very same way that you seen
       Christ act, that the way your gonna act. Now, how many want to get it like that? (Amen) Every
       seed after its kind!
        Now notice here! We want… I want to believe that I’m that, see you do, we all do. We we’re
       all in Christ before the foundation of the world. And now to prove that we we’re with him before
       the foundation of the world we except his word in this end-time. To become the word born
       Bride. And the only way that you can become the word born bride, is to have been the word
       before the world was ever created.
        People say, “Oh glory to God we got the Bible now, the bible has now come into existence
       we got it.” The Bible, was always! This Bible was always here. The Bible is God! Oh, if we
       could only get a revelation of that! “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall never
       pass away!” Why? The reason it won’t pass away, is because it never had a beginning. The word
       is God! Oh, if you could really believe that! Oh see, why then read anything else, then honey!
       Matthew 24:35- Reference quote:
       35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
       Throw out all those dirty nasty magazines out of the house and all that stuff it ain’t life, true
       magazine, whatever it is! It’s nothing worth reading!
        Heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away. Now the only reason it
       will never pass away is because it never had a beginning, it’s God. Now neither will the word
       pass away, and the word is the only thing that’s secure and eternal. Then if we’re gonna pass
       away then we we’re never the word. But because we we’re the word, we’ll never pass away.
       How many believe that?
        Now that will get rid of the sister that said down south testifying, “I’m justified, sanctified
       filled with the holy ghost and got a mind to go on. But oh, glory to God, pray for me saints! The
       devil fought me all day, my husband’s mad at me, my children’s run off from home. And I’m
       going through such I trial with the devil, I don’t know whether if I can hang on or not.”
        It’s not us hanging on! See! It’s him hanging onto us. The only reason you’re here this
       morning is because he’s hanging onto you. Well, you say, “I think I’ll leave!” You can’t! Well,
       you say, “Your making me mad!” You’ll come back tonight and be a better Christian.
        Oh, I think it’s awful, the preachers are so scared they’re gonna make somebody mad. Jesus
       said, “They that love my word, nothing shall offend them.” See!
       Psalm 119:165- Reference quote:
       165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.
       Matthew 11:6- Reference quote:
       6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
        Oh, it’s just wonderful, it’s secure. We’re not holding on, he’s holding onto us. Now see, all
       those that we’re with God before the foundation of the world, are God’s gifts to Christ. Now not
       a one of them can be lost.

        So, now why am I bringing this the last two Sunday’s, is so you’ll settle down. See some of
       you go along and you stumble and fall on your face and mash your mouth and bust your nose.
       “Well, I’m gonna give up!” “Oh my, I’m just gonna give up I just ain’t called” “There ain’t no
       hope for me.” Now how many gets like that? (Amen) “I don’t know whether, if I’m gonna make
       it or not!” “I can’t do this and I can’t do that, I’m just a mess.” Now see, God never said that
       though. See!
        Are you looking at yourself? Are you trying to work your way? Are you trying by some
       merits or praying so much or reading the word so much or just living in perfection? Are you
       trying to save yourself? Then you better go join the salvation army! Go on down and join the
       salvation army! Or go on down and be Jehovah Witness, try to witness! You can’t witness that
       way! (Brother Lambert Chuckles)
        A man came to a brother’s door, that was a Jehovah Witness. And the brother said, “Well
       witness!” He said, “Well, I am Jehovah Witness!” Then the brother said, “Well, then witness!”
       He said, “Sir, you miss understand me, I am a Jehovah witness!” Then the brother said, “Well, if
       you are a Jehovah witness, I want to see you witness. Jesus said, “Ye shall be my witnesses.”
       Well, the poor person left there, still confused. (Brother Lambert chuckles)
        Well now, if your hanging on and you don’t think that you can make it… Like my brother
       said, “Brother Bob, I don’t know whether if I’m good enough! I don’t know whether or not, I can
       quit smoking.” I said, “Well, Quit smoking, quit drinking, quit running around on your wife, quit
       listening to rock in roll music. Then quit all that, quit all that! And live true to your wife! Quit
       drinking! Quit smoking! Then work and give all your money to the poor and then give your body
       to be burned and you’ll still be lost and go to hell! But No! I said, “Now, come on and except
       Christ! You’ll quit your smoking and you’ll quit your drinking, you’ll quit your running around.”
       Don’t tell me, I seen a many of them come in here and sit down still sucking on a cigarette and
       don’t suck on them no more.” How many say amen to that? (Amen)
        Nah, Jesus said through James 1:18 said, “Ye are begotten through the word of truth, by his
       will” By his own will, he begot us! Not by your will!
       James 1:18- Reference quote:
       18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his
       creatures.
        It’s not him that runneth. “It’s not him that willeth or him that runneth, but of God that

       16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
       
        You are saved by the Grace of God! See that’s where my congregation is, and that’s why the
       Lord let me bring this, see. You hear me preach all these things, I do! I preach without
       holiness…And all these things. But you see, you hear me get on sermon…Sometimes I preach
       and you get so edified and say, “Oh Lord I’m gonna make it, Praise the Lord” Then you leave
       here with your little heals up in the air! Then you come back that night, then I cut you clear down
       to the ground, then you say, “Oh there ain’t nobody gonna be saved, in this congregation!” Then
       you go out and cow down all week. See!
       
       33
        Now how many want to come to a settled conclusion, that your saved or you’re not saved?
       You ether believe God or you’re not gonna believe God! How many believe you we’re with him
       before the foundation of the world? Why then Jesus said, “I’ll lose none of them.” Now is your
       word greater then Jesus? (No)
        Well you say, “Well, I know it Lord!” Jesus said you’ve not chose me!” Did you choose the
       Lord? He said, you didn’t! Oh, you say, “I’ll never get that, what he preached the other night!”
       “The brother preached such a wonderful sermon and I choose the Lord!” “And I let my dress go
       down long and I quit cutting my hair and I choose the Lord” No, you didn’t! Jesus said, “You
       never did choose me! You never did do it, but I’ve chosen you!” See! Oh, we say, “Oh Lord, I
       gave up this, I did this and I did that!” And a little later on you find out, “Lord I didn’t do
       nothing!” Didn’t do nothing! You didn’t have nothing and you didn’t do nothing! Oh, wretched
       man we are, trying to save ourselves, makin bricks, makin bricks. See! Oh no! Oh my!
        Jesus said, “You’ve not chosen me, but I’ve chosen you!” I have chosen you, now I’ve
       ordained you to act just like I act! Bring forth the same fruit that I brought forth. I’ve ordained
       you to do it! Every seed after its kind! It can’t fail!
       John 15:16-Reference quote:
       16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring
       forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my
       name, he may give it you.
        This word of God has got to being forth an Apostolic Church, it’s got to bring forth another
       outpouring of the Holy Ghost! It can’t fail! Can it fail? (No) Why? It can’t! Because Gods word
       will never pass away.

       61 And it isn’t changed any, today, because the Holy Spirit is forerunning the Coming of the
       Lord Jesus. And as the Holy Spirit begins to stretch out across the earth, revival fires are broken
       out, everywhere, great signs and wonders has been done, healings has took place, prophecies
       has went forth. All the gathering of the apostolic blessings has come back to the Church again.
       So, as it was then, so is it now, the spirit of the unbeliever still cries out, “Who is This?”

       64-0620E - God Has A Provided Lamb
       William Marrion Branham
       145 These few nights that I’ve been trying, with all my heart, to get you to see something, that
       He is giving His last sign to the church, before He turns to the Jews. The Gentile Bride is to be
       called. 146 [Someone speaks in another tongue, and then gives an interpretation—Ed.] Amen.
       Now if I understand right, while you’re praying, the Holy Spirit speaking and then giving the
       interpretation, God giving you an invitation. 147 How many in here would like for God’s
       provided Lamb to open your eyes, so you can see Him here now, present? Would you raise your
       hand, say, “God, open my blinded eyes. Let me have my veil took off of my heart, Lord, that I
       
       34
       might understand.” 148 And now how will He be known? How will we know Him? By His
       nature, what He does, His works. He said, “I am the vine, ye are the branches.” Now, the branch
       bears the fruit, not the vine. The vine energizes the branch. And if the branch ever brings forth,
       or a vine brings forth a branch, it has grapes on it; the next vine comes out, or branch out of that
       vine, will have grapes on it. If the first church that come off of that vine, was a pentecostal
       church, with all the gifts, if that ever really puts out another branch, they’ll write another
       Book of Acts behind it. And that’s what they had in the days of the apostles, and the apostolic
       age never ended. 149 Peter said, on the Day of Pentecost, “Repent, every one of you, and be
       baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, you shall receive the gift of the
       Holy Ghost. For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to them that’s far off, even as
       many as the Lord our God shall call.” And as long as God is still calling, the apostolic age still
       goes on. “For the promise,” the promise like it was then, “is to you, and to your children, them
       that’s far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” 150 Lord, open our eyes, and let us
       see that provided Lamb. You promised that the…that You would reveal Yourself in the last
       days, like You did at Sodom, when the Son of man was being revealed. We pray, God, that
       You’ll grant it now. We are Your subjects, Lord. We are Your vines. 151 We’re not worthy,
       we’re not worthy to ask for anything; but if we would think about that, then we would be so
       little, we would be so no good. But, Lord, when I look up There and see there is a Lamb
       provided for me, there is a Lamb provided, then God doesn’t see me, He sees my Lamb. And I
       know there is nothing wrong with that Lamb. It’s already received.
        Jesus said, “No man can come to me, except the spirit draws him.” All the spirit draws and
       comes to me, I will in no wise cast out.”
        John 6:44-Reference quote:
       44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him

       Is the father greater than you? (Amen) Jesus said, “My father has you in his hand, has these gifts
       in his hand. They’re in the father’s hand, you’re in the father’s hand. Has he got the biggest
       strongest hand in the world? (Amen) Is his hands stronger than the devils hand? Is his hand
       stronger than your hand? Then he says, “I got you in there and there is no man, is able to take
       you out of there.”
       John 10:29- Reference quote:
       29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of
       my Father's hand.
        Oh, but you say, “I’ll squeeze out between his fingers.” Oh God, help yeah! “I’ll just crawl
       out, I just know I will!” God is there any hope, for that wretched man? Come out of your
       unbelief, have faith in God! “All that the father giveth me, shall come!” “And him that come to
       
       35
       me, I will in no wise cast them out!” I got them in my hand and they’re gonna stay there. I
       BEGIN A GOOD WORK IN HIM AND I’M GONNA PREFORM IT! God will present us
       blameless, before the father in that day!
       I’m gonna stand blameless, perfect before the father in that day! How many say, amen? (Amen)
       Sure that’s secure! Have faith in God!

        A lot of us are just like the little disciples on the boat, and the devil and got in the Sea of
       Galilee and the ole white caps begin to come up, fifteen twenty foot high. And the little ole boat
       was about to go under. And there was Jesus…A lot of difference in Jesus, then the apostles at
       that time. Jesus, he knew that he was with the father before the foundation of the world! He knew
       that! He saw himself in the word of God, he was a man of faith! He was God, but he was a man
       of faith. And the devil go in the storm and was sinking the boat, and it was water logged and was
       about to go under and Jesus went right on sleeping on a pillow. Brother, he was asleep on God’s
       eternal predestinated purpose for his life! He wasn’t worried about a thing, because he knew
       there was nothing that could anything to him that God didn’t allow. And he just laid in the boat
       sleeping and everybody else was frantic and ready to drown. Till they could stand it no longer!
       They said in the boat, “He don’t care a thing for us! Here he knows the boat… He ain’t asleep,
       he’s just putting on! He knows that this boat is gonna go down! And here we’ve left all of our
       boats and fishing business and here we are ready to drown in the very sea that was paying all of
       our bills and everything and here he’s laying up there in the boat. What’s the matter with him?
       Don’t he care for us? Don’t he care a thing about us?” Peter was so frustrated and upset he had
       enough of it! And went up there and kicked Jesus’s feet! He said, “Jesus! Don’t you care a thing
       about us? Don’t you know that this boat is sinking and its water logged? We’re everyone gonna
       drown! You said, “You loved us! You gonna let us drown? You that raised Lazarus from the
       dead! Are you gonna let us drown here today?” Hmm! Jesus got up and walked over there, the
       boat rocking and reeling and all water logged and ready to go under. He walked up there and
       said, “Peace be still” All the waves went down, and Peter looked at the calmness of the Sea
       Galilee and they looked at one another with tears dripping down their face! Said, “Never was a
       man like this! What manner of man, is this? That even the winds and the waves obey him!”
       
       36
        Oh MY! IT WAS A MAN THAT KNEW WHERE HE COME FROM AND WHAT HE
       WAS HERE FOR! GOD GIVE US A CHURCH LIKE THAT THIS MORNING! THAT
       KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM AND KNOW WHAT THEY’RE HERE FOR! AND
       THAT IS TO DO THEIR FATHERS BUSINESS, HALLELUJAH! THAT EVEN THE WINDS
       AND THE WAVES AND EVERYTHING THAT THE DEVIL’S GOT IS SUBJECT TO THE
       CHURCH OF Jesus Christ!
        No wonder he said, “Oh ye of little faith!” Have faith in God! Oh my, how can anything harm
       us! The first little sickness comes along the devil says, “You got cancer” We go into a frenzy of
       fear! Cause the doctor said, “You got cancer” SO WHAT! HE’S THE LORD THY GOD THAT
       HEALETH CANCER! The doctor said, “We cut you open and your filled with it and, you got
       three days to live!” HE’S THE LORD GOD THAT’LL RAISE ME UP, Hallelujah! See what it
       is, is fear! Fear! Have faith in God!
        Why I don’t know I just say, I believe if I’d of been there, I would of just road the storm out!
       Said, Praise God, if we drown we drown! Oh, I’d say, “I heard him the other day say, “He had to
       go back to Jerusalem” And if he said he had to go back to Jerusalem, brother this ole water
       logged boat is gonna make it, see. What was it, just fear! They hadn’t come to the place yet that
       they seen themselves in the word of God like Jesus did.
        Oh, yes he did! He said, “I come from God and I’m goin back to God and you don’t take my
       life, BECAUSE I LAY IT DOWN AND I’LL TAKE IT BACK UP AGAIN!” Hallelujah!
       Amen!
        Your gonna have to come to that place one day friend, when the ole World Council of
       Churches lead you up there to take your head off. Your gonna have to realize then when you
       walk down to that chopping block, that you come from God and your goin back to God and
       they’re not taking your life away. God is leading you up there to lay it down, so you can receive
       a martyr’s crown. Hallelujah! And you can say just like Christ did, “Cut it off! But he’ll raise it
       up again! Why? Because you see yourself in the word of God. Have faith in God congregation!
        Why, how can we go around sick and afflicted and everything and realize who we are? Oh,
       Help us Lord!
        None of us is gonna be lost, know not a one of us! The foundation of God is standing sure on
       this seal this morning! The Lord knoweth them that are his. He knows them that are his.
        Have not I chosen you twelve, I have chosen you from the beginning and I know one of you
       is the devil. See!
       John 6:70-Reference quote:
       70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
        I ain’t even got over into my mornings message.
       Now remember all these great things. Stirring up your memory, before I say a few more things
       this morning.
        Everybody wanting security, “Oh, I got to have a more secure job.” “Depressions coming,
       what will we eat, what will we ware.” “Oh, I got to have security Lord!” “Oh, my money’s
       getting low Lord, what am I gonna do?” “Oh Lord, I’m getting frantic!” “Everybody is getting
       laid off, I may be next Lord!” Well, so what! “Well, the pension plans failing!”
        Oh, you’d be surprised! I know things you think, I don’t know! You’d be surprised that
       people are worried about their pension plans. YOUR VERY ACTIONS PROVE, THAT YOU
       
       37
       DON’T BELIEVE GOD! Well, what do you care about any pension plan? I know a minister that
       tries to take out three bonds a week in United States. I wouldn’t give them a penny!
        What little bit of money I got brother, I got it hidden in my house. And it ain’t about to go
       down to the bank. That’s right! Oh, I ain’t takin my money down there. (Brother Lambert
       chuckles) Oh, I’ll put a hundred in there and that’s all you’ll find in there, too friend. I put a
       hundred dollars in there to pay the bills. They ain’t getting what few hundred dollars I got, no
       friend. I’m gonna spend that. If I don’t give to the Lord Jesus someway in the ministry, I’m
       gonna spend it. I ain’t want'in no pension plan.
        You’d be surprised! So many bonds, so many thousands of dollars in the bank and getting
       interest on it. “Oh my, if we go up there what would we ware? Where will we live, what will we
       put on?” Oh, Jesus said, “Oh ye, of little faith!”
       Matthew 8:26-Reference quote:
       26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked
       the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
        He said, “Consider the sparrows, four of them are sold for a penny a farthing, are ye not more
       value than the little sparrows. He said, “Not a one of those little sparrows, that falls to the ground
       and one that was sold for a penny not a one of them that they snare and trap, not a one of
       them…He said, “I know about every one of them” Are ye not more valuable than the little
       sparrows, and your heavenly father feedeth and careth for them. He said, “Take no thought of
       what you shall ware or what you’ll eat, or what you’ll put on or where you’ll sleep.” He said,
       “Your heavenly father knows you have need of all these things!” But seek ye first, the Seal of
       God the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then if you’ll do that, all these other things, where
       you’ll sleep, what you’ll eat, and what you’ll ware, will be added unto you.
        Now ain’t that wonderful? How many want to trust the Lord like that? (Amen)
       Matthew 6:26-Reference quote:
       26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet
       your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

       6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
       7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value
       than many sparrows.
       Matthew 10:29-Reference quote:
       29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without
       your Father.
       Matthew 6:33-34-Reference quote:
       30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into
       the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
       31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or,
       Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
       32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
       need of all these things.
       
       38
       33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added
       unto you.
       34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of
       itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
        All right, I’ll say this and say this again this morning and it’s worth repeating this morning.
       You say that, “He’s your savior” Is, that right? (Amen) Before it’s over, your gonna not only
       trust him as your Savior but divine healing…HEAR ME! Divine healing is coming out of the
       doctors’ offices and its coming back in the prayer room. You’re not only gonna trust him as your
       savior, but as your healer and as your provider. And then brother when the press comes down,
       your gonna trust him as your protector. He’s gonna have the devil back you into the corner and
       make you stand on every promise that he give you. How many want it to come? All right we’re
       gonna find out who’s a Christian before it’s over.
        How many want it to come to that place where the believers will get on one side and the
       unbelievers get on the other side. God hasten the day! Well, if I’m an unbeliever get me out of
       here Lord.
        Now this morning listen at these great gifts to Christ, I want you to see seven of the great
       things that Christ promised to this little group. Now this is the Bride of Jesus Christ, the true
       church of Jesus Christ. See, I don’t believe in two churches. I don’t believe that! I know Brother
       Branham had to teach that, but it’s not in the word! See!
        Church in the Greek means, called out. There’s only one Bride Church. One Bride church!
       And there’s only one head to that bride church. Now these are the selected gifts that we’re givin
       to Christ before the foundation of the world. That’s the ones that I want to preach to you this
       morning and believe that you are, we are.
        There is seven great “Nevers” that he promised to you. He promised to this selected group
       that was with him before the foundation of the world that they would “Never Thirst!” John 4:14
       said, “He that drinketh this water shall never thirst again.” He shall you shall never thirst, those
       that was with me before the foundation of the world, that God gave to me as gifts. He said,
       “When you come to me, you’ll never thirst!”
       John 4:14
       14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I
       shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
       
        He said in John 6:35, “He that eateth of this bread shall never hunger again” You’ll never
       thirst and you’ll never hunger, spiritually. Ain’t that wonderful?
       John 6:35
       35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and
       he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
        In other words, once you come up under this elected covenant…I want and I’m getting ready
       to day something now. See! I can’t help that it befuddles you and makes you nervous in my
       preaching is, that your mind is indoctrinated from all kinds of things that you’ve heard. See, you
       lean on experiences, see. Where I just take the word of God and do away with experiences and
       
       39
       take God at his word. Every time I’ve ever seen people lean on experiences they fail! They’ll fail
       see, but the word won’t see!
        See, this group God promised will never thirst. He’s gonna satisfy your spiritual thirst. Jesus
       said, “He that drinketh of this water shall never come heather to draw neither to thirst again.”
       The woman at the well.
        He that eat the bread from heaven, shall never hunger again. He’ll give you spiritual food in
       due season. Is, that right? (Amen) You’ll never thirst, you’ll find spiritual drink that’ll satisfy
       your thirsty soul and food that’ll feed your hungry soul. They’ll never thirst, they’ll hunger.
       And number three they’ll never be cast out.
       John 6:37-Reference quote:
       37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise
       cast out.
        Is that security? Now what do you want Job security for? So, you can eat? So, you can satisfy
       your thirst? So, if your naked you’ll have something to cloth you? So, that you’ll be protected.
       That you won’t be cast out without a job. There is no employer, that won’t lie to you! They’re
       after their own, they’ll lie to you. Course we got employers here, I don’t mean they’ll lie! But
       these ungodly degenerated people out here, will lie to you. They’ll lie to you, because they’re
       seeking their own. Seeketh their own, see. Oh, they’ll make you think… “Oh honey, I’ve got
       security now. They promised me in just thirty years, I’ll get a hundred and fifty dollars a month!”
       Oh, that’s real security now, ain’t it? And the earth is getting ready to burn as an oven. “And
       they’ll give me so much of a percentage, of this and that! Oh, ain’t that wonderful?” Ugh uh,
       then you come in one morning and they say, “Well, they cut me, its not to good, well here’s your
       little pink slip!” Then they go home and Bang!” Blow their brains out. How many have commit
       suicide in Connecticut this summer! Because they only had five years to get their pension plan
       and the company went bank erupted.
        But listen, to this security! Jesus said, “You’ll never thirst! You’ll never hunger! You’ll never
       be cast out!” And he said, “He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me, hath
       everlasting Life! And shall never, NEVER, NEVER COME TO THE JUDGEMENT! But has
       passed from death unto life!
       John 5:24
       24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
       everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
        Now we got we’ll Never thirst! Never hunger! Never be cast out! And will never come to the
       judgement! Is that security?
        Jesus said in John 11:26, said, “And they shall never die! In John 8:51 said, “They shall never
       see death.” John 10:28 said, “They shall never parish! Is, that right? (Amen)
        He said, “All who eat this bread from heaven shall live forever!” Ain’t that wonderful?
       John 11:26
       26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
       
       40
       John 8:51
       51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
       John 10:28
       28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
       them out of my hand.
       John 6:51
       51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live
       for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
       
        Now notice here, in Thessalonians 4:16 he said, “The Lord himself shall descend from heaven
       with as a shout as a Voice” What is this?
       1Thessalonians 4:16
       16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,
       and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
        Here’s the Lord coming in the end-time. Not the bread out of the denominational church upon
       the earth! But here’s the supernatural spiritual bread, coming down out of heaven with a shout!
       He said, “He shall descend from heaven with a shout” What is this? This is Gods loaf of bread
       coming down out of heaven. That a man may eat of that message of that bread and shall never
       die, never thirst, never parish, never come into condemnation, but has passed from death unto
       life. Do you believe? (Amen)
        Jesus said, “He that eateth…Listen to this scripture now! He that eateth the flesh and drinketh
       the blood of the Son of Man, hath everlasting life!” Now notice here, The Lord descends from
       heaven with a shout, as the bread from heaven as the Son of Man, that who-so-ever that eats of
       his flesh shall never die!
       John 6:53
       53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of
       man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
       John 6:50
       50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
        Now, we’re getting up here to who’s gonna get this, unconditional covenant. All these love
       gifts are predestinated to eat of this bread that come from heaven! Ain’t that wonderful? Here’s
       seven outstanding great things. Seven great, “Nevers” See!
        They are Christ’s sheep from eternity. It is Christs sacred duty now… Listen! It’s Christ the
       great shepherd sacred duty, to care for these sheep to save them and love them to the end! And
       the Bible said, “And having loved them, he loved them to the uttermost” Moffatts translation
       says, “Having loved them he loved the to the uttermost.” Ain’t that wonderful?
       
       41
        John 13:1
       Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should
       depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved
       them unto the end.
        What'cha afraid of? What'cha worried about? What’s all your anxiety and all your frettin'
       about? You’re the only people that are on earth, that’s got any security!
        Without exception, they follow this Son of Man in the end-time, this Shout this Voice this
       Son of Man. Without exception, they follow…Not that they ought to or they might! They will,
       they shall, follow. They will, eat the bread from heaven!
        These elected gifts to Christ receive eternal life…Listen! Which is God’s own Life! Once
       these gifts are drawn, to the Heavenly Father the Lord Jesus Christ, once these gifts are drawn to
       him…Then when they are drawn to him he gives them eternal life, which is Faith Life!
       Everything about God is, Faith! He gives you, a Supernatural Life which is Gods own life, Zoe
       in the Greek. Which is Gods own Life. Now how could you parish with Gods own life?

       119 And I tell you, today, friends, hear my word. There is a drawing Power, not from the
       church, not from the pastor, but from Glory, the baptism of the Holy Ghost moving down in
       that right channel, to draw up a Church! What is it? The Power of God, the access to His Life,
       Zoe. 120 “These things that I do shall you do also; greater than this shall you do.” He was
       persecuted, laughed at, made fun of, and died, and went in the grave. But He was true, He had
       the Spirit of God in Him, and God raised Him up. If we go the same way, it’s also we come out.
       Oh, hallelujah! I love Him!

       Now, if Jesus Christ was here on earth tonight in a physical body like I am… He is in the form of
       the Holy Spirit. God took His body and set it on the right—His right hand at—in glory on the
       throne, and sent the Spirit back as a covenant to the people. And we’re sealed by that Holy
       Spirit baptism which gives us a touch of God’s life in us. Zoe, the life of God in us. Now we
       become sons of God. That’s what makes you believe, no matter what…That’s God’s Word, I

       160 “And all that comes to Me, I will give them Zoe, My Own Life; will give them My Own
       Life, and they shall never perish. And I’ll raise them up at the last day.” In other words, “Every
       one that comes to Me, I’ll wrap him in Me.” Amen. “And he’ll become a part of Me. And he can
       
       42
       no more die than I can die, for I’m immortal and can’t die, and his soul is immortal and can’t
       die. And I’ll raise him up again at the last day.” Hum! Oh, my
       
        Now notice here every child of God…Well I said, I don’t believe in being born again and
       then being lost being backslid and go out in the world.
       Every Born-Again child of God that’s a gift to Christ, when they come to Christ he gives them,
       the New Birth! That’s not an experience, that’s not quiver that run down your spine. It’s not that
       you ran around the house and shout or speak in tongues, that’s not it. It’s just taking God at is
       word by a revelation, is the New Birth.

       232 Now watch. “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona,” says, which means, “son of Jona.” See?
       “Blessed art thou, for flesh and blood never revealed This to you. You never learned It from
       some school. But My Father which is in Heaven has revealed It to you.” Notice what He said to
       him, “Upon this rock…” That’s Peter, the predestinated Seed of God that had received this
       Light, and given the keys to the Kingdom. “Upon this rock of revelation of Who Jesus Christ is,”
       He is the full, manifested God. “Upon this rock…” Not a Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and Him
       being the second Person. “Upon this rock I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell will never
       shake It down, never prevail against It.” See? “I’ll build My Church upon this rock,” a
       revelation of Jesus Christ. 233 Look, Christ in you makes Him the center of Life of the
       revelation. See? Christ’s Life in you makes Him the center of the revelation. Christ, in the Bible,
       makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete
       revelation of the whole thing, see, what God is trying to do. 234 What is the new Birth then?
       You’d say, “Well, Brother Branham, what is the new Birth?” It is the revelation of Jesus
       Christ personally to you. Amen! See? Not you joined a church, you shook a hand, you done
       something different, you said a creed, you promised to live by a—a code of rules. But Christ, the
       Bible, He is the Word that was revealed to you. And no matter what anybody says, what takes
       place, it’s Christ; pastor, priest, whatever it might be. It’s Christ in you, that is the revelation
       that the Church was built upon.
        Now you say, “What does Brother Lambert believe on the New Birth?” I’m not ashamed to
       tell it. Now I don’t mean to be different. I never did believe, I don’t believe and I never did and I
       never will, I don’t teach it, I don’t believe the New Birth is the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. I
       don’t believe it’s found in God’s word.
        Course you can show me tapes, and that’s what people fight it with. Sure, I don’t mean fight.
       It’s their soul, sure they get upset. Why, of course, they do, they ought to get upset. You ought to
       get upset, if somebody is trying to poke something down your throat. But what you do is, go
       check it out with the word, see.
        Notice here, if those gifts that come to Christ, he gives them Gods own life! God’s own life
       comes into them. How can they be lost if they have Gods own life! See! And how do you receive
       Gods own life? By believing in his word.

       Well now, a man that’s got part of that… Now, Jesus said, “I give them Eternal Life.”
       “Eternal,” that word come from the word “Zoe,” the Greek word which means “the Life of
       God.” Well then, if we have the Life of God in us, the borned-again, then we have God’s Life
       in us, which makes us believe like God does, that whatever the Word says, it’ll materialize.
       See? If it says, “By His stripes we’re healed,” that settles it. God said so. And that’s when a
       man is borned of the Spirit of God, he’s a son of God, then he believes for things that’s
       impossible. He still believes it. Because why? His God is in him by the Holy Spirit and he
       believes. See? 41 Now, if he hasn’t got the Holy Spirit in there, he’s got nothing but just his
       nor… his—his mind to rest on it, so he just can’t comprehend the things of God. He doesn’t know
       them. The natural mind can’t understand the things of God; they’re foolish to him.
       
        How did Mary receive it? “Be it unto me according to thy word.” You say, “She had an
       experience, she had sensation, didn’t she?” She did? If a sensation brought her egg down then
       what you got, you got man in it. Nah, brother!
        With so many sensations in this day. What caused them all? Man had their hand in them.
       They tell you, “Oh, glory to God, there’s oil! Come here brother look at this oil, see it dripping
       down my hand here, oh Hallelujah!” Yea, he has some olive oil underneath the pulpit and poured
       himself. I got olive oil here to. What is it? I’m not saying that to be funny, it’s the truth! Do you
       know, there’s thousands of people that based their experience on that? Ten thousand times tens
       of thousands sit there and listen to those things. Spoke in tongues shout their hair down, as a
       brother said, “I collected five bobby pins last night, boy we’re all backslid, we ain’t got no
       revival, I only found five bobby pins.” See, if you didn’t shout all your hair down, you didn’t
       have a meeting see. See, then you thought you we’re all born again see. “Well, I spoke in
       tongues! I was in a room and it lit up and I had a vision and I was born again”
        And you didn’t know a thing about Gods word. The word took last place
       in your life.
        No, all these gifts that come to Christ, are givin eternal life which is Gods own life and there’s
       your New Birth.

       62-0909M - Countdown
       William Marrion Branham
       36 There’s so many things that we could speak of here. I got a list wrote down that take me two
       hours to get through it, nearly, and Scriptures to back this up, like if you want some of them here
       to back it up. Like First John 5:7, shows the natural and the spiritual birth, and so forth, “water,
       Blood, and Spirit.” And three in Heaven, “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,” these three are one.
       There are three that agree in earth, they’re not one, but they agree in one, in the earth, that’s
       “water, Blood, and Spirit.” See, “water, Blood, and Spirit,” like the natural birth type it. 37 So if
       a man sets on the thought of “just justification is all you have to have,” he’s wrong, wrong. He’s
       got to be wrong. And then if the church who believes like the many of the Pentecostals, that the
       Holy Ghost is it, “that’s all, just repent and get the Holy Ghost,” that’s still wrong, because
       
       44
       you’ve got to get sanctification in there to cleanse it before the Holy Ghost comes in. If you
       don’t, you leave out the Blood. See? And the new Birth, as people talks that the baptism of the
       Holy Ghost is the new Birth. Now, that’s wrong. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is different
       from the new Birth. The new Birth is when you’re born again. But the Holy Ghost is when
       power comes into that Birth for service. That’s exact. See? The Holy Ghost is…baptized into
       the Holy Ghost. 38 The new Birth, you have the new Birth by being believing on the Lord
       Jesus Christ. See? By having faith and accepting Him as your Saviour, that’s Birth, see,
       because you’ve passed from death unto Life. Now, if you want to back that up, take Saint John
       5:24, “He that heareth My Words and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life.”
       See, he’s got Life because he believes. And that same group had to go to Pentecost to be
       baptized with the Holy Ghost. Exact. 39 Holy Ghost is power for service. So when talk about you
       got to be born again, and applying that to the Holy Ghost, many of the Methodists and so forth
       are wrong there. It cannot. It just won’t cope through the Scripture here. You get the thing
       sideways. It’s got to take it the way the Scripture’s got it placed out here. See? And the Holy
       Spirit is a… “You shall receive the new Birth after this”? What? No. “You shall receive power,”
       Acts 1:8, “after this the Holy Ghost is come upon you.” See? And they had already believed to
       Eternal Life, and so forth, but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power. “You shall be
       witnesses unto Me after the Holy Ghost is come upon you,” because the Holy Ghost is a
       witness of the resurrection, showing that you have become an adult in Christ. 40 Now, the
       natural. All things spiritual, all happenings and so forth tap, or type the supernatural, or the—
       the natural is a type of the supernatural.

       William Marrion Branham
       232 Now watch. “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona,” says, which means, “son of Jona.” See?
       “Blessed art thou, for flesh and blood never revealed This to you. You never learned It from
       some school. But My Father which is in Heaven has revealed It to you.” Notice what He said to
       him, “Upon this rock…” That’s Peter, the predestinated Seed of God that had received this
       Light, and given the keys to the Kingdom. “Upon this rock of revelation of Who Jesus Christ
       is,” He is the full, manifested God. “Upon this rock…” Not a Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
       and Him being the second Person. “Upon this rock I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell
       will never shake It down, never prevail against It.” See? “I’ll build My Church upon this
       rock,” a revelation of Jesus Christ. 233 Look, Christ in you makes Him the center of Life of
       the revelation. See? Christ’s Life in you makes Him the center of the revelation. Christ, in the
       Bible, makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete
       revelation of the whole thing, see, what God is trying to do. 234 What is the new Birth then?
       You’d say, “Well, Brother Branham, what is the new Birth?” It is the revelation of Jesus Christ
       personally to you. Amen! See? Not you joined a church, you shook a hand, you done something
       different, you said a creed, you promised to live by a—a code of rules. But Christ, the Bible, He
       is the Word that was revealed to you. And no matter what anybody says, what takes place, it’s
       Christ; pastor, priest, whatever it might be. It’s Christ in you, that is the revelation that the
       Church was built upon.
       
       45
        Now, let it be known and let it be said, I don’t believe that the Baptism of the holy ghost
       comes at the bottom of the pyramid.
        One brother told me the other day said, “Now Brother Lambert, here’s where I differ, with
       yeah! To me, here’s what I think about it” I said, what is it brother?” He said, “I believe we got
       to start off with the Baptism of the holy ghost!” I said, “Oh I see what you mean now! In other
       words, after your perfection, virtue! Add to your fullness, godliness” (Brother Lambert,
       chuckles) Needless to say he got very quiet.
        No, you don’t start off with the Baptism of the Holy Ghost! THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
       GHOST IS POWER, COMING INTO GODS OWN LIFE TO MAKE THE WORD FLESH!
       HALLELUJAH! That’s the truth of it! And Gods coming to prove it’s the truth to! The New
       Birth is altogether different from the Baptism of the Holy Ghost.
        Now here we have, everybody here power seekers. See, the spirit in this hour is, power.
       You’re not satisfied with a two-eighty-three honey, you want a four forty-four. You want more,
       four-forty-four more and if they put six forty-four you’d buy that one to. (Brother Lambert,
       makes an engine sound) That’s what everybody wants. Isn’t that true? (Amen) And that’s just
       what all the preachers want, Power! “Boy, Glory to God look at the power in Brother Branham!”
       “Power Lord! Give me power Lord!”
        Yeah, and you ain’t got no Faith! You ain’t got no God life down in your soul! You ain’t got
       no New Birth! Come on! You ain’t got no Virtue! You ain’t got no Knowledge of the plan of
       God. You ain’t got no Temperance! You got no Patience! You go take the meeting, you don’t
       want to wait on God thirty days, forty days wait there in prayer, to see if he says, go or don’t go!
       You ain’t got Patience to wait on the promise.
        See what is it, you want power and there’s no God life down in the soul to create character!
       I’m winding around to what I want to say this morning.
        All these gifts that’s givin to Christ, here in this end-time, just where your livin, when they
       come to Christ, they are givin Gods own life! Now you can receive that, without knowing it!
       You know what I mean? You don’t have to have a quiver run down…Now, don’t get me wrong
       now! You don’t have to have shiver run down your spine and a great anointing come upon you
       or see a vision or speak in tongues. See! You can just sit there and you may think you’re a
       believer! But you’ll sit there in faith. And the Bible said, “Faith revelation cometh by hearing!”
       And then all at once, your eyes you think that you see, but you didn’t will come open to the word
       of God and then you are Born Again.
       Romans 10:17
       17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
        Oh, I know that’s hard for you to take! But it’s the truth! The prophet of God taught it! Don’t
       put that on him that he said the baptism of the holy Ghost was the New Birth! Oh, you can find
       some tapes where he said it, and I’ll show you tapes where he didn’t preach it to. Now I want to
       take what the prophet said that lines up with his word! He knew what he was saying, but you
       didn’t! If everybody knew what the prophet of God was saying, then they would all be in one
       mind and one accord! Now we got nine hundred, nine hundred, nine hundred times nine hundred,
       different interpretations to his message. Something is wrong somewhere.
        Notice here, when these gifts come to Christ in this evening time, by the bread in the
       shout…Now you’ll have to fill that all in. Coming down from heaven in the Son of Man. The
       
       46
       Son of Man is in the, Shout and the Voice that’s the Son of Man. And He said, “He that eateth of
       that flesh and drinketh the blood of that ministry of the Son of Man, Hath Ever Lasting life!
       John 6:53-Reference quote:
       53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of
       man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
       54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the
       last day.
       55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
       56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
       57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall
       live by me.
       58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are
       dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
        Now, notice here when you can eat the bread from heaven, you can never die!
       Now, how are you born again? By hearing Gods word. “He that heareth my word and believeth
       on him that sent me, hath everlasting life and I’ll raise him up in the last day.” Is that Gods
       word? (Amen) And when is that? When you receive a Revelation of the word of God, that Faith!
       Now notice, this is Gods life which is a faith life. And Listen here!
        Oh, here’s the sticker! This is what’s gonna shake the world one of these days! The blood life
       of God…Without the shedding of Blood there is no remission of your sins.
        Now it’s not the blood that dripped upon the ground. You don’t have no way to take the
       chemistry of the blood that fell from the cross and dip it down over your door post. It’s not like
       that now! There is a way to the blood now, there is a way open to the fountain of blood today and
       that’s by a Revelation of God’s word! And when you receive that word, revelation of that word
       Gods life comes down in your soul.
        You say, “Now how can you know it Brother Bob?” You’ll know when you get a revelation
       of the promise of the hour. I could stand here all morning and prove that and you know I have
       done that for years. But you couldn’t tell that all in one sermon. You’d be here all day and
       tomorrow to.
        Now this is Gods life that is givin to them as a gift. What? As a gift, I said! This life of God’s
       life Zoe, is givin to them as a gift. And this gift of God is, unmerited favor! It’s free! You did
       nothing to deserve it! So, if you didn’t do nothing to get it, how can you lose it? I mean if you
       didn’t do nothing to get it, then how can you lose it. See now, you can’t forfeit it.
        The Great Shepherd assures his sheep they shall never parish, because they have Gods own
       life! Nothing can tear them from the Shepherd’s hand, not even the devil. Neither can they jump
       out of his divine hand clasp!
        Now let me say this about the devil. I’m gonna preach about the devil, just a minute. See, so
       many of us are afraid of the devil! The first little sickness grabs a hold of you, you just go to
       pieces. You just squeal, “Oh my!” Your scared to death see. Now that’s just what the devil
       wants, to get you all scared.
        Now if you really believed you are saved, you’re not afraid to die. Now you show me people
       that’s so fearful and so afraid, I’ll show you there is somethings wrong somewhere see. The
       doctor says you got cancer.
       
       47
        The doctor told me one time, “I was supposed to be dead now.” This great doctor, took him
       hours to bring it out you know, what bad shape I was in. Told me what happen! Sure, it was a
       bad story. And then he got through he said, “Son did that scare you?” I said, “Not in the least!
       Not in the least!” I said, “It was nice talking to you doctor.” What do I care? I can’t die! To leave
       here would be a joy and a pleasure. I’m still goin on. He said, “Robert, we want to get you a
       wheel chair” And then from there a nice casket to. I ain’t got the wheel chair and the casket will
       go stay right there. I could of come home and said, “Oh Shirley, I ain’t got no ministry I’m
       gonna die, ohhh, the doctor said…!”
        Oh God, Faith! An ole serpent took a hold of ole Paul’s hand and they said, “The Gods didn’t
       get vengeance on him with the water, and now the serpents got him.” You’d be dead in six
       seconds. They said, “Perventure he must have been a murderer or some terrible man,” All them
       natives thinking that on the Island of Melita there. That ole serpent that grab ole Paul he would
       have been dead in six seconds, you know. Paul looked down there at that serpent hanging onto
       him. Devil putting all that venom in him would of killed ole Paul, in about six seconds. He just
       shook it off, and kept putting wood on the fire. You know what Paul thought when he seen
       that…This is what I believe! You know what went through his mind? He heard a Voice, “Paul
       you’ll stand before Pharaoh at Rome.” He’ll stand before that Pharaoh, in Rome. He just shook
       that snake off. Then another scripture come to him, when that ole venom went through him and
       begin to numb him and the devil said to him, “Your gonna die any way!” And what went through
       Paul’s mind said, “And they shall take up serpents” He just reached down and squashed that ole
       thing in the ground.
        Then you know what? First, they thought he as a devil! Then they said, “HE’S A GOD!” He’s
       a God come down! Boy, great divine healing broke out through the whole Island.
       What turned out, what the devil tried I’ll kill you with, turned out to be salvation for the people
       of Melita.
       Acts 28:5
       3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper
       out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
       4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among
       themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet
       vengeance suffereth not to live.
       5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
       6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they
       had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that
       he was a god.
        Oh, how many want that kind of Faith? (Amen) What is that? That’s perfect Faith. That’s
       Gods own Faith! That’s the Faith of Jesus Christ!
        Now let me show you… If we really believe that, let me show you what power is sitting in
       this church this morning. Yet we don’t have no miracles. We don’t have no wonders take place!
       Oh, thank God this one gets healed and God blesses us, sure. But I mean great apostolic signs
       and wonders. Now let me show you, what’s resident in your souls here this morning. Now do
       you see what happen to Paul there?
       
       48
        Now notice here! This is Gods own life, that you receive when your born again by the
       revealed word of God. That is the same faith life, that said, “Let there be a sun! Let there be a
       moon! Let there be an earth! That’s the same life that said that.
        Now don’t you see why, that it was easy for Jesus, realizing that he was with God and was
       God! Aren’t you God? Aren’t you God? Did not the Bible say, “They that the word of the Lord
       come to, we’re Gods! Ugh!

       190 But, God, specially upon Adam, breathed the Breath of Eternal Life, and he become an
       Eternal person with God. He had power like God. He was an amateur god. He was god of the
       earth; not God of Heaven, now. God of the earth! 191 And some day the sons of God will
       again become gods. Jesus said so. “Is not it written in your law, ‘Ye are gods’? Then if you can
       call those who He called god, who God visited, how can you condemn Me, say, when I say I’m
       the Son of God?” See? Now we’re getting into something deep. Now watch this when we drive it
       down. 192 Now, here they are. He is now a son of God, but he makes a mistake. He knows he’s
       doing wrong. Now remember, Adam was not deceived. The Bible said so. First Timothy 3.
       “Adam was not deceived, but the woman was the deceived, was in the transgression.” Adam
       walked with Eve, because it was his wife. 193 Same as Christ, not deceived by Satan, but walked
       into the death with the Bride. He went to be with the Bride, so He could redeem the Church. 194
       Adam knowed he was wrong, so he just walked out with Eve. See? But there was a lamb
       provided for them, that they were redeemed. 195 And these lambs, today, that were foreknown
       by God, and God has called, there is a Redeemer. “No man can come to Me except My Father
       draws him. And all the Father has given Me will come to Me.” That right? [Congregation says,
       “Amen.”—Ed.] So there is a provided Lamb, from the foundation of the world, where their
       names were put on the Lamb’s Book of Life. A Lamb was provided, to make a way of grace for
       every one of them to go in the resurrection, a provided Lamb; Adam’s lamb, now notice, as
       Adam had a provided lamb.
       John 10:34
       34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
       35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be
       broken;
       Psalm 82:6
       6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
        Now, one side is an antichrist and the other is true.
       Now notice here, No wonder Jesus went up there and put his little foot upon the rail of the boat,
       as Brother Branham said, “Peace be still!” Why? Because Gods own life Zoe eternal life, is a
       Faith life!
        Now, don’t you see where that Bride ought to be today? What she has got to come to before
       it’s over!
       
       49
        Is it any marvel that Brother Branham said, “The things that you see me do now, will only be
       amateur when the Lord will come in his Bride” What do you think it’s gonna do when that great
       headstone slips down upon that body of the Bride and they got that perfect faith in there? WHY!
       My brother, it’ll shake the earth! Well, you say…

       And Jesus said, ‘Have faith in God. For if you would say to this mountain, “Be moved,” and
       don’t doubt, but believe that what you say shall come to pass, you’ll have what you say.’” I said,
       “You get that?” “Yeah.” 169 “‘When you pray, believe that you receive what you ask for, ye
       shall have it.’” 170 I said, “See, we, after receiving the Spirit of God…Now, God made the
       world out of nothing. It’s just His Word. He just created. His Word is creation. So, He just
       spoke It, and the world was created. Because, It was the object in God’s mind, in His heart. He
       just spoke it, and it come into existence. He was a Creator.” I said, “Then, if we have Zoe,
       God’s Life in us, we become sons of God, and amateur creators,” I said, “ ’cause He said,
       ‘Whatever you say, believe that what you say, you shall have.’” 171 And I’ve noticed that. A lot
       of times, I’d say things that I couldn’t hardly think myself, but I’d say it, anyhow. And I come to
       find out, it did happen just that way. I’d say things I didn’t hardly didn’t mean for it to happen
       that way, but it did, anyhow, because I had said it. I thought, “Wait a minute!” 172 So, I said,
       “You see, when we speak anything, if something is anchored to us, we shouldn’t never speak it
       till we believe it. Then when we believe it, we speak it, and that creative Word goes out. It’s a

       99 Let me, before we go any farther, go back, Genesis 1:26. I’ll pick it up Wednesday. When God
       made man…Before He made man, He called Himself “El,” E-l, El; E-l-h, “Elah,” “Elohim.”
       The word means, in the Hebrew, “the self-existence,” all by Himself. Nothing existed before
       Him, He was all the existence there ever was, self-existence One! El, Elah, Elohim, means the
       “all-sufficient, all-powerful, Almighty, self-existence One.” Oh! 100 But in Genesis 2, when He
       made man, He said, “I am,” Y-a-h-u, J-u-v-u-h, Jvhu, “Jehovah.” What did it mean? “I am the
       all-existence One Who has created something off of Myself, to be a son of Mine, or a
       
       50
       temporary, or an amateur, little one of Mine.” Glory! Why? He gave man…Jehovah means
       that He gave man to be an amateur god. Because He is Father, God, and He made a man an
       amateur god, so He isn’t self-existence anymore, He exists with His family. Elah, Elah,
       Elohim. Now, now He is Jehovah. Jehovah, meaning, the “One Who exists with His family.”
       Now, God made man to be the predominate over all the earth, he had dominion. And the earth
       was man’s dominion. Is that Scripture? Then if that’s his domain, he was god over the earth. He
       could speak, and it would be so. He could speak this, and it would be so. Oh! There He is, God,
       Jehovah, the One Who once existed in self-existence, but now exists with His family, and His
       little ones with Him. There you are.
        I preached like that one time, down at Brother Ruddell’s and a bunch of people got up and
       walked out and the people said, “Boy is he messed up! Man is that preacher messed
       up! Believing that there’s gonna be a revival! My, anybody that’s got any revelation, knows that
       it’s all over!” Well, wha'cha goin on preaching for then?
        This faith life is givin to them as a gift, Unmerited Favor with God. Ain’t that wonderful! So
       you didn’t do nothing to get it. So, what'chu gonna do, to lose it?
        Now listen here! We’re much, too afraid of the devil too much, your scared of the devil. Now
       how many admit, your kinda scared of the devil? Now why should we be so scared of the devil?
       I’m a afraid the devils gonna get me. How can you be afraid the devil’s gonna get you, when he
       said he’s greater than all?
        Well, you say, “I’m afraid to go down the street, with all them women goin down the street
       naked.” What’s that got to do with you? Well you say, “I’m afraid I’ll be tempted” Yeah, but the
       Bible said that, “He was the High Priest and succour’s them that are tempted!” He succour’s
       them brother! Is that security? (Amen)
       Hebrews 2:18
       18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are
       tempted.
        No, what is it? The devil has a perverted limited power. Now listen! You ought to get a
       revelation of the power of the devil! The devil is not a creator! He’s not as powerful as you think
       he is! The devil only has a limited…I’m talking about the devil now! The devil can only be in
       one place, at one time. If the devil Lucifer…If the devil Lucifer is here in this church building
       this morning, he can’t be down in Lebanon Pennsylvania or down in Jeffersonville Indiana
       either. He’s here! How many say amen? (Amen) The devil in not omnipotent, he’s omnipresent.
       He can only be in one place at one time.
        BUT JESUS CHRIST IS OMNIPOTENT, AND HE IS OMNIPRESENT, AND HE’S
       EVERYWHERE AT THE SAME TIME. AND HE KNOWS EVERY PRAYER AND KNOWS
       EVERY THOUGHT. But the devil don’t!
        Now notice! But demons can be here, and down in Lebanon PA., and down in Jeffersonville
       Ind., and down in Arkansas and down everywhere. Demons can, billions of demons, their
       everywhere, they’re in people. Their everywhere demons are. But they carry out the orders of the
       devil Lucifer. The devil has a limited power. And that power is…He has a power… Right now,
       he has a power of Death! He has a power of death, he can take your body, to a death.
        But that, oh friend…IF YOU COULD REALIZE WHAT I’M TRYING TO SAY TO YOU! I
       BELIEVE WE ARE COMING INTO A NEVER DIE DOCTRINE! JESUS GAVE A
       
       51
       PROMISE, YOU SHALL NEVER DIE! The Bible said, “All things do not appear as put under
       him as yet” But all things will be put under him, even death!
       Hebrews 2:8
       8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under
       him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
        Because there will arise such an anointing, such a faith in this elected Bride of Christ. Such a
       supernatural powerful anointing in this Bride of Christ, such a supernatural faith, THAT IT
       WILL CONQUER DEATH! DON’T YOU REALIZE WHAT I’M TRYING TO SAY, THAT
       THEY WILL HAVE SUCH A MAMMOTH REVELATION OF GOD that it will conquer
       death! And bring the dead up out of the graves! Do you believe that? (Amen) God, it ought to set
       you on fire then. Do you believe that? (Amen) They shall never die! See, the end-time Bride gets
       total victory over the devil! TOTAL VICTORY OVER THE DEVIL! AND THAT IS YOU
       WILL NOT GO TO THE GRAVE BECAUSE YOU WILL BE VICTORIOUS OVER DEATH
       HELL AND THE GRAVE! And you will bring the seven church ages up out of the ground.
        Now you can see right now, my doctrine on that. I am not waiting or no independent… I
       don’t say things to be different, we just stand on the truth, just humbly and sincerely as we know
       how. I never did and I never will and I do not look for no personal resurrection of Malachi 4:5.
       God rest that precious, precious prophet of God, rest him up there in his rocking chair and leave
       him alone there.
        Before anybody can come up from the graves, somebody has to call them. And if he would
       come up he would be the Lord Jesus himself! Because there’s no scripture in Gods Bible for any
       one man to come up in a personal resurrection.
        Shows you what Hebrews said, “They without us they cannot be made perfect. We are not
       waiting on them, but THEY ARE WAITING ON US! WHAT’S GONNA RAISE THE FROM
       THE DEAD? WHEN THE BRIDE GETS A REVELATION OVER DEATH! THEN THE
       DEAD HAS GOT TO COME UP FROM THE GRAVES THEN! How many are seeing that?
       Don’t you see, that you’re in the process of it now?
       Hebrews 11:40
       40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made
       perfect.
        What gives you power over the devil? Revelation! There is nothing of such prevailing power
       is a revelation of God’s word! And the Bride of Christ is gonna get such a revelation of God’s
       word, Gods plan and purpose for this hour that she gets Victorious Over the Devil. The only
       power that the devil has, is the power of Death! And she takes that away from him, NOT ONLY
       FOR HERSELF, BUT SHE CALLS UP HER BROTHERS, LISTEN! THAT WENT DOWN IN
       DEFEAT BY THIER UNBELIEF! MY GOD! OH, MY THAT EXCITES MY SOUL!

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 1 - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       As I have already said, this Book (Revelation) is the consummation of the Scriptures. It is even
       placed exactly right in the canon of Scripture; at the end. Now you can know why it says that
       anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed. It is the revelation of God that will give you
       authority over the devil. And you can see why they who would add or take from it would be
       cursed. It would have to be so, for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of
       God and overcome the enemy? It is that simple. There is nothing of such prevailing power as
       the revelation of the Word. See, in verse 3 a blessing is pronounced on those who give special
       attention to this Book. I think this refers to the Old Testament custom of the priests reading the
       Word to the congregation in the morning. You see, many could not read so the priest had to read
       to them. As long as it was the Word, the blessing was there. It didn’t matter if it was read or
       heard. “The time is at hand.” The time was not at hand previously. In the wisdom and economy
       of God this mighty revelation (though fully known to God) could not come forth hitherto. Thus
       we immediately learn a principle — the revelation of God for each age can come in that age
       only, and at a specific time. Look at the history of Israel. The revelation of God to Moses came
       only at a specific time of history, and even more specifically it came as the people cried unto
       God. Jesus, Himself, came at the fulness of time, He being the complete Revelation of the
       Godhead. And in this age (Laodicean) the revelation of God will come in its due time. It will
       not falter, neither will it be premature. Think on this and heed it well, for we are in the endtime today.
        The devils has had the victory over every saint of God! But now they’re waiting there in
       mourning, THAT THIS LITTLE BRIDE IS GONNA COME TO A PLACE OF FAITH
       THAT THEY’RE GONNA GET VICTORY OVER DEATH ITSELF! There’ll come a call
       through the body of Christ, they’ll call the dead out of the graves! For the Bible said, “FOR
       ALL THAT ARE IN THE GRAVES SHALL HEAR HIS VOICE AND THEY THAT
       HEAR SHALL LIVE!”
       John 5:28
       28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear
       his voice,
        They go around and say, “It’s all over”, it’s just begun! They say, “The bloods off the mercy
       seat when the seals we’re open, nobody else can be saved it’s all over, it’s just wait now!” That’s
       a lie! Brother, it just begun when the seals we’re opened. They say, “You can’t preach nothing
       it’s all been preached!” Only half of it was told!
        I know that gets you! But it was! Did you ever see a covenant in the sky? Did you ever see a
       rainbow? You only saw half of it! You say, “I saw all of it!” You did? You never did either, you
       saw half of it! The other half of it is under the Seven Seal! And God is gonna tell that to! Why,
       he could be tellin it and nobody would know about it.
        Brother Branham said, “The message of Seven Seal just crossed the earth. He said there
       would be a fanatic message go forth.” “How will the rapture take place; a fanatic message go
       forth and some preacher goes somewhere and be gone.”

       378 Think! Everything will move just as common as it can be. A fanatic Message will go by,
       and, the first thing you know, something, “This minister, going somewhere, he never come
       back. He probably went to the woods, a hunting. He just never returned no more. And this
       fellow went somewhere. You know what happened? I believe, that young girl, she—she must
       have been caught away somewhere, you know, somebody take that girl out and ravish her,
       probably throwed her in the river. She was with nobody.” Half of it…ninety-nine out of
       every…May say one out of every hundred million will ever know anything about it; see, ’less
       somebody that’s acquainted with her, say, “The girl is missing. Why, I can’t understand. She
       never did leave like that.” No.
        Brother Branham said, “Unless you are constantly in the word of God and in prayer you will
       not recognize the Bridegroom when HE COMES!” WHO IS THE BRIDEGROOM? THE
       REVEALED WORD! Sure, he is! And unless your God’s gift to Christ, you’re not gonna
       recognize the Bridegroom. He’ll be hid!

       113 And how will the Messiah…the people that’s believing Him know it unless they’re
       constantly in the Word, to know what He is! Daniel said, “The wise shall know; but the foolish,
       the unwise, wouldn’t know. They shall know their God.” Now, now, how He shall appear in the
       last days, is to bring the people back to the Word, so that the Bride will know Her Husband,
       know Her Mate, the revealed Word. That’s why this has to happen.
        Now I’m talking about some things now, I tell yeah! Oh friend, when I think about it, of what
       a great hour this is!
        The devil only has a limited amount of power and that’s death! And that’s gonna be taken
       away from him in a little bit.
        CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT LITTLE BRIDE, WHEN SHE RAISES UP WITH THAT
       ANOINTING ON THAT WORD! BOY, SHE’LL CONQUER THE DEVIL, LIKE “GRANT
       TOOK RICHMOND”. SHE’LL WALK OVER CANCER, BLINDNESS, LAMENESS,
       CREATING ARMS AND LEGS AND EVERYTHING ELSE! AND THEN SUCK THE DEAD
       OUT OF THE GRAVES! OH, GOD KILL THAT UNBELIEF! OH MY, LET US HAVE
       FAITH IN GOD! Our little brothers are waiting on this Bride!
       Meaning: Like, Grant took Richmond
       (Southern words: about the civil war. Something that happens really fast!)
        Brother Branham said, When the little Bride gets a revelation of the word of God, the devil
       will be helpless before her on slot. No wonder it’s Joel’s army. She’ll conquer all of it.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 1 - The Revelation Of Jesus Christ
       William Marrion Branham
       How did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God? By faith he received
       the revelation of the blood. Cain didn’t get such a revelation (even though he had a
       commandment) so he couldn’t offer the right sacrifice. It was a revelation from God that made
       the difference and gave Abel eternal life. Now you might take what the pastor says, or what the
       seminary teaches, and though it might be taught to you with eloquence, until God reveals to you
       that Jesus is the Christ, and that it is the blood that cleanses you, and that God is your
       Saviour, you will never have eternal life. It is the Spiritual revelation that does it. Now I said
       that this Book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus and what He is doing in the churches for
       those seven ages. It is a revelation because the disciples, themselves, didn’t know these recorded
       truths. It had not been previously revealed to them. You remember that they came to Jesus in the
       Book of Acts and asked Him, “Are You at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” And
       He said, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons.” Those men were still thinking of
       Jesus having an earthly kingdom. But it was a spiritual kingdom that He was going to build.
       Even He could not tell them about His place in it, for the Father had not revealed it unto Him.
       But now after His death and resurrection, and at this particular time in His mediatorial ministry,
       He is able to set forth here in this revelation of Himself to John what His glory and presence in
       the church would mean and do. In this revelation He tells us what the end of the devil is. He tells
       how He is going to deal with the devil and cast him into the lake of fire. He reveals the end of the
       wicked ones who follow Satan. And Satan hates that. Have you ever noticed how Satan hates two
       books of the Bible more than all others? Through liberal theologians and pseudo-scientists he is
       always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation. In both of these books we find
       Satan’s origin, his awful ways and his destruction. That is why he attacks them. He hates to be
       exposed, and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is. Jesus said about Satan, “He
       has no part in Me, and I have no part in him.” The devil would like to prove that different; but he
       cannot, so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the Word. But when the church
       disbelieves Satan and believes the Spirit’s revelation of the Word, the gates of hell cannot
       prevail against her. Let me just put in a word here from my own ministry, if you don’t mind. You
       all know that this gift in my life is supernatural. It is a gift whereby the Holy Spirit is able to
       discern diseases, and the thoughts of men’s hearts, and other hidden things that only God could
       know and then reveal to me. I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when
       Satan knows he is going to be exposed. Now, it isn’t the people that I am talking about. It is that
       Satan has got a hold in their lives through sin, indifference, and disease. But you should see their
       faces. Satan knows he is going to be exposed, and the most peculiar changes come over the
       peoples’ countenances. Satan is afraid. He knows that the Spirit of God is about to let the people
       know of his works. That is why he hates these meetings so much. When names are called and
       diseases revealed, Satan hates it. Now what is this? It is not mind reading, it is not telepathy, nor
       is it witchcraft. It is a REVELATION by the Holy Ghost. That is the only way I can know it. Of
       course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost. Let me show you another
       reason why Satan hates this Book of the Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church. He knows
       that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever, and He changes not. He knows
       that a whole lot more than do ninety percent of the theologians. He knows that since God is
       immutable in His nature, then He is just as immutable in His ways. Thus Satan knows assuredly
       
       55
       that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God (Mark 16 in action) is the True
       Church that Jesus claims as His own. All else is false. It has to be. Now remember this. Christ in
       the True Church is a continuation of the Book of Acts. But the Book of Revelation shows how
       that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm, formal
       and powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works (attempted destruction of God’s people and
       the discrediting of God’s Word) right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He fights
       that. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get the TRUE REVELATION of the
       TRUE CHURCH and what she is, what she stands for and that SHE CAN DO THE
       GREATER WORKS, she will be an invincible army. If they get a true revelation of the two
       spirits within the framework of the Christian church, and by God’s Spirit discern and
       withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her. He will be as definitely
       thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over Him in the desert.
       Yes, Satan hates revelation. But we love it. With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell
       cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail over them.
        That devil is just bluff he’s bluffing you! You got Cancer, he’s bluffing you! Your gonna die,
       he’s bluffing you! Well, I believe you got this, this morning!
       You know we’re more readily receive the devils word, than Gods word. We have one sneeze, “I
       got a cold” We’ll get a pain down in our lung, “So help me, I think this cold turning into
       pneumonia.” Come on! And our children, we just fret and fuss and fume, you know! “Oh, am
       afraid, I believe you got the mumps! You got them!” “Oh, I believe I got appendicitis! You got
       it!” As your faith is, be it unto you! OH! HOW WE NEED TO RESIST THE DEVIL!
        Oh, the ole saying was from Brother Bosworth he said, “Well, let me tell you something! If
       you want to doubt anything, doubt your doubts Don’t doubt God, doubt your doubts!” So, we’re
       doubting. How many, doubt your doubts? But don’t doubt God! “By his strips, we are healed!”
       Why can’t we have more divine healing in our midst? Because we are so readily, to believe the
       devils lie.
        Well, it’s like a mailman. Brother Bosworth says it’s like the mailman, “Here comes the
       Mailman up to the believer’s door. “Good morning Mr. Lambert!” Mr. Lambert says, “Good
       morning Mr. Mailman!” Mailman says, “I got a basket of raddle snakes for you!” Mr. Lambert
       says, “Well isn’t that nice! Well, thank you Mr. Mailman!” Bring all that devil poison in your
       house, biting you everywhere. Well, where did you see them at Brother Lambert? Well, the
       Mailman brought them to me and their mine!”
       LISTEN! It’s never mine, until I receive it! It’s never mine until I receive it!
       The thing what I should of said, “Mr. Mailman, you take them raddle snakes and take them right
       back right down there, where you got them. I don’t want them! How many want to come to that
       place? Oh God! “I resist this flu devil, I ain’t got time to be sick! BY HIS STRIPS I AM
       HEALED! Oh, the devil said you got it! Well, you take it back, I don’t want it!
        I like the way Brother Branham said. He got up to come and preach a great message. He went
       down in the basement, and sat down and opened his Bible, and it was a Saturday afternoon it was
       hot and muggy. And the next thing you know he went to sleep. Then he woke up and said, “I got
       to get a message here Lord!” And he started reading, “And the Lord said” And went to sleep
       again! And then the second time he said, “Oh! My, the devil is gonna resist me that way, I must
       have something from the Lord! I went upstairs to wash my face and come back down and started
       to go to sleep again! He said, “I’ll show him!” I went out in the car and parked the car and went
       up in the mountain and walked around and come back early in the morning and walked around
       
       56
       the room and went to bed and laid down. And got up the next morning I was so sick I couldn’t
       even raise my head up! The devil said to me, “Now William Branham you know your too sick, to
       go down to the Tabernacle this morning!” He said, “Get out of my way devil, I got the message
       of the King! And I’m goin down there to.” He said, “I know more than got out of the bed and
       there he was! Now I’m gonna give this message that the devil tried to keep away from us.”
        Do you understand friend? IT’S THE DEVIL THAT GIVES US ALL THESE THINGS! WE
       NEED RESIST THE DEVIL, STEADFAST WITH THE WORD OF GOD! Oh God, hasten the
       day when we’ll bring Gods divine healing back into our assembly and back into our prayer
       closets.
        Oh, you say, “Well, we’ll get a penicillin shot, if God don’t help us the penicillin will!” I
       know it! God bless the doctors, they been needful. But God hasten the day when we won’t need
       them anymore. I’d rather have God operate on me, he don’t leave no scar no anesthetic nothing
       just does it! How many want that to come back?
        Brother Branham said, “Oh I’d like to see the church get back to divine healing! Get back to
       the powers of the Holy Ghost! Get back to these all-night prayer meetings and everything!” They
       will! Oh listen, this Great Unconditional Covenant that God gives this little bride, see how great
       it is!
        Now notice, how are we saved? We are saved by repentance… I don’t have no watch, I may
       be running over time here. How are we saved? By repentance and Faith Revelation in the word
       of God. These two factors, see are not only the accomplishment of the elected person, but are the
       gifts of God! See, we don’t repent! We don’t repent! We don’t receive our faith! In other words,
       we’re not the prime factors that repent and get the faith! See! Oh, to think of the security of God,
       see!
        Now listen here! Now listen! The Bible said in Ephesians 2:8 “For by grace are you saved
       through a revelation! And that not of yourselves!”
       Ephesians 2:8,9
       8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
       9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
        Your repentance is a gift of God! Paul also said, “Know you not that the gift of God leadeth
       thee to repentance!”
       Romans 2:4
       4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing
       that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
        The only way that you can repent and to be Born Again is, that God will give you repentance!
       And then only way that you can be saved, is that God would give you the faith to be saved.
        Now I ask you, what did you receive? Anything that you received it was givin to you of God!
       See, not knowing that the goodness of God, the good God leadeth you to repent! See, God leads
       you to repent!
        2 Timothy 2:5 said, listen to this! See, God perventure will give them repentance to the
       acknowledgment of the truth.
       
       57
       2 Timothy 2:25
       25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them
       repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
        You say, “Why don’t that brother repent?” Well, he will, when the good God gives him a gift
       of repentance. And we judge, see we judge. “Oh, I don’t think this! I believe that brother should
       of done this.” Who art thou that judgeth? Judge not, that ye be not judged. See! That’s a
       dangerous thing judging your brother.
       Romans 2:2
       Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou
       judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
       Matthew 7:1
       Judge not, that ye be not judged.
        So, we see by grace are we saved…I’m gonna hurry now. Through faith, it is a gift of God so
       why should you lose it.
        See in Romans 5:8. We’ll close in a few minutes here.
       Romans 5:8
       8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
       9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
        Watch here now! Paul wrote this. Love never faileth! Now watch this fear, now get rid of this
       fear. “Love never faileth!”
       1 Corinthians 13:8-Reference quote:
       8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they
       will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
       Now this is not said, of human love! Our love fails repeatedly. How many admit that? (Amen)
       But Paul wrote, “Love never faileth.” God’s love is different from our love. See, you love a little
       girl today and the next week, you don’t love her any more. And visa-versa girl and a boy. I here
       John say amen, he must have gone through that.
        I thought I loved two or three before I found Shirley. She ain’t here. She’d say, “Leave me
       out! You embarrass me” Well, I did! I thought I loved this little blond headed girl one time. Oh,
       thank God, I didn’t marry her! Oh, I told her I loved her, oh sure! Oh yes, “I loved you.” But It
       turned out I didn’t. There’s much changing in our love. Some men love a girl and the next thing
       they’ve hung their self and blow'd their brains out. Come on!
        But Paul said, “Love never faileth” This is not said of human love, it repeatedly fails. It’s not
       consistent. It don’t burn with an even flame. But oh, thank God, his love never fails and it always
       burns with an even flame. Aren’t you glad? (Amen) God’s love for us will never fail, see. For
       “God so loved you! See! He gave his only begotten son.”
       
       58
       John 3:16-Reference quote:
       16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
       him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
        See, a lot of people ain’t heard that scripture yet, they have memorized it for years! They
       haven’t heard it yet! Let me tell you something! “For God so loved the world” You! “That he
       gave his only, the only one son that was ever begotten by the word of truth.” He gave him to die
       at Calvary, for your sins. His only son that he ever had, that was begotten by the word of truth.
        But he’s got some more now. Now these, we don’t have to die, he’s already begotten us
       through the word of truth.
        God’s love will never fail, see! It burns with an even flame. The Bible said, “Having loved his
       own, he loved them unto the end.
       John 13:1-Reference quote:
       Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should
       depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he
       loved them unto the end.
        Watch how Gods love burns with such an even flame. DO WE REALIZE HOW MUCH
       GOD LOVES US? Why do we fear, why do we fret then, if God loves us with such a perfect
       even flame? That out of the combustion of Gods heart, he sent Christ to die for us. How can we
       doubt his love for us?
        I say this personally! If I lived ten thousand years, I’ll never forget it! Here I was a filthy,
       wicked, dirty, ungodly, unredegenerated, lousy sinner. And there I was dying in the Veterans
       Hospital and there coming home, that humble dirty kitchen there, little ole run down house.
       There stood the Lord Jesus Christ and I heard his voice! And the first words that he spoke to me
       he said, “Even though thou'est was a sinner, I loved thee and have called thee!” Friend, it
       changed my life! I didn’t even know the scriptures then. Then I found out Jesus said through
       Paul said, “While we we’re yet sinners, Christ but he died for us!” We we’re enemies to him, but
       he died for you.
       Romans 5:8-Reference quote:
       8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
       9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more,
       being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
       11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now
       received the atonement.
        Now, perventure many a man will die for his friend. But who will die for their enemy? Would
       you go over and die for a Russian that you didn’t know or a china man? Oh, you’d die for your
       friend. But Jesus honey, loved you when you was a sinner and he died for you while you we’re
       still an enemy, he went ahead and died for you. ISN’T GODS LOVE BURNING EVEN THEN!
       Then why, do we fret and fume and worry? “Having loved his own and loved them to the end”
        No wonder Paul said in Romans 8:38 “That I am neither persuaded, that neither death nor life
       or angels or principalities nor powers, nor things present or things to come, height or depth nor
       
       59
       any creature shall separate us from the Love of God, that’s in Christ Jesus our Lord!” Do you
       know anything that could separate you from it? Does he love you with a perfect love? (Amen)
       Romans 8:38
       38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
       nor things present, nor things to come,
       39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
       God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
        No wonder he said, “Ask anything in my name and I’ll do it!” “What-so-ever you bound on
       earth, I’ll bind in heaven”

       William Marrion Branham
       04 “If ye abide in Me, and My Word abides in you, then ask what you will.” Saint John 15. We
       know that’s true. Look, “If ye abide,” not in and out, in and out, but, “if ye abide in Me,” and He
       is the Word, “and It abides in you, then just ask what you will and it shall be given unto you.
       Ye shall have it.” 305 “He that receiveth My Words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has
       already passed from death to Life.” But can you receive the Word, first? Can you receive the
       Word, all the Word, all of Christ? Christ is the anointed Word. He is the Word, anointed. 306
       Christ means “the anointed One,” the anointed Word for that day, made manifest, the
       Saviour, the Redeemer. That’s when He was to come, and He was that anointed Person to take
       that place. 307 Now it’s the Holy Spirit in the last days, to shine forth the evening Lights,
       restoring back the Faith [Blank spot on tape—Ed.] that’s been trampled down, through the
       denominations; condemning the denominations and coming back to the original Faith, with
       original Bible Faith; the original Bible, believing every Word of It, not adding it and making It
       say this and say that. Just say It the way It’s said, and you want to believe it that way.

       61-0213 - And Thy Seed Shall Possess The Gate Of His Enemies
       William Marrion Branham
       20 Then God was so pleased with complete obedience. God had tried his patriarch. He had tried
       his servant. And every son that cometh to God must be what? Tried. Chastened. That’s where
       that many fall away, because we can’t stand that trial. A person come to the altar in time of
       revival. And you’ll watch just a little while, and the hot trials begin to come. Jesus plainly taught
       it, said, “The sower went forth sowing seed. Some fell by the wayside, some fell into stony
       ground, and amongst thorns and thistles, and the others fell over in good ground.” And He said
       that’s the way the Word went, goes out. Some hears the Word, go out; birds come along, pick it
       up. See, they don’t—don’t do no good at all. Others come up overnight. Oh, they’re going to do
       great things. But when the trials begin to come, it chokes them down. But some goes all the way
       over into good ground, and that brings forth a hundredfold. 21 Let’s be the hundredfolds. Let’s
       go way over, sell out everything from the world, and look to Christ, and believe Him with all of
       our hearts. That’s how these things happen. That’s how visions come. That’s how power the—of
       
       60
       God moves among us, is when we’re… No roots of bitterness, and everything’s cleaned out, and
       the Holy Spirit can work through us, then we become a channel. What if there was a short in this
       speaker tonight? You’d never be able to hear me. It’d be all full of static. You wouldn’t know
       what I was saying. Well, that’s just like we are. That’s a—that’s a mute, until something makes a
       noise in it. It cannot speak itself. And that’s the way we are. We know nothing about the
       heavenlies. But it takes the Holy Spirit to come down and use our eyes for visions, our lips for
       words and prophecies, and—and—and speak the words, and watch the things happen. “Ask
       what you will in My Name, it shall be done unto you.” See? “If ye abide in Me, and My words
       in you, ask what you will, and it’ll be done unto you. Verily I say unto you, if you say to this
       mountain, Be moved; and don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that what you have said will
       come to pass; you can have what you’ve said.” Saint Mark 11:22 and 23. Now, we know that
       those things are true. 22 Now, we find that Abraham first was tried. And after he had endured
       the trials… And what does the Bible say that we are if we cannot stand the chastisement of God?
       Then we become illegitimate children, so-called children, but not real children of God. The
       children of God knows exactly where they stand. They know where they’ve put their hope, their
       faith, their trust. Nothing will ever shake them from it. “All the Father has given Me will
       come.” That’s right. And now… “He that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out. He that
       heareth My words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, has Eternal Life, and shall never come
       into condemnation; but has passed from death unto life.” There’s the Scripture. See? Saint
       John 5:24. They believe it. They’ve accepted it. There’s something happened to them. They
       become a new creature. They’re a new nature. They’re—they’re a new being, a new creature
       there. The Greek word says “new creation.” It’s a new creation. You have been recreated again
       from what you were, to the image of a son of God and a daughter of God. It’s just such an
       awe… It’s the greatest miracle that ever happened when a sinner can be made to become a
       Christian. 23 For instance, here’s a thorn tree growing. It’s—it’s life, this thorn tree. And it’s
       got thorns all over it, and it’s got a funny looking leaf on it. Now, you see, it takes something
       besides any human work to change that thorn tree, and make them thorns go off of it, and just
       unfold, and be real pretty smooth leaves, and bear oranges. Now, you see, what would have to
       take place? You’d have to transfer the life of an orange tree into that thorn tree, and then it
       would actually bear oranges, because the life inside of it is orange. Of course, you couldn’t do
       that naturally. It won’t—it won’t cross that way. But that’s what we are. Like, we—we are now
       a—a wheat, a grain of wheat in God’s garner, when we was a cocklebur. And God changed us
       from a cocklebur to a grain of wheat. It makes the fruits different, changing your own mind, your
       own ideas. It’s the greatest miracle that ever happened, when a man or a woman is borned
       again of the Spirit of God, and becomes a new creation in Christ Jesus.

       8 And then if God has sent us to be His ambassadors, all the power that’s in Heaven, all that
       God is, all of His Angels and all of His power stands behind our words if we are correctly an
       ordained, sent messengers to the people. God has to honor the Word, for He has so solemnly
       written, that “Whatever you bind on earth, that will I bind in Heaven. Whatever you loose on
       earth, that will I loose in Heaven. And I give unto thee the keys to the Kingdom.” Oh, such
       
       61
       great promises He’s given the church!
        Oh, where’s the Bride at? Oh God! Oh, how these great signs and wonders ought to be
       prevalent among us! We ought to be healing the sick, raising the dead opening the blinded eyes
       and we ought to be way up there! And bringing the dead up out of the graves. Where are we? Off
       in some chasm somewhere.
        The Bible said this, “Perfect love of God burns with such an even flame, SHOULD CAST
       OUT ALL FEAR” All the fear that you have. There’s only one fear that’s left in there and that’s,
       you are to fear God! All the other fears you should cast out.
        In other words, if you’d would just stop for a minute, “Well, Lord I made this mistake, I ain’t
       no good Lord. There ain’t no use me going to church any more. I ain’t fit Lord!” That’s right I
       know it, you ain’t, you never will be fit, see. Oh, if you’d only realize, how God loves us. How
       his love for you burns everyday with an even flame. His love don’t burn down real low, when
       you do something you shouldn’t do. It just burns even all the time for you. Aren’t you thankful
       for the love of God that burns even.
        Today your husbands love is kinda short, for his wife. She went out and spent twenty dollars
       she shouldn’t have spent. And he got all fused up, now he don’t know whether he loves her or
       not. You come in and your biscuits are burnt and the pies burnt and the gravy’s lumpy. The
       chicken raw and the house is dirty, “Oh I thought I loved you, but I don’t know anymore.”
        That’s not Gods love. THOUGH YOU FAIL, HE FAILETH NOT! GOD’S LOVE
       BURNETH EVEN AND HOT FOR ME ALL THE TIME. Thank God, for God’s Love.
        And that perfect love…And when the ole enemy puts cancer on me and lame’s me up and it
       looks like the doctors are saying you’re gone. I lay there and think of God’s love burning even,
       as tears dripping down my face, “By his strips I’m healed, hallelujah!” And I come up out of
       there a well man.
        I remember, I used to have asthma really bad and I couldn’t breathe. That thing would attack
       me and I’d almost pass out. Not one time did I take them pills. I said, “If God called me, the
       devil can’t kill me!” He said, “You’ll do this Bob and I’ll do this with you! Even though you
       we’re a sinner I loved you, and I’m gonna use you for this and for that.” It looked like I wasn’t
       gonna have another breathe coming. And down in my heart, even though I didn’t have enough
       breathe to even coin a word with. Down in my heart beat a faith that said, “Oh I can’t die!’ The
       devil said, “You’ll be dead in five minutes, if you don’t get to the hospital!” I said, “You’re a
       liar, God said!” Boy, that asthma devil had to move off, now I breathe freely!
        What can separate us from the Love of God, principalities powers of demons? No, sir! Height
       or depth, or kingdoms whatever it is, nothing can separate us from the love of God, that’s in
       Jesus Christ our Lord. Having loved us, he loved us to the end. Now he’s in heaven making
       intersessions for you and I, a perfect mediator, that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities.
        The devil comes up and says, “Did you see what that brother did last week? Did you see what
       Bill done last week Lord, up there in Connecticut? Did you see, what Carleton McGhee done?
       Did you see what this one done and yet they claim to be a believer!” You see that father?
       He has access to the throne of God and the devil says, “Did you see what they done Lord? Great
       father God, did you see what your son and daughter did, father God, today?
        “Yes, I see what they done.” AND THEN OUR MEDIATOR, OUR ATTORNEY, OUR
       HIGH PRIEST, WHO IS THE FIRST BORN AMONG MANY BRETHREN. WHO BECOME
       OUR HIGH PRIEST, ARE INTERCESSOR, ARE ATTORNEY BEFORE A WRATHFUL
       GOD IN THE FACE OF THE PROSECUTOR THE DEVIL HIMSELF. He walks up and says,
       
       62
       “That’s right father, they did do it! But look what I did for them! LOOK WHAT I DONE FOR
       THEM!” There stands the blood! And the father looks back at the devil and says, “Sorry Mr.
       Lucifer! Case dismissed!” DO YOU FEEL SECURE THIS MORNING? (Amen) GOD’S LOVE
       BURNS WITH AN EVEN FLAME.
        I tell you when Jesus Christ went to Calvary, he knew how big your sin ticket was, both past
       present and future. He knew what your sin ticket was John, he knew what past sin that you
       committed John. HE KNEW WHAT SINS YOU WOULD COMMIT TODAY AND WHAT
       YOU WOULD DO TOMORROW. BUT HE STILL WENT TO CALVARY AND PAID THE
       FULL PRICE, for past, present, future tense. Awe, he took our transgressions and he nailed them
       to Calvary’s tree, translated us out of the power of darkness into the marvelous kingdom of Jesus
       Christ, the Kingdom of Light!
        Where I’m I gonna stop at, let me stop here somewhere.
       Do you appreciate what Christ done for us at Calvary? (Amen) Do you realize, he has givin us
       all things freely in Christ? How can the great, great power to God fail to come to the word?
       When Christ died to give you all these great marvelous things. Every promise in the book is
       ours!
        Listen here! It’s not the sin question, it’s not the sin question, it’s the son question. The

       may be.
        God is not gonna deal with a sinner for, he quit this, he quit that, he smoked this, he done
       that! Not the sin question, The Son question! You do that because you’re a sinner. God wants to
       deal with you as a sinner. He wants to change your nature, give you eternal life. Then those
       things we won’t do no more, see. See it’s not the sin question, it’s the Son question. And that
       faces the whole world. What are they gonna do in the face of Jesus Christ? What are they gonna
       do with Christ. What are they gonna do with him, see? What are you gonna do with him?
        Calvary paid the price for our sins, past present and future. Think about it now, where you
       ought to be! This is legally givin to you see, his love is burning with an even flame. Remember,
       he knew what your sin bill was before he paid it.
       Jesus’s death upon the cross sufficiently meets all Gods requirements regarding your sins, for
       both past, present and future.
        Well you say we’ll just go ahead and sin, that grace may abound. God forbid! See, once you
       see how much he loves you, you fall so much in love with him, that you wouldn’t do nothing
       wrong for nothing! But if you are to fall into something wrong, you’re so sorry broken hearted.
       
       63
       Then you come to the Lord, “Lord Jesus, look what the devil made me do, forgive me Lord!”
       See, there it is, you wouldn’t do it purposely. And if you did it at all, it’s the devil that made you
       do it, see. Talking about a child of God.
       Romans 6:15-Reference quote:
       14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
       15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
       16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye
       obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
       17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that
       form of doctrine which was delivered you.
       18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
        See, they cannot be condemned once that they are saved. For any particular sin, I don’t care
       what it is, they can’t never be condemned. This elected one I’m talking about.
       Now, I’m getting down here, to where I can close now in just a minute.
        See! All these sins have been removed from Gods view! Now see why…See, if we’re ever
       gonna do the great works the Bible spoke of in the book of Acts, we got to recognize what
       happen at Calvary. Because you got to have an atonement, to do those kind of things by. Now
       what is it? All these sins have been removed, from God’s view.
        Remember Brother Branham’s teaching on the seals, he never taught that on Justification
       before. He said, “Your sins was dipped in Gods bleach. And when a drop of ink goes down in the

       William Marrion Branham
       116 Now, oh, my! Now, the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original Owner,
       Almighty God. The title deed to the earth, and to Eternal Life, when Adam forfeited it; then
       Satan’s dirty hands could not take it, so it went back to its original Owner, God Himself. We’re
       going to find it, just in a minute. There He sits on the Throne, with it in His hand, the title deed.
       [Brother Branham claps his hands together two times—Ed.] Oh, that makes me feel religious.
       The title deed to Eternal Life, abstract title deed to Eternal Life, when Adam forfeited it for
       wisdom, instead of faith, it went back to the hands of the Owner, Almighty God. What a great
       thing! 117 All right, waiting. What’s it doing? In the hands of God, waiting for redemption
       claims. He made a way of redemption, He made a way back, and someday the Redeemer is to
       take it back. You see where we’re getting to now? We’ll watch this Fellow sitting upon the
       Throne. All right, waiting for redemption claims, its redemption. 118 What is this Book of
       Redemption, this title deed, abstract title deed? “You say, ‘abstract’?” What does an abstract
       mean? Means it’s searched all the way back to its beginning. Like that little—like that little
       drop of ink this morning, when it struck that bleach, it went all the way back. And when sin
       has been confessed and fallen into the Blood of Jesus Christ, oh, my, it gives an abstract, right
       straight back to the Creator again. You become a son of God. Abstract title deed is held in the
       hands of the Almighty. Oh, my! 119 Its redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost
       
       64
       by Adam and Eve. Oh, my! [Brother Branham claps his hands together once.] What ought that to
       do to a born-again Christian! Its legal possession to that abstract deed, title deed of Eternal Life,
       means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost. Whew! What of it, brother? The
       possession of that deed! 120 Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption. After he
       found he lost it, he had sinned and he had separated himself from God, was on this side of the
       chasm, so he could not redeem it. He just couldn’t do it, ’cause he—he needed redemption,
       hisself, so he could not do it. 121 But the law required a Kinsman Redeemer. The law of God
       required a Kinsman Redeemer. You want to mark that down, “Kinsman Redeemer,” find it in
       Leviticus 25. 122 We won’t have time to thoroughly search this, ’cause, you know, each—each
       text would make a—a night. See? 123 But God’s law received a substitute. Now, what if God had
       not offered to take a substitute? But love constrained Him to do it. That, man was without a
       way back, and there’s no way for him to get back. He was gone. But the grace of God met this
       Kinsman Redeemer in the Person of Jesus Christ. Law required it. Grace met its requirements.
       Oh, amazing grace, how sweet the sound! God’s law required an innocent substitute. 124 And
       who was innocent? Every man had been born sexual, after sex, every one. And the only one that
       wasn’t, had forfeit the rights to Eternal Life and to be king on the earth. 125 Oh, when I think of
       that Scripture, “For Thou has redeemed us back to God, and we may reign and be kings and
       priests upon the earth.” Oh, my! What? The Kinsman Redeemer! Oh, what a story we would
       have here! 126 Notice, law required a Kinsman Redeemer to redeem a lost substance. Grace
       met this requirement in the Person of Jesus Christ. A Kinsman must be born of the human
       race. 127 Now, how could we be, when every man that’s born has to…And anybody that couldn’t
       see it was a sex act there, well, he is totally blind, see, ’cause every man that was born was born
       of a woman. 128 And God required a Kinsman Redeemer, and He must be a human. Oh, my!
       What are you going to do now? Law required a Kinsman Redeemer. 129 Now, He couldn’t
       take an Angel. He had to have a man, ’cause we’re not kin to the Angel. We’re kin to one
       another. The Angel never fell. He is a different kind of a being, got a different body. He never
       sinned or nothing. He’s a different. But the law required a Kinsman Redeemer. 130 And every
       man on earth was born of a sex. Now, don’t you see, there is where it come from. That’s where
       sin started. So you see where it’s at now? There he comes, your seed of the serpent, in. See? 131
       Now, notice, required a Kinsman Redeemer. And the Redeemer, Kinsman Redeemer, must be
       born of the human race. Here, that leaves us on a limb. But let me sound the Trumpet to you.
       The virgin birth produced the—the product. Amen. The virgin birth produced our Kinsman
       Redeemer. None other but the Almighty God become Emmanuel, one of us. Emmanuel! The
       “Kinsman Redeemer” was met. You see how God makes a requirement, and there is nothing
       we can do. But then grace steps in and overshadows that law, and produces the product.
       Amen!

       65-1204 - The Rapture
       William Marrion Branham
       60 I’ve always preached that He was Deity, not just a man. He was God manifested in the flesh:
       God, the attribute of God, of love; the great attributes that come down, displayed here on earth,
       of God. Jesus was God’s love, which built a body that Jehovah Himself lived in. He was the
       fulness of the Godhead bodily. What God was, He manifested through that body. That body
       had to die, so He could wash the Bride with His—with His—with His Blood. 161 And notice,
       
       65
       not only is the Bride washed, forgiven, but She is justified. See? Did you ever try the word
       justified, to see what it means? Now, for instance, if Brother Green heard that I had been
       drinking, I been doing bad things, then he found out that I didn’t do it, then he come, say, “I
       forgive you, Brother Branham.” 162 “You forgive me? I never done it. What you forgiving me
       about?” See? But if I’m guilty, then I can be forgiven; but I’m still not just, because I did it. But
       the word justified is “though you never done it, at all.” Justified! And then the Blood of Jesus
       Christ cleanses us so from sin, till it’s put in the Book of God’s forgetfulness. He’s the only
       One can do it. 163 We can’t. We can forgive but not forget. I could forgive you, but I always
       remember you done these evil things. Then, you’re not just; you’re forgiven. But, in the sight
       of God, the Bride is justified. She never done it, in the first place. Amen. Standing there,
       married to the virtuous Son of God; never sinned, in the first place. Why? She was
       foreordained. She was trapped into this. And now when She heard the Truth and come forth,
       the Blood cleansed Her. And She stands there, virtuous. See? She, no sin on Her, at all. 164
       Therefore, the Message calls the Bride together, see, the shout. And the trumpet… The same
       One, He, with a loud voice, He screamed out with that shout and a voice, and woke Lazarus.
       With a loud voice He cried, “Lazarus, come forth.” See? And the voice wakes up—wakes up the
       sleeping Bride, the sleeping dead. 165 And the trumpet, “with the sound of a trumpet.” And,
       when it does, it calls. Always, a trumpet called Israel to the Feast of the Trumpets. See? Which,
       was a pentecostal Feast, the great Feast in the sky; and the Feast of the Trumpets. And, now, a
       trumpet do announce a calling together, “Come to the Feast.” And now that is the—the Lamb’s
       Supper in the sky. Now watch: The assembling together; and the Bride; the Feast of the
       Trumpets; the Wedding Supper. We have seen it in types. Now watch just a moment before we
       close. Notice. We seen it in types. 166 Now, if you want to read in Matthew 18:16, It said,
       “There is three that bear record,” see, in Saint…in First John 5:7, so forth. Three is always a
       witness. Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] It’s a verification, something that’s
       right. Three witnesses bear. “In the mouth of two or three witness, let every word be
       established.” 167 Now notice. We’ve had three witnesses. Three is a witness. Now, we have
       already had three raptures in the Old Testament. Did you know that? As a witness. Now watch.
       Enoch was one; Elijah was the other one; and Jesus was the other one. Jesus, being the
       Keystone, now, He bare record. See? He was the Keystone between the Old and New Testament,
       ’cause He had to first die and then rapture. He died; come to life and walked around here with
       us; and then was raptured up. Because, He was the Keystone that tied the two together. After
       His resurrection and rapture…Look. After He did that, and proved that, the Old Testament there.
       We all know Enoch was translated. We know Elijah was taken up by a whirlwind, that right, in a
       chariot of Fire. And Jesus died, buried, rose up and lived here on earth, and then was raptured
       up, the Keystone. There is three, to bear record. Is that right?
       
        Now can’t you see why, the Blood is coming over your soul now, this elected one now! The
       blood is being applied to your soul and that blood is cleansing you back into the side, into right
       fellowship with Christ. That you can stand and speak to the storms, speak to the wind, speak to
       the trees, speak to the disease, create arms and legs! Don’t you see, what God is trying to do
       children? See that’s how Brother Branham done all these great things! By the Word, by the
       Blood!

       168 And I said, “Now here is the way we believe it. Here comes along…Jesus came by, one day,
       and there was a tree standing there. And He said…He looked for a fruit, and there was no fruit,
       and He said, ‘No man eateth from thee, from…for evermore,’ went on away. And the next day,
       when they passed by, that tree was withering. Peter said…Why, you know Peter—Peter, how he
       was. He—he said, ‘Why, look at the tree! Behold it.’ And Jesus said, ‘Have faith in God. For if
       you would say to this mountain, “Be moved,” and don’t doubt, but believe that what you say
       shall come to pass, you’ll have what you say.’” I said, “You get that?” “Yeah.” 169 “‘When you
       pray, believe that you receive what you ask for, ye shall have it.’” 170 I said, “See, we, after
       receiving the Spirit of God…Now, God made the world out of nothing. It’s just His Word. He
       just created. His Word is creation. So, He just spoke It, and the world was created. Because, It
       was the object in God’s mind, in His heart. He just spoke it, and it come into existence. He was
       a Creator.” I said, “Then, if we have Zoe, God’s Life in us, we become sons of God, and
       amateur creators,” I said, “ ’cause He said, ‘Whatever you say, believe that what you say, you
       shall have.’” 171 And I’ve noticed that. A lot of times, I’d say things that I couldn’t hardly think
       myself, but I’d say it, anyhow. And I come to find out, it did happen just that way. I’d say things I
       didn’t hardly didn’t mean for it to happen that way, but it did, anyhow, because I had said it. I
       thought, “Wait a minute!” 172 So, I said, “You see, when we speak anything, if something is
       anchored to us, we shouldn’t never speak it till we believe it. Then when we believe it, we
       speak it, and that creative Word goes out. It’s a part of God, see, and It created.”

       William Marrion Branham
       466 How do you know, ’cause you’re a church member? Because, Christ is living through you,
       so pregnated with His Spirit that you—you’re a prisoner to anything else. You’re confined, oh,
       my, to the Gospel, confined to the Word, and all the children that you can bring forth is that,
       ’cause you’re a prisoner. 467 You can’t commit adultery; you’re already pregnated. Glory! He
       can’t take a hold. The womb of life is closed to anything else. You’re already His, by
       predestination. That Seed has come to Life; no world can get in. Oh! Oh, how we’d like to stay
       on this for about an hour! I’m sure you understand. See? Christ, and His alone, already
       finished. The Seed was there. The Seed was, already. When was It put there? “Before the
       
       67
       foundation of the world, has predestinated us unto Eternal Life.” And as soon as the Lifegiving flow, that Seed laying there…Other seeds that just would come in, wouldn’t take hold,
       just couldn’t do it, like. But when that Seed come in, quickly it stopped up the womb; all the
       rest of the seed was drove out, see, like that. 468 And you become a prisoner, surrounded, in
       Christ. Christ in you, His Life bringing forth His evidence, His signs. Oh, my, my, my! Look,
       bringing His signs of Life as a evident of His resurrection, proving to the world that Eternal
       Life, vindicates to the world that we’re alive in Him. And think of it, alive with God, our
       Redeemer, Who created us for the very same purpose, the Church, and His creative Life in us.
       469 That is, Moses could said, by the Word of God, “Let there come,” and there come flies. A
       God can make flies can make squirrels. See? 470 He can do whatever He wants to. He can
       create. He can do anything. He’s God. The very same God, that creative Life, you see, that’s in
       you, can…You’re a prisoner; you can’t speak it till He says speak it. But, when you spoke, it’s
       God’s Word. He’s vindicated it to be so. Everything else is right, and He knows, when that’s
       spoke, it’s got to be so. See? 471 Moses took his rod, and said, “Let there come frogs,” ’cause
       God said, “Let there come frogs.” He just transmitted it on out. That’s right. And frogs was in
       everything, everywhere was frogs. Where did they come from? Nobody knows. They wasn’t there
       before. But the Creator, God, working through a man, created things, a living species. 472 The
       very God that made the first frog can make the second frog. He makes all frogs. Oh, my! You see
       what I mean? Made the first squirrel, makes the second squirrel, make any squirrel; can make
       squirrels where there is no squirrels. He can do anything He wants to! He is God! He is God!
       His Life! Oh, my! When I think of it, makes me shiver! Uh-huh. 473 Oh, to live with Him,
       going Home with Him, to live with Him! Going Home with Him to live with Him forever,
       having Eternal Life! 474 This is God’s great mystery of love expressed, that God and man
       became one. See? The whole thing is God and man, one. God and man was one, there; and
       God and man is one, here. See? What is it? Being filled with His Spirit, Him having the
       preeminences. That was God’s achievement, that’s God purpose to do that: that He might be
       in Christ; and Christ in us; and all of us together, one. The Holy Spirit, same thing; It
       revealed it to Christ, reveals it here; the supernatural creative Power. Oh, my!
        See, its Christ died! Now if all this is all the word of God, Listen here! See now, who is he
       that condemneth? Who is he that condemneth? Who shall bring anything to the charge of God’s
       elected one? How are you gonna condemn this brother or this sister, for doing something when
       God don’t even do it. Are you greater than God, that you would judge your brother or sister?
       That’s why Jesus said, “Judge not! Judge not!” For it is Christ that died! It’s God that justifies!
        Now listen, Romans 8:29, this famous scripture. “For them he did foreknow, he also did
       predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son.”
       Romans 8:29
       For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,
       that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
        Now notice here that every one of these gifts…Now here’s the sticker! See, they don’t want
       to believe this among the people that follow Brother Branham. They say, “We believe that this
       was only for Brother Branham”
        All those that he foreknown he did predestinate, to be conformed to the very image of the
       Lord Jesus Christ. How many is gonna take that? (Amen) In other words, this end-time elected
       
       68
       Bride that’s coming up, see. They’re everyone taken into the hands of the holy Spirit, molded
       and to be made into the very image of the Lord Jesus! Now it didn’t say, just Malachi 4:5! It said
       all those gifts that are predestinated, are to be conformed to the very image of his son. How many
       want to be conformed into his image of his son? (Amen)
       Romans 8:29
       29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,

       William Marrion Branham
       360 So when you surrender your complete being, then the Holy Spirit just pours through you, in
       these virtues, then you’re a living tabernacle. Then people look out and say, “That’s a man full
       of virtue, knowledge (he believes the Word), temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness,
       full of the love of the Holy Ghost. See, there he is, walking around.” What is it? A stature that
       unbelievers can look at and say, “There is a Christian. There is a man, or a woman, who knows
       what they’re talking about. You never seen a kinder, sweeter, godlier person.” You’re sealed. A
       seal shows on both sides. Whether you’re going or coming, you see the seal just the same. There
       you are. See? When a man or woman possess this, then the Capstone comes down and seals
       them into the Kingdom of God, which is the Holy Ghost. 361 Then the Word, coming from
       Here, manifests Itself through each one of these beings, see, and makes this complete Being a
       Tabernacle of the living God, a walking, living example of Christianity. What Christ was,
       these people are, because His Life is in here. They are in Christ. And their life is dead and hid
       in Christ, through God, and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost. First Corinthians 12. That’s
       right. See? You reckon yourself dead, then you’re born of faith. Then virtue and these other
       things is added to you till you’re a perfect, living image of God. That wonderful? [Congregation
       says, “Amen.”—Ed.] 362 And then God, through that, has brought also Seven Church Ages, to
       show the seven steps that He brought, building His individual into His image, He’s built a
       complete Church in His image. And at the resurrection, this complete Body will be raised up
       to live with Him forever, because it is a Bride. See? So that cuts in every age, every age that
       come.

       64-1205 - The Identified Masterpiece Of God
       William Marrion Branham
       178 I am now identified in the baptism of the Holy Ghost; not something out here on the street,
       something forty years ago. I have it right now, the glory and power of God, of forgiveness of
       sins. I see Him heal the sick, open the blinded eyes, see Him foretell things, read the hearts of the
       people. I’m identified with Him in His ministry at this day. Glory to God! I’m identified with
       Him, for deliverance in this last days. I trust to be a part of that great Bride that’s coming some
       of these days. 179 No matter what the world may say, they may call us “crazy, hysterical, or
       Beelzebubs, or heretics,” whatever they want to be. I still want to be identified with that group.
       I’m still there. I’m remain there. I was born there. I want to stay there. I’ll always be there,
       ’cause God placed me there. I am. I left my church, to come identify myself with a bunch of holyrollers. I’m one of them. I’m identified with them. They say, “Billy, you lost your mind.” 180
       Maybe I did, but I found the mind of Christ. I found His Word, found His Presence, found that
       He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever!…care what anybody else thinks about it. This is
       me. I’m the one that has to make my identification. I’m identified with Him, by God’s Word. He
       said, “These signs shall follow them that believe.” I’m glad I’m identified in that. Yes, sir. 181
       You know, the old master violinist, one time. You’ve heard the story. They had an old violin and
       auctioned it off. They wanted to sell it, and nobody would buy it. They said, “Who will give a
       dollar? Who will give a dollar and a half?” Finally, “Going once, going twice, a dollar and a
       half.” 182 Finally an old gray-haired man stepped out of the audience. You know the story.
       Picked it up, said, “Let me have it.” Put some rosin on his bow, and struck it a few times. The
       people begin to weep. The tears began to run off their faces, like that. 183 And when they did, the
       auctioneer picked up again, said, “Who will make one,” said, “thousand dollars, two thousand,
       five thousand?” 184 What was the difference? The master, the one who knew it, the one who
       built it, he knowed how to get out of it what was in it. 185 And as long as we try to bring our
       churches out of creeds and denominations, we’ll never do it. Let the Master Builder of
       mankind, Who made man in His own image, Who is building Him a Bride for the same thing,
       let His bow stroke of the Holy Ghost strike this Word in your heart one time, and it’ll be our
       best example. No matter how many big churches you go to, and how many names is on the book,
       it’ll do more for Jesus Christ than all the churches, and denominations, and creeds, and world
       churches, and organizations, in all the world. 186 He is making a Bride. Yes, sir. He’s hewing
       the chips now, chopping off the world. Oh, church-joining, and creeds, and denominations, and
       dogmas, all has to be cut away from the Church; their formal ideas, their indifference, their
       doctrines and things. Come back and let the Master pick up the bow. Let the Master pick you
       up in His hands, strike the Word, say, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.”
       187 Say, “Amen, Lord. Make me, mold me, make me, Lord, what I should be.” Then there’ll
       be a different thing. 188 Then, “If I be lifted up from the earth, I’ll draw all men unto Me.”
       Yes, sir. 189 He is cutting you out now, cutting you down to His Word only, cutting all the
       creeds and dogmas and everything, away from you, trying to get back to a Bride for the Son,
       another masterpiece, part of the Word. The Word! 190 Jesus couldn’t take the place. You
       remember when they read that day in the book? He read just part of the prophecy, left the rest of
       
       70
       it for the last day. We’re supposed to take that part. 191 So, you see, He has cut, wants to cut
       the Church out, just like He did the Son out, like He did the Bride and the Groom. To be His
       Bride, you must be part of Him. Not part of the creed, not part of the church, not part of the
       denomination, but the part of Him. Hewed out of any other kind of a form, won’t work. You got
       to be hewed from the Word. The world cut off of you, and just leave the Word only live in you.
       192 The great Sculptor is counting on you, willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the
       likeness of His requirement that His Word requires. “In the last days I’ll pour out My Spirit
       upon all flesh. Your sons and daughters shall prophesy.” Christ is the identified Masterpiece
       of the Word made flesh. You are asked to identify yourself in Him, by the same Word, to be the
       masterpiece for the Bride. 193 Now, brethren, God had a masterpiece then, to present to the
       world, now He wants a masterpiece today. Are you willing? Are you ready, my Christian friend?
       Are you really sure that your life is so reflecting for Christ, no matter what the world says. They
       say, “You lost your mind. You gone crazy. You went and joined that bunch of holy-rollers.”
       Don’t you pay no attention to that. 194 If you’re not really truly saved, and in that Body, and the
       Word of God in you and reflecting Itself, and the Life of Christ reflecting out of you; brother,
       sister, don’t you take that chance. I don’t care what you are, what kind of an experiences you
       have, let that Word reflect through you each day, because God, in this last days, is taking a
       Bride for His Son, Jesus Christ.
        Now notice, they will be conformed to his very image. “Moreover, whom he did predestinate,
       them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he
       also glorified.”
       Romans 8:30-Reference quote:
       30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
       justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
        “Now what are we gonna say? Well, if God be for us, who can be against us!”
       Do you know anybody that could be against you then? Looks pretty secure, don’t it?
       Romans 8:31
       31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
        Now, I’m closing right here on this, for sure.
       Listen to my words, now! Weight out what I’m saying.
        This predestinated elected Bride in this end-time, is called…This group that I’m speaking
       about…Now this is a bomb-buster, if you’ve never heard it before! This predestinated elected
       ones, these gifts that we’re givin to Christ, come forth at the end of the seven church ages. This
       group that I’m speaking about, will be born on earth. Some of them may be young, or may be a
       little older, but that group of people will be on earth. This group of people that I’m speaking of,
       will be on earth at the ending of the seven-church ages. And then they will get they’re
       call…Listen now! They will get they’re call to be conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus at
       the end of the church ages, at the opening of the Seven Seal! Now hold on just a minute. Do you
       believe that? They will get they’re call! Now you can see what I’m saying, see. “Those whom he
       called, them he justified and those whom he justified, he sanctified and those that he sanctified,
       he hath already glorified”
       
       71
        Now it’s a total impossibility, for that elected one who is justified and not be sanctified and
       did not get filled with the Holy Ghost!
        But now you fit, Dr. Gram, Dr. Osborn all those great men fine brothers. God, knows in my
       heart I ain’t got a thing against them, I love them. I ain’t got a thing against them, but they’re just
       as lost as lost. Billy Gram…Hear me! I never did believe that Billy Gram was filled with the
       holy ghost, even when the prophet of God said it! Do think they would believe, if Brother
       Branham said, “Billy Gram is lost?”
        But I say what Paul said, “If our doctrine be hid, it’s hid to them that are lost!” “To the law
       and to the testimony, if they don’t speak according to This Word, The Message of the prophet
       (William Branham), they are Lost! And if an angel would come down from heaven and preach
       any other thing then this, let him be accursed.
       2 Corinthians 4:3
       3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
       Isaiah 8:20
       20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there
       is no light in them.
       Galatians 1:8
       8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
       we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
        They’ll every one… Every one of those people that was influenced with their ministry, they
       will lead them into the Mark of the Beast. They do not have any of the Holy Ghost in them.
       They’re soul is black as midnight. They are not Justified and they are not sanctified and they
       never was. Not under this covenant I’m preaching about.
        The Bible said, “Those that he justified…And the only way that you can be justified is by one
       faith, that’s spoken of to the Bride church. ONE FAITH! ONE LORD! ONE BAPTISM! ONE
       GOD THE FATHER OF ALL, THE HEAD OF ALL, THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH, THE
       HEAD OF THE BODY, Jesus Christ. And if that gospel be hid, it’s hid to who? Then they’re
       lost.
        Watch here now! This elected chosen predestinated children of God, come forth to receive
       they’re call at the end of the seven church ages at the opening of the Seven Seals! Until that time,
       they know nothing about it. They know nothing about why Gods got them on earth.
        Now, I want to read something! Now this is just one, I don’t have time to read them all. I’ll
       read you two. Is that enough? See now to show you… I can’t just can’t preach nothing that I
       can’t prove that Brother Branham said it. Not only do I need to know all the bible today! I also
       have to be a walking tape library. Which requires many years and many hours in study.
        Page six, “Stature of a Perfect Man” How many believe Brother Branham was inspired to
       preach the, “Stature of a Perfect man?” (Amen) How many believe what he said is true? (Amen)
        Now hear me! I believe Brother Branham was a fallible man. I believe he was uneducated and
       ignorant, like I am ignorant and uneducated. I make all kinds of mistakes, but the revelation Is
       perfect and that’s infallible!
        Now page six, “Stature of A Perfect Man” I’m gonna quote Brother Branham from page six,
       the Statue of a perfect man.

        Oh, God get an iron pen and burn this upon your heart. Burn it down there, cinch it, scorch it,
       write it in there this morning that it will never leave. Now let’s see, let’s just who was saved,
       let’s see who had the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Let’s see who was Justified and who was
       sanctified. I’ll make a statement that I don’t believe the Bride of Jesus Christ was Called,
       Justified Sanctified or filled with the Holy Ghost till after the Seven Church Ages was over and
       the seals we’re open! Now you can see if I’m right and what’s gonna happen to all them people
       there. Unless something comes forth from God to open the people’s eyes, we’re gonna go in the
       rapture with one in Georgia, one down here and one over there. I don’t want it to be that way. I
       would like to see multitudes, go in the rapture, I don’t want to see nobody lost. How many like to
       see multitudes go in the rapture? Nobody wants to see nobody lost. But now listen hear,
       something is wrong somewhere.
        Page six, quote Brother Branham: (Brother Lambert reads)
       62-1014M - The Stature Of A Perfect Man
       William Marrion Branham
       31 Now we are approaching The Seven Seals. We have just finished The Seven Church Ages.
       And this is a Message on teaching, that ties the man in, that’s going to be redeemed by the
       Blood of the Lord Jesus, and is going to be in that Church age, that Eternal Church age at the
       end of the Seals. Now we know that we have Seven Trumpets, Seven Plagues, Vials, and so forth,
       that we get into, as we go along. But we’re waiting for more room so the people can be seated.
        Brother Branham says, “That this message of the Stature of a Perfect man, is gonna tie the
       man in, that’s gonna be redeemed after the Church Ages, at the opening of the Seven Seals.” Yet
       people want to go on saying, “That they we’re already born again, before they ever met Brother
       Branham! They we’re already filled with the Holy Ghost and they carried all that over into the
       Bride age!” It won’t work!
        Can I read one more? I’ll prove it on another tape, “On God Keeps His Word” As far back as
       nineteen fifty-seven, Brother Branham knew this. Listen, quote Brother Branham:
       57-0120E - God Keeps His Word
       William Marrion Branham
       6 I tell you the reason I love to hear Brother Neville speak. Not mainly because he’s a good
       preacher, but because I know that he lives what he preaches. And I would rather you would live
       me a sermon than preach me one. It’ll be more effective. 7 And now I have announced, had it
       announced, that I would speak on, tonight, for a few moments: God Keeps His Word. 8 And
       this morning, I was speaking on: The Impersonation Of Christianity. 9 And, now, the Lord
       add His blessings now as we read His Word. And I want to read from several places in the
       Scripture, at least three, or maybe quote some more. Because, it’s the Word that we are
       speaking about. In the last Book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation, after the complete Bible
       had been…being finished, here was the—the message to the Church. (Bride) At the 22nd
       chapter of Revelation, and beginning with the 17th verse. Unquote!
        Can I read it? Now let’s see where this elected Bride comes in at. Let’s see what it says, your
       wondering what it is right now, aren’t you?
       
       73
       Revelation 22:17:
       17And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him
       that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely
        Come on now! Shows you that here is the call of the Bride now! Now notice here! The spirit
       says come! Well, you say, “Who’s that Brother Bob?” That’s Malachi 4:5. Now notice here!
       That there is two calls made! One is Malachi 4:5 and the other one comes through those of the
       Bride, some in the Bride. The spirit and the Bride say come! Say What? “Come out of what?
       Come out of there to get eternal life!”
        Now when did Brother Branham say it was gonna come? At the end of the Seven Church
       Ages. When the Bible is finished to the Church Ages. What was allotted to the church ages.
        Now I’m quoting. Now listen! The angel that stood in Revelation ten says, “That when this
       happens time shall be no more.”
       Revelation 10:6-Reference quote:
       6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein
       are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein,
       that there should be time no longer:
        Well, time is still goin on, isn’t it? Is time still goin on? (Amen) The prophet said, it would be
       no more. Baptist time is over! Methodist time is over! The Seven Church age time is over!
        Now watch here! When the seven seals we’re open, it closed off…It closed off that Last
       Church Ages and ended another covenant. And then when the seals we’re open, then that
       brought us into the Eighth Day, which is back to the first day, which is the Bride Age!

       William Marrion Branham
       207 One time when they killed the Prince of Peace, and put Him in the grave, and sealed up
       the tomb, and death held Him for three days and nights. But on Easter morning He had the
       scepter in His hand, and hollered, “Get away, death! Get away, grave! Open up! I am the
       King’s Message. I must come forth to prove this resurrection. I am the resurrection and Life.”
       Hallelujah! I feel real good now. It’s the King’s Message. Let’s recognize It, friends, for we are
       called to gather together for the sounding of the Trumpet. “For the Trumpet of the Lord shall
       sound, then time shall be no more.” 208 He’s gathered Israel. The three days, in the third day
       He said He would do it. Twenty-seven hundred years has passed. In that third day He said He
       would gather them together, and He’s done it. He said He’d make known the way of Life.
       There you are, just waiting now for the Bride to get out of the way so they can come, the two
       prophets, Hebrew prophets, that’ll recognize.
        Now those elected ones, are called after the opening of those Seven Seals. They come forth
       and are Justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost. And now, between that time and now
       and the days that are ahead, there has got to rise a Justified Sanctified Holy Ghost filled God
       anointed Apostolic Bride Church of Jesus Christ. Got to be, if God’s word is true!
        I ain’t got time, I was gonna read a great thing here in the Church Age Book, you read it when
       you go home. I don’t know what time it is, it feels awful late. Page one-seventy, you know the
       story, you can read it when you go home. The prophecy of the angel of the Lord. The angel of
       the Lord took Brother Branham’s and wrote a message to the Church. Apply that to, about what I
       spoke this morning.
        Now friend, do you realize…In closing, while our sisters come to the organ and piano.
       Do you realize how great the opening of those seals are?
        Now notice here in closing, Brother Branham said, “The Seven Church Age…Let God burn
       this in your heart! The seven Church Age turns down the plan to the blood” Did he say it?

       hate to say that, for I’ve never found faith in any church like the Pentecostal church. But it’s
       rejected, because it’s the Laodicean last church age, lukewarm. It’ll be spued from the mouth of

       has come to pass. This apostate organization churches is bound tighter than they ever was
       bound. They are bundled together in a federation of churches, ready for the fires of God’s
       judgment. (I never wrote this. I feel that He did it.) Pentecostals are full of, so-called, the same
       as them. The wheat-Word will be gathered some day, after They leave, for the Master’s. 430 God
       has promised…Be careful. God has promised Malachi 4 for this last day. And Malachi 4 has not
       yet as been fulfilled, but it must be fulfilled, for it is a germitized Word of God spoken through
       Malachi the prophet. Jesus referred to it. It is to be just before the Coming of Christ, the second
       time. (Listen close now.) All Scripture that has not been fulfilled, must be, before that time. The
       Bible is to be finished, to—to be finished. The Gentile dispensation is to be finished, with the
       church age, when this anointed messenger arrives. Of course, he will plant the Seed of the
       entire Bible, plumb from the serpent to the messenger in the former rain. Then he will be

       that the Pentecostals has the closest thing to It, there is, because they’re up here in the

       Why didn’t… 263 Ask you a question.
       Why didn’t all your rains, back yonder, bring the bride to Christ? I want you to answer me
       that. If…His Coming is overdue. We believe it. (Like it was in the days of Noah, longsuffering,
       He’s getting His Bride ready.) Why didn’t these rains…Why didn’t you Pentecostals back
       yonder, a few years ago, when you started, forty, fifty years ago, why didn’t you bring Christ,
       the Bridegroom, to the bride? Going to let that soak, a minute. Why? Because you pregnated
       her, yourself, with your denomination. That’s exactly what you done. He won’t marry a
       whore. He’ll marry a virgin. It’s flat, but that’s the Truth. You know It, in a flat way. You
       don’t have to wonder. I don’t stumble around about It. Tell you the Truth. Why didn’t it bring
       her? Why didn’t it bring Christ, bring Christ to her? Because she’s not fit. He found her in
       adultery. 264 Exactly the reason children don’t live forever when they’re born; Adam found
       his wife pregnated. 265 That’s the reason Jehovah had to take a Gentile Bride; found her
       pregnated. 266 That’s exactly the way Christ has to get Him a Bride now; He’s found the socalled group pregnated. He’s going to sow His Seed. Somebody is going to get It, because
       they’re predestinated to be a Church at the end of the road. 267 Like Adam and Jehovah’s, He
       found them pregnated with man-made doctrines of denominations. Like God’s Truth, in Genesis
       1, “Every seed has brought forth after its kind.” So, when the Spirit fell on her, man had been
       there to her womb, and filled it with denominational seeds of his own thinking, so that’s why she
       got to be the way she is, and Christ could not come to her. Hum! That’s hard, isn’t it?
        Now you come out of that, and now the spirit says, “Come! He that is thirsty for me let him
       come now and drink of the water of life freely! Showing you that somewhere after the ending of
       the Seventh Church Ages and after the opening of the Seven Seals that there is gonna be living
       water poured out, to satisfy the thirsty souls of the believers.
        And then from there…Now watch here, you say, “How will it be Brother Bob?” This is the
       way I believe it. Somewhere upon the earth Now, there has got to be a people that have a
       revelation, that come from the opening of the Seven Seals! Because the spirit has revealed that.
       
       77
       Then that group is gonna get an outpouring of the Holy Ghost! And then out of that group will
       come forth a cry! One more cry, one more…Yeah, I’m not ashamed to tell it! There’ll be one
       more great move of the spirit in United States, before she burns. And that will come out of the
       group that has received, what I’m talking about. There will be a revival break out somewhere, in
       United States, among a group that has a Revelation from those Seven Seals. And then the Cry
       that they will make will become, “He that is thirsty, come out of that! Come and drink of the
       water of life freely! How many want to see that come! See, “The spirit and the Bride say,
       Come!” The Bride has never said, “Come!”
        In fact, most of the bride don’t even believe there is to be an outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
       They say, “Brother Branham said, it’s all over!” See, you miss interpreted the prophet.
        It’s all over, Time Is No More, It’s all over for the Church Ages!
       But it has just begun for the Bride! So therefore, “The Spirit and the Bride say, Come out! And
       drink of the water of life freely!”
        The prophesy of Zachariah 14 said, “In the evening time it shall be light! Shall be light! The
       path to glory you’ll surely find. Is, that right? It said in Zachariah 14 and eight said, “And in that
       day, that comes light by the opening of the Seals…In that day that day that it becomes light,
       Living Waters shall flow out of the Bride. Half of to the east, and half of it to the north, half of it
       to the south and in summer and winter it shall be. Showing you that half of it goes to the Bride
       and the rest go to the Jews. Ain’t that beautiful?

       7 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it shall come to
       pass, that at evening time it shall be light. 8 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them
       toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall

       me say, that same God that was in the days gone by, that we speak so much of, He is present
       here now; not by some theological understanding, but by a personal knowledge of His
       vindication that He would pour out in this last days, the Holy Spirit upon His church. He is not
       an “I was.” He is still the “I AM,” present tense, always. 179 Then the cistern lost its taste. And
       so does every man who ever falls into the power of God, by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
       denominational systems lose their taste. You don’t want no more of that stagnated frogs, and
       lizards, and bugs, and so forth. You’re drinking from a Fountain that’s fresh and pure, the Word
       
       78
       of God, fresh every hour in your soul. The same as now, when the Word has been proven to be
       the Truth, taste and see if it’s not right. 180 Though the cistern had served its well, served its
       time well; but, you see, the Fountain of Life was there, not Jacob’s well no more, for spiritual
       drinking. What they thought, if they drank from that well, why, it would be all right; but now the
       Fountain of Life Itself was sitting there. 181 Now we don’t need systems and organizations that
       we have. We’re at the end time. And God promised, in this end time, the things that He would do.
       And we see it fulfilled, to the Word. We hear the man of military might, stand up, and shivering,
       and saying, they, “Something is fixing to happen.” We feel the Holy Spirit warning us that
       something is fixing to happen. We see everything set in order. Then, leave that system and
       come to the Fountain. Yes, sir. 182 Served its purpose, but now she was face to face with the
       Fountain Itself. 183 In John 7:37-38, Jesus said in the last days of the feast of the tabernacle
       (what did He say?), “If any man thirst, let him come to Me, and drink.” Right in a bunch of
       theologians! “If any man thirst, let him come to Me, and drink. For the Scriptures has said, out
       of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living Water.” 184 There’s the living Fountain.
       That’s the Fountain that the people has forsaken today. For the creed, they have forsaken the
       Fountain of living Water. Let me introduce you to Him. He, to me…And I’m closing.
        And to think what has happen, that God has opened up our eyes to see this glorious light.
       Now let’s offer a word of prayer.
        Dear heavenly father we’re ignorant and we’re unlearned. We’re poor in spirit Lord! And we
       gather here to do the best we can, with what thou hast givin us. We thank you for the faith that is
       beating down in our bosom today, Lord. We thank you, for the great opening of the Seals. We
       thank you Father, that we’re living at the end of theses Church Ages. Realizing Lord your calling
       your elected before the foundation of the world. You’ve elected us to be conformed in your very
       image. We believe it with all of our hearts. Help us to yield ourselves as clay to the potter, Lord.
       That you might mold us and make us, in the image of the Lord Jesus. That you might get out of
       us, the work that you have called us for! Now father God I guess it’s late, I don’t know. And
       Lord the things that I said, are so broken up and so cut up. That only the holy spirit could take
       and make anything out of it, to the people’s hearts. Won’t you bless us, all together Lord? We
       want to see you prevalent among us Lord. We want to see the great power that fell at Pentecost
       and manifested in our midst. Because we love the people, we want to see the sick healed and the
       blinded eyes open. We want to see your name glorified. Lord we want to see the great messenger
       prophet, our precious brother, Brother Branham. We want to see his message exalted and
       conquer every enemy that’s in the land today. Father you’re the only one, that can make Malachi
       4:5s message live. We ain’t got no message Lord., but he brought a message and we pray that
       you’ll make it live in our lives. Won’t you do it soon Lord? The worlds dying and its getting in
       worst shape every day Lord. More break offs more isms-scisims, just everything father. Please
       come soon! It’s not by might not by power but by thy spirit, you said that you would do it. Raise
       up a standard against the enemy and we’ll ever praise you for it. God exalt your great name.
       Bless us and help us father, forgive us of all of our shortcomings and mistakes. And Lord the
       things I Should of said, that I didn’t say. Things that I might have said a little wrong, please
       forgive me Lord, I don’t mean to. Oh, it’s so hard to try to minister today. God we’re over fed
       and under prayed, we’re so ease in Zion Lord. God have mercy upon us and help us father.
       Stimulate our faith Lord, stir us up, set us on fire. Won’t you do it father? Have mercy upon
       China and Russia and the countries around the world father. India and Africa, people’s that have
       never heard the glorious light of the gospel. Let it shine Lord, soon. In Jesus name, amen.

        Let’s stand to our feet. I’m sorry I kept you so long. I’m just such a poor minister I can’t pace
       myself very well at all. What page is that sister?
        Whatever I said, I only said to try and help you. Let’s let our faith, look up to the Lord Jesus.
       Who knows, maybe a great church could break out this morning. God could pour out his spirit.
       While we’re yet singing this hymn, Gods great awesome presence could come and pour out his
       spirit and make his word live, yet this morning.
       Congregation sings, “My Faith Looks up to Thee”
        We won’t sing the last stanza. Now I really believe with all my heart, that the little
       bride…For the scripture said, “For we shall not all sleep” Not all of us is gonna go to the ground.
       But some of us is gonna come into a never die doctrine. You’ll never die! But while you stand on
       your feet in the body that you’re now living in, you’ll be changed into immortality. God will dry
       up your blood, put a supernatural work of God on you. “How?” Now friend, yet we claim to be
       the body. We claim to be filled with the Holy Ghost, we claim to have all that. Where is that
       power that’s gonna do such a miracle? To just change you right where your standing, into
       immortality. There’s got to come forth a power of the Holy Ghost. There’ll not be one person
       come up from the graves, until there is an apostolic Pentecostal Holy Ghost filled people upon
       earth to call them up out of the graves. And I’ll go down on record on that, for I have Gods word.
       Without us they cannot do it. In fact, they’re aren’t even perfected.
       Hebrews 11:39,40
       39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
       40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made
       perfect.
        Them Church ages was never perfected and they’ve got to lay there until this Bride redeems
       them. How many want to be a redeemer? (Amen) We’ve got to redeem that fallen Church Ages.
       And what’s gonna do it? Nothing but the Holy Spirit in the word of God.
        Friend I tell you, if we really believed, all these things God said, it ought to make us the
       happiest people on the face of the earth. It looks like to me, we should get such joy about it, that
       those that are sick among us, could just stand there and to think all this is taken place while we’re
       living on earth and just walk away healed. Prayer lines and anointing with oil, should be far in
       the back ground.
        That you could realize who you are…Now here’s the way divine healing takes place for you!
       Realize who you are and that Gods love burns with an even flame, and then just look and say,
       “Lord I believe that I am your gift, from God to Christ! Now Lord, I take you at your word and
       I’m gonna walk right into my healing.” Never ask Brother Bob or nobody to pray for you, just
       stand up and take God at his word and walk right into your healing. I believe that’s what the
       brides coming to. Oh, just realize who you are, see.
        Now just chores of, “Amazing Grace.” While we’re dismissed. While the sisters play it real
       softly. Now how are you gonna be here friend…How are you gonna be in this great number? By
       grace are you saved through faith. See, forget all that, oh you made a mistake ask God to forgive
       you, “Lord help me, I’m trusting you! You’ve begin a work in me, now finish it Lord.” Yield
       yourself to that, believe it and have faith in God! Realize what he done for you at Calvary and
       take advantage of it, see. Won’t you, do it? How many is gonna try to live above all that human
       
       80
       outs and ups and downs? Children look in the word of God and see who you are. Now if Jesus
       looked in there and saw himself, you’ve got to, too.
        Now I’d like to ask Sr. Graybill to dismiss the congregation. If you come back tonight, I’ll try
       not to hold you too long. We’re gonna have communion tonight. Come back, and sing to the
       Lord with all your heart and all your soul and all your might. Thank him and praise him for
       saving you by his grace. Won’t you, do it? Brother Graybill.
       Congregation sings: “Amazing Grace”
        God, bless you! You may be dismissed and may God shine upon your pathway.

        Amen, glory to God. You may be seated. We have another opportunity to stand our post of
       duty tonight. Waiting for that glorious coming of the Lord Jesus, to marry his little Bride. The
       invisible union of the Bride of Christ, there’ll be a marriage take place. It could take place
       tonight, for all we know.
        I’m sorry I preached so long this morning, I left my little Timex watch at home. It kinda
       pressed me a little bit, because I got worried. I thought, I get the people so weary and so tired.
       Then I left my watch at home, then that worried me because I got thinking…The devil will tell
       you, “It’s two o'clock. It’s two o'clock” So, I got to just about believing it and it started putting
       pressure on me, you know and I could hardly even think. So, well it was pretty late, one o'clock.
       I would to God, that I could do better and try to just preach an hour. Well I don’t know, when
       your uneducated and you don’t have no homiletics, I guess you just have to suffer, you know.
       Homiletics: Definition- Reference:
       One who practices or studies in art of instruction in form of preaching and writing sermons.
       So, well I always wanted to get to that place, where I could preach like a shot gun! Automatic
       firing you know and say it all in twenty minutes. But seems like I’ve never got to that place yet
       or don’t know whether I ever will.
        Maybe the Apostle Paul tried to get to that place, when he preached all night long. One poor
       little brother, stood it as long as he could and finally fell out from the upper story, about three
       floors up and I guess it broke his neck, I don’t know. But God awarded him, with suffering with
       Paul! Paul went over and called his life back to him. So, could be we only have a one-story
       building, you don’t have far to fall, but somehow someday God will bless you richly for your
       patience in sitting and hearing his word.
        There’s one thing for sure, we’ve done heard enough to know, that Jesus Christ is revealing
       his word in this end-time. It’s not emotionalism or fanaticism or a cult or a isms, but Jesus Christ
       is revealing his word. He is revealing things that the prophets of many ages gone by, desired to
       look into and was not able to do it! And after praying and crying and fasting to God to reveal to
       them what was these great things that they we’re seeing into. And God told them it wasn’t for
       them, it was for a later day. That the book was now sealed up, but in the end-time the little bride
       of Christ, that this great book would be open unto them.

       Do you believe that—that God in this last days has is restoring back the Church again? Do you
       believe that? Isn’t He wonderful to do it? And aren’t we happy to be alive tonight to see it? Our
       eyes are beholding things that—that the prophets desired to see just before the second coming
       of our Lord.
        We believe the reason why, there’s Nine hundred or four hundred different denominations.
       Hundred and hundreds of different independent works, former rain latter rain brethren, all kinds
       of different groups has raised up. And we believe because, why there is so many is because the
       bible is not revealed to everybody. Though many people read this book and preach out of this
       book, this book is only wrote to one class of people and that’s the Bride of Christ! And I don’t
       care who you are, I don’t care how long you go to bible school, I don’t care if you go to Bob
       Jones university or the most greatest theological seminary that’s in the world today, you cannot
       learn one thing about God unless he reveals himself to you.
        In fact, no man can even call Jesus their Lord outside of the Holy Ghost. It takes the Holy
       Ghost to reveal Jesus to you! Because Jesus is the Word of God, and the only way that you can
       know Jesus is by a Revelation. You can’t see Jesus, the only way that you can know Jesus today
       is by a Revelation. And I think that’s how we’re to be saved and that is by a personal revelation
       to you, yourself a personal revelation of Jesus the word of God for this hour. And how happy we
       ought to be, that if the Holy Ghost has revealed to you the word of God and you have a
       revelation, then you ought to be the most happiest person on the face of the earth! Are you
       happy? (Amen)

       William Marrion Branham
       But on the books of Heaven it’s just the same. That’s right. The reason I take my shoulders with
       you brethren, there’s a shout of the King in the camp. There’s signs and wonders following these
       people. They make their mistakes, and they get a lot of isms, and a lot of nonsense. You know
       that brethren, you… We might as well face it. That’s right. We got a lot of things that goes on of
       impersonations and so forth, that isn’t right, but there’s a real thing there too. That’s right. 21
       When Jesus came, He was just as fundamental as the Pharisees. The Pharisees couldn’t believe
       it. But Jesus was fundamental. But there was signs and wonders following His ministry. Where
       the Pharisees had the Word just the same as He had, the same Word. But it’s a spiritual
       revelation. Jesus witnessed to it when He come off the mountain, and He said, “Who does men
       say I, the Son of man am?” One said Elisha, and one said it was a prophet, and so forth. He
       said, “But who do you say?” And Peter said, “Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.”
       Now, the Catholic church says that Peter was the rock, and upon this rock the church is built.
       The Protestant church says it was upon Jesus, the Rock. Not to be different, let them believe what
       they wish to, as long as it’s on Christ, but I—I different from both views. I believe that it was not
       upon Peter that the Church was built, neither was it upon Christ the Church was built, but it was
       upon the spiritual revelation that He was the Christ. See, see? 22 “Flesh and blood has not
       
       3
       revealed this to you (some seminary, some school, some theology, some intellectual)… “Flesh
       and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in heaven; upon this Rock I’ll
       build My Church,” the spiritual revelation, not by Word, not by denomination, not by creed,
       not by so forth, but upon spiritual revelation that Jesus is the Christ, “I’ll build My Church.”
       Now, you might believe that in your mind, when you believe that in the heart you got Eternal
       Life. Jesus said in Saint John 5:24: “He that heareth My Word and believeth on Him that sent
       Me, has Eternal Life.” Take that word Eternal and see what it means. Run it back in the
       Greek; you will find it Zoe, God’s own Life. You got Immortal Life in you, because why? You
       have believed on Him being the only begotten Son of God and accepted Him as your personal
       Saviour. Not by intellectual, but by a birth, how God has brought it down and revealed it to
       you by spiritual revelation. 23 Faith cometh by hearing. Faith is hearing, when you hear it.
       But faith isn’t the thing. For instance, I’m here; I’m starving to death, and I ask you for—for a
       loaf of bread, and you give me twenty-five cents. That’s the purchase power of a loaf of bread.
       Now, I can rejoice just as much with the twenty-five cents as I could with a loaf of bread. But yet,
       it’s not the loaf of bread. It’s not the loaf of bread. But I can be happy with it. I’ll keep the
       twenty-five cents, knowing, “Thank you, sir, my life shall now be saved.” But I haven’t got the
       bread. You get what I mean? See? By faith you are saved, but it’s a revelation of Christ that
       brings the results. You get what I mean? See? That’s what I’m speaking of.

       much God wants you to know. If you can’t see this Revelation, don’t ask the bishop. Ask God.
       Don’t ask your pastor. Ask God. “The Son reveals Him,” He, personal pronoun.
        We certainly believe that there’s…We have a wonderful brother here this morning, I talked to
       him outside, believing there’s gonna be a great revival break out.
        I do to, but I’m afraid that though many may feel that spirit in the atmosphere goin be poured
       out…I’m afraid it’s gonna be a great shock when the revival comes. It’s not coming the way they
       think, it’ll be altogether different then the way they got figured out. It will be a great revival, but
       it’ll be different. Because man, always in his mind has got it figured out, what God is gonna do
       and how God’s gonna do it. And then when he does it, it’s always different then the way they got
       it figured out.
        And if you’ll look in the Bible, this is why people religious people have always missed the
       true divine move of God, because it came different then the way they had it figured out.

       306 It’s on the backside, when a Book is completed. Not did he say, “On the front side.” He said,
       “On the backside,” after It’s all done, completed. Then, these Seven Thunders’ voices is the only
       thing, that’s stuck to the Book, that’s not revealed. It’s not even written in the Book. 307 Oh, my!
       I wish I could get that, that the people could actually…Don’t fail. Don’t, don’t fail. Please
       
       4
       don’t, this time. I’m fixing to leave you. Don’t fail. You ever listened, listen! 308 These Seals
       are on the backside of the Book. “And at the time that the seventh angel is sounding, all the
       mysteries that are written in the Book is completed.” And immediately the Book, that was open
       and written within, is closed, “The mysteries of God is finished.” And this is the mysteries of
       God: the going of the Church, and all these other things. “The mysteries is over.” When that
       seventh angel sounds out every mystery, it’s over. Let him be who he may, whatever it might be.
       God’s Word can’t fail. And He said: But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he
       shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants
       the prophets. 309 All those things, like, oh, Rome being the—the whore, and all the Protestant
       churches, denominations denominating after her, has become her harlots. See? All those
       mysteries, that the prophets spoke of, will be revealed right here in this last hour. 310 And
       when this seventh angel rises in the Laodicean age and begins to sound forth the true Trumpet,
       because It’ll be contrary, they won’t believe It. They sure won’t believe It. But, it’ll be an
       inspired prophet, because there’s no way to figure It out. 311 Men try to figure out the trinity,
       and go gray-headed and go crazy. No one can understand it. They still believe Eve eat an apple,
       and all those things. Because, it’s tradition that men has held onto, just like Jesus found the
       church. 312 But it’ll have to be a Divine-led prophet, for the Word of God to come to him, with
       the true interpretation of the revelation of Jesus Christ. So, then, it—it’s got to be that way.
       God help us! 313 Now, “When he is sounding forth,” now, that’s THUS SAITH THE LORD.
       We have that clear. When he sounds forth his Message, declares war; like Paul did on the
       Orthodox, like the rest of them did, like Luther, Wesley, against the organization. When he
       declares war, and tells them, “They are lying, and it’s not the Truth! And they’re deceiving
       men!” When he sounds forth That, you can’t fail. It won’t fail, because he’ll be vindicated by
       the Word of God. You’ll know exactly what It is. And when he does, he sounds forth, to call
       from Babylon, “Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins.” God, send
       him! Don’t miss it. 314 Now, “When he begins to sound, the mystery will be finished.” Now,
       note, then it’s time for the Seven Seal voices, of Revelation 10, to be revealed. Do you
       understand? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] When all the mysteries of the Book has
       completed! And the Bible said, here, that he would finish the mysteries.

       10 But, look, just let me just say this now. I suppose this is just tapes for ourselves, and so forth.
       But let me say it, see. That, you—you don’t…You don’t get it, see, and you’re not supposed to
       get it. So don’t try to interpret anything, see. Don’t try to put your interpretation to it; you
       only—you only get further away. Just take my advice, if you believe me now, if God has—has
       give me favor in your sight. 11 And you know, that, them revelations and things. I—I been here
       with you a long time, see, and it’s always been right. And now to double prove it, right, it hooks
       right in with the Word. See? So, you know It’s THUS SAITH THE LORD. That’s exact. See, It’s

       anything. You just go on and live a good Christian life. Cause, you’ll only wind yourself away
       from the real thing when you do it. See? You, you’ll only wind your way again away from the

       that lets me know what it is. It’s something that’s tremendous. And it’s gone right now, and
       there’s not a way in the world for you to see it. And it’s…I…But, so help me, with this Bible in
       my hand, I know what it is. It’s been told you, before. So just—just don’t try to put any
       interpretation, but just believe me, as your brother. See? We’re living in a great hour. We’re
       living in a time where the…Well, we’re… 14 Now, you just be real humble, be a Christian, and
       try to live for God. And live honest with your fellow man, and love those who don’t love you.
       Don’t try to make any…You see, you do, you only make it a mysterious something, and mess the
       real program of God up. See? 15 Yesterday afternoon, something happened in my room, that
       I’ll—I’ll never be able to—to leave it, you see. And so you… And about two weeks ago,
       something happened, it’ll never be able…As long as I live on this earth, I—I’ll never be able to
       get away from it, see. And, so, but… 16 And the—the church, you’re not supposed to know
       these things, so don’t put no interpretation to anything. See? You just go ahead and just
       remember what you’re told. Live a Christian life. Go to your church. Be a real light wherever
       you are, and just burn for Christ, and tell the people that how you love Him. And just let your
       testimony be with love, all the time, with the people. See? Cause, if you don’t, you twist yourself
       out into something there, and then you’re—you’re off the beaten track. See, every time you’ve
       tried to do it, you’ve done that. See? So just don’t, don’t, don’t try to make no interpretation. 17
       And especially, tonight, when that Seal becomes up in front of you, see, just don’t try to interpret
       It. You just go ahead and just be humble, and go right on with the same plain Message.
        So therefore, we know it’s only gonna be for the elected Bride! It’s gonna be to the souls in
       prison, but it’s gonna be for the church and the Bride. So, God hasten the day when this glorious
       event will take place.
        I was talking on the telephone this afternoon, to Brother Mike Canada. And he promised to be
       with us, not this week but the next week. I know you’ll be looking forward to that. I was hoping
       he would come because… I just think I’d like to have brother Mike to come because I was
       looking at the date and December the 12th to the twentieth is a religious feast in Jerusalem,
       among the Jews. And that feast is their latter rain feast. Their latter rain when they have they’re
       feast of harvest. I forget the name of the Jewish name (feast days), I can’t think of it. It falls
       between the 18th and the 20th. And so therefore, I thought…I never look to dates, don’t have no
       confidence in dates at all. Unless the Holy Ghost would give me one, then I’d have confidence in
       it. Well, I’d just like that and I thought that, it would be good. It would certainly be wonderful to
       have Brother Mike Canada to come at that time. And perventure, he’d be here not this week but
       the next week. So, I thought you might be encouraged about that.
        And then it looks to me like, that I’m gonna have to go down in Jeffersonville Ind. to preach
       for Brother Don Ruddell. Because the pressures building up and I can’t put it off no longer!
       Because I feel bad about that, Brother Donald comes up here and labors hard in this congregation
       and preaches his heart out and then he keeps after me to come and then I don’t come. Because I
       want the word of the Lord, before I ever go anywhere. So, it looks to me like I’m just gonna have
       to go anyway and pray that God will have mercy upon me, and help me.
        I’m just about one service preacher, these days. I preach about one service and that’s about all
       I can do. I feel the spirit is very poor these days. We feel so poor in spirit and we feel and see the
       lack, when we see the need of the hour. But I found out, unless God moves you can’t make him
       move. I would rather wait on God…I would rather wait on God and be still and wait upon him
       for his time and his season. And then when that comes, then you put in the sickle and begin to
       reap.

        But to try to present this great revelation out before the public, it’s just not in me to do it.
       However, it just falls my lot, there’s some things I got to do whether I have the revelation from
       God or not! And that is, I’ve got to go down there and preach for the brother. I was gettin along
       pretty good gettin out of it, till this time it came up and he said something about it at the supper
       table. And Shirley said, “I think we’re coming up next July!” And I tell you, his face got red as a
       beet! And he was just flabbergasted! And I seen right then, Lord shame on me, I’m gonna have
       to go down there. I said, “She’s just kidding you, Brother Ruddell I’m gonna come down!” He
       said, “You better believe it, your coming down! Or it’s the last time I’m preaching for you boy!”
       So, I hope you’ll be praying for me. I’m not saying I’m goin yet, but making plans that way. And
       then sister Ruddell wanted me to bring Shirley if I could, because she don’t get any fellowship.
       So, if we can work it out I’ll take my wife with me and maybe I can slip in there and he won’t
       tell nobody about it. I can just slip in there and nobody won’t know about it but his church. Then
       time it gets out, I can be gone. Course if you’re not familiar, you don’t know what I’m talkin
       about.
        There’s two words you can’t mention today in some parts of the country, and that’s “Token
       and Lambert!” Because if you do, it brings some… (Brother Lambert chuckles) hard times. So,
       well I want you to be prayin about that.
        I want to announce to the church here, that your tithes here we’re trying to help Brother
       Canada. We believe him to be a man of God. Most of his congregation walked off and left him,
       when he begin to preach more of the word of God. You know how steady Brother Mike Canada
       is, his life is clean before the Lord. And we have confidence in him, as a man of God. And we
       love him dearly, and we want to send him another offering this week. We’ve been sending him
       money right along and I’d just like you to know, that’s who we’re supporting. We support
       Brother Ruddell financially and Brother Canada and then we also support three little brothers in
       Trinidad W. Indies that preaches faithfully for the Lord.
        There’s many preachers in the land, but when you find one that lives the life that isn’t a
       money lover, and that lives the life and doesn’t live hypocrisy and just stays with the word of
       God, they’re few and far in between! I want you to know we’re still supporting Shaffie
       Mohamed in Guinea West Africa. It’s been three or four years now, they’ve stayed faithfully
       with the word of God, sunshine or rain. They’re very poor down there, we just recently sent
       those fella’s a hundred dollars apiece, there’s about four of them. And then I want you to know
       where your tithes go. Your tithes are not wasted, we keep those tithes and we don’t put them in
       the bank, but a brother here in the church keeps them. And we want to help Gods servants. So,
       may the Lord lead us and guide us, where to put our money.
        I’m sorry to say that sometimes that we’ve supported things that later…Well, I don’t know it
       gets kinda discouraging, sometimes. So, we’re just gonna pray, that God we’ll help us and lead
       us and guide us. But I want to support ministers that I know, that their life is irreproachable.
        We’re certainly living in an hour when the devil is attacking the preachers. I believe it’s true
       what was said by Brother Branham, always made this statement. There’s three Great things that
       the devil will snare a preacher with, “That’s popularity, money and women.”

       51-0729E - The Second Miracle
       William Marrion Branham
       There’s three things that I’ve watched in my life, in the reading of other ministers, when God
       blesses a minister just a little bit on the… Now, we’re all friends, aren’t we? When He blesses
       him just a little bit above maybe someone else, or—or give him an opportunity to do a little more
       work for Him or something, the first thing that Satan goes to working with that minister is
       three things, major things. The first thing is money, women, popularity. He will work on him
       with money, or if he can get him to… Like his first bait, that’s like in the garden of Eden. Well, or
       if he can get him to thinking he’s something when he ain’t nothing, he’s got him right then.
       
        My prayer is constantly before the Lord, lead me and guide me out of all of temptation. And I
       promised the Lord God if he would bless my ministry, I would never take up an offering, I would
       never take money from nobody. And many times, people give me money, when I’m out and I
       won’t even receive it. I tell them, put it in the offering plate or give it to somebody else. And if
       God will bless me in a way that I’m going, I’ll never receive any money from people. If they
       want to put it in the ministry, put it in the offering…And if God would ever blesses my ministry
       in the supernatural, I made that promise to him. I have a terrible dislike for the ministry begging
       for money. I never did like it, and I’ve never done it and by the grace of God…I believe if God
       send you, he’ll take care of you. And personally, to tell you the truth, I wouldn’t even take up
       tithes as an offering, I mean as an offering plate being passed from aisle to aisle. I wouldn’t of
       even done that. The Lord Knows that I never did that. Until I heard the angel of the Lord told
       Brother Branham said, “Take up the offering, that my way to bless Gods people!” So, Brother
       Branham said, “It had to be done.” So therefore, we just take up tithes and offerings. If you want
       to pay your tithes, that’s up to you.
        In this group, here… This is the only group that I know of, that I have ever seen that’s
       established complete upon the word of God. Not premediating anything, but just done that way.
        I have some good dear brethren and I love them very dearly, tried to talk me into ministerial
       papers. And God knows they did do that, and that’s the only time I ever did anything like that
       and I got rid of them. I don’t believe in ministerial papers, I believe it’s the mark of the beast. I
       believe God calls you, he’ll equip you. And if ever give me a ministry, he’ll make room for it.
        I never advertised these people to come here. I opened up this little store front building, with
       just a hand full of people. Most of them that I had, walked off and left me. I said, “If God called
       me to Connecticut, he’ll send his people here. I don’t worry about that! And he did it! He did it!
       And then he said that, “He would send me around the world” That ain’t my responsibility! He
       said, “He would give me a deliverance ministry” That ain’t my responsibility! He said, “The
       world is gonna have to hear this Revelation!” That’s not my responsibility! All I did, is just tell
       you what he told me! Now, if he don’t do what he told me, why then I lied. Then if he does do it,
       then you listen to what I tell you. He’ll do just exactly what he told me. So therefore, I have
       faith! I have faith!

       63-0901E - Desperations
       William Marrion Branham
       67 I believe that the reason we don’t have desperation is because it’s a lack of love, God, the
       love of God. I think that the love of God causes desperation. If God is in you, the Token inside
       of you, and you see the conditions of times, and people wading in sin the way they are, it’ll
       throw you into desperation. I believe it will. 68 Now the Word plainly states, if you want to put
       this down, in Galatians 5:6, that, “Faith worketh by love.” See? “Faith worketh by love.” And
       the only way that you can have faith, is have love first. Because, after all, faith is love’s
       incentive. Incentive, that’s exactly what—what faith is. It’s an incentive to love. Now, you, if you
       don’t have love, you can’t have faith. See?
        You see, any preacher can run out ahead of God, that’s easy, that’s easy. The devil has tried to
       get me to run ahead of God, for thirteen years. But I have waited! I have waited because, God
       called me. So therefore, I don’t have to worry. I’ve had the devil use people and threaten me that
       I was gonna lose my ministry, if I didn’t do this and do that. But I stayed right there. See no,
       God’s not a, Indian Giver! If he ever told you anything and give you anything brother, it’ll ring
       through eternity!
        And so therefore, we want to wait on God. And you know that I’m made up in that way. I
       love God’s people and want to help God’s people, but I want to wait upon the Lord. So therefore,
       I promised the Lord, I’d never go anywhere and hold any meetings, unless he sent me. And I
       have been faithful to that, even back when the Lord offered me a tent. I was around deliverance
       evangelists praying for the sick. You know how I told you, when the Lord Jesus appeared to me
       and give me to pray for the sick. I’ve never got into that ministry, to this day. I’ve cried my eyes,
       till they’re swollen together, I’ve agonized, I’ve done everything but it’s just not anointed. I can’t
       help that! And but I know, that one day it will. Why it doesn’t won’t work, I don’t know. The
       gift is laying there and it don’t operate. I can’t make them operate. I’ve cried myself sick,
       worried myself sick over it, and the Lord God came to me and told me that, “Those gifts operate
       by Love!” I was trying to ask him, “Why they didn’t operate?” And he came to me and said,
       “They operate by love” And so therefore, he told me, “Do what I told you to do, be still and be
       quiet! The Holy Ghost is coming to teach you the word!” Now see, in those days I was more
       concerned about the anointing to operate the gifts. I seen them operated, the gifts that God give
       me, but then they stopped. I’m glad they did, because my head might of got as big as a bushel
       basket. I might of went out and brought shame upon the name of the Lord. I didn’t have wisdom,
       I didn’t have the training that I needed. And so therefore, God’s loving merciful hand, let me
       wait upon him so he could train me with the word. So therefore, he kept that part, that he told me
       and I kept my part. It took me many black eyes and many heartaches and much hardship, until I
       did what he told me to do. He said, “Go home and be still and be quiet, and the Holy Ghost will
       come and teach you!” And when I did that, immediately the supernatural presence of God started
       coming to me when I was alone. And then he would teach me his word. Anything that I got, I got
       it from the Holy Ghost in his word. So therefore, I believe with all of my heart, there’s gonna be
       a ministry break out across United States. And that people are thinking that is not coming and it
       will be a Word Ministry, A Word ministry! It’s gonna be a, Word Revival!
        So, I think each one of us be faithful, to wait upon the Lord God. And when the hour arises,
       why then, he’ll do the thing that he promised.
       
       9
        So, I hope you’ll be remembering me in prayer, to go down there and you know…You can
       never tell, the enemy may be alerted. Maybe someone know that you’re coming that…You don’t
       know what it is, when the enemy come and sit down where your ministering and resent what
       you’re saying. And it makes it real hard.
        So, what a glorious day when the power of the Holy Ghost comes among his people and all
       these great wonderful things that he’s promised will come to pass. And there’ll be a great revival
       of the just, break out. We’ll begin to do much damage, to the Devil!
        Now, I’m just gonna read something to you. I’m happy to have our friends back with us
       tonight again. And we pray that God will bless them.
        Now, Romans 8:28. Have you been enjoying the word, Sunday morning, Sunday night?
       (Amen) How many, let’s see your hands that it helped you to understand? If I could… Now next
       Sunday, I’ll probably be down to Brother Ruddell’s. But I’d like to finish that up.
        How many like to hear what I think about Judas? How many have been confused about
       Judas? You haven’t understood him, where the messenger prophet said, that he was “justified
       and sanctified.” How many you’d like to hear it? I said this morning that I could prove, that
       Judas was never Justified. Judas was never Sanctified and Judas was never called. And I’d like to
       take one service and preach on nothing but Judas. And to show you the word of God…No matter
       what happens…No matter what happens, stay with the word!
        That’s why I believe, every child of God ought to read his Bible and see. In other-words if a
       minister says something, find out why he said it.
        It’s like Brother Branham said…The Angel of the Lord told Brother Branham, “One morning
       while he was shaving, “Don’t say that, don’t say that! Say this here, say it this way!” Brother
       Branham said the angel of the Lord told me, “You got to many hanging onto your ministry, thin
       them down” He said, “I have to say things this way, to cause some to leave” I say it this way to
       cause others to ponder over it, search it out and see whether or not its so.”

       64-0319 - Calling Jesus On The Scene
       William Marrion Branham
       81 We need a Book of Acts again. But the only way you’ll do it is get back to the Bible, and away
       from some of this hybrid religion. 82 Hybreeding, have to be babied! No faith! Just a bunch of—
       of powder puffs, just sissified, babied into it. “I’m…” I say, are you a Christian? “I’m
       Methodist.” Are you a Christian? “I’m Presbyterian. I’m Pentecostal.” That don’t mean that, to
       God. [Brother Branham snaps his finger—Ed.] 83 You’re a Christian because you are born in
       the Spirit of Christ, and the Word of God lives in you. 84 You know, I always enjoy a high-bred
       horse. You know, he has got sense. You can—you can teach him things, do things for him, and
       he’ll learn. But you take an old mule, you can’t do nothing to him. He’s just a big old long-eared
       donkey. He sits there, and, you could talk to him, he’ll stick his ears out, and, “Huh? Huh?
       Huh?” See, that, he’s just a hybrid. 85 Puts in mind, a lot of these so-called Christians, hybrid,
       donkey religion. You tell them Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever; say, “I
       don’t believe It.” See? And so you can’t never teach him nothing. How can you teach him;
       he’s gone, anyhow. “My church believes It this way. Mine believes It that way.” But God’s
       Word says He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever! I like not a hybrid Christian. 86 I like
       a—like a pedigreed horse. He knows who his papa was, who his mama was, who his grandpa
       and grandma was. He knows all the generations all the way back. 87 So does a pedigreed
       
       10
       Christian, he knows Who his Father is. He come from God; He is the Word of God, He’s the
       same as He ever was. He’s a real pedigreed product of God, the Word of God is in him, Jesus
       Christ manifesting Himself. 88 Bunch of unbelievers! Jesus wanted to shake off a bunch of
       parasites one day, He had too many following Him. He had His disciples. Then, He had the
       seventy, the ministerial association. Then, He had the congregation, by the thousands. And then
       He made this statement, He said, “Except you eat the Blood…eat the flesh of the Son of man,
       and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.”
       
        So, there’s many things that’s on tape and in books that causes people to be confused. But the
       little Bride, see will go through all that hunger and thirst and she’ll come out with the truth.
        One tape will say, “Come in”, another tape will say, “Stay in” and this and that. He said, “The
       foolish virgins are holy they’re Sanctified, they’re virgins.” Another tape he turned around and
       said, “They’re dirty and unclean, they’re not justified, they’re not sanctified.” One tape he said,
       “Your baptized with the Holy Ghost the new birth.” Then another tape he’ll say, “No your born
       again then your filled with the Holy Ghost” And on and on it goes you see, you can throw your
       mind in a turmoil.
        I’ll say this and I’ve said it before, I went several years preaching…I’ve preached several
       years after Jesus appeared to me in 1958.
        Of course, that’s common, you know. Jesus appears to so many people. I come out and I
       thought I had an unusual experience, where I met Jesus, and talked with him. I come out and
       every preacher that came out in town in a tent, saw an angel and talked to Jesus. I found out my
       experience was just as common as “Gab’s Turkey”. That’s right!
        But then you know, there was something striking…Something striking about it though you,
       the things that Jesus told them, he never did tell me that. Whatever he told me, he took me to the
       word of God and showed it in the word. And you know what I got to believing? A lot of people
       never met the Jesus, that I met! The Jesus that I met, was a God of his word! And I say, if you
       ever met Jesus, you’ll meet him in his word! So, I’ve seen all kinds of people that heard audible
       voices and people that look me right in the eyes and say, “I heard an audible voice.” What are
       you gonna say, I don’t know! Well, you heard an audible voice! And then you turn right around
       and say something contrary, to what the word of God says. How could it be? see!
        I’ve had women look me right in the eyes…One night I was preaching, in a place down in
       Florida. Somewhere over in the middle of central Florida. And there was two women in there,
       that was really lookin at me hard, you know. And I thought, my, I just felt something awful
       funny, you know. I went right on preaching. I preached against women preachers, as hard as I
       could preach against them. That’s right, I don’t believe in it. I don’t believe God…The Bible
       said, “God ascended on high and gave gifts unto men!” There is no scripture in the Bible, where
       God ever called a woman to preach. Well, you say, “There was Debra” That was in the old
       Testament and she was a judge, see. God never called a woman to minister as a preacher. And
       after I got through preaching, naturally they stood out there waitin on me, you know. I come by
       and said, “How do you do, sisters!” One of them said, “I wouldn’t of thought, you would of
       called me a sister, after the way you preached!” I knew, I said, “Well, how’s that sister dear?”
       We she said, “Well, I’m a lady evangelist!” Oh, I said, “You are? You’re a lady evangelist?” She
       said, “Yes, and she’s a lady evangelist to. And we’re evangelizing here in the south.” They told
       me where they was working. I said, “That’s real nice, but God never did call you to do it!’ She
       said, “I’ll have you to know, I’m a evangelist!” I said, “Evangeless! There’s no scripture in the
       Bible where there are Evangeless! Prophetess, but know Evangeless!” It took a little while to get
       
       11
       that point over. But she said, well we’re not evangelists but we’re just preachers.” I said, “The
       Bible said, he ascended up on high and gifts unto men, apostle’s prophets, evangelists, pastors
       and teachers. And not a one of them is a woman!”
       Ephesians 4:8
       8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto
       men.
       I said, “Show me your office in the Bible? Give me a scripture?” She said, “Well I tell you one
       thing, the Lord Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene and said, go tell my disciples.” So, that made
       Mary an evangelist, go tell my disciples. (Brother Lambert laughs) Well, then she said, “I heard
       an audible voice!” I said, “You did?” She said, “One morning around a little bit towards daylight
       and my husband and I we’re lying in the bed. And I heard an audible voice spoke right out in the
       bedroom and said, “Go preach my gospel” And she said, “Now, your gonna tell me that wasn’t
       God, Brother Lambert?” Oh I said, “Well, whether or not you heard an audible voice.” She said,
       “But I’ve left my husband and my children!” I said, “Ugh uh! Now it comes out!” I said, “You
       left your husband and your children” I said, “That’s what God called you to do, now I’ll give you
       a scripture for that!” I said, “Let the women love their husbands, be good keepers at home and
       raising their children. I would advise you to go back to your husband and take care of your
       children because God never did call you, to preach the gospel!” I tell you, I wasn’t too popular at
       that spot right there where I was standing.
       Titus 2:4,5-Reference quote:
       4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their
       children,
       5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of
       God be not blasphemed.
       1 Timothy 2:12-Reference quote:
       12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
        I’m so thankful, that there is a people that will stay with Gods word and say what God said.
       So well, we know the church world don’t like that, you know. They say now everybody have a
       good time and shout and live any way that you want to and the Lord, it’ll be alright with him.
       Oh, dearly beloved stay with Gods word, because “Heavens and earth shall pass away and Gods
       word will never pass away.”
       Matthew 24:25
       35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
        Now let’s read from Romans 8:28 a minute. Before I read, there’s something that I didn’t get
       to read this morning. Romans 8:28. I hope you brought your Bibles. Read your Bibles friend!
       Oh, if there was ever an hour to read the good book and get it into your heart. Love the word!
       Oh, we need to love the word more, you see! Realizing, that everything is gonna pass away but
       the word.
       
       12
       Romans 8:28-Reading
       28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the
       called according to his purpose.
       29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,
       that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
        Now watch here, all things no matter what it is. All things, that happen to this elected group,
       that we’ve been preaching about last Sunday and this morning. All things, no matter what it is,
       whatever trial comes your way. All circumstances involved, whatever happens to you in your
       pilgrimage journey here when your called, under this foreordained predestinated group of people
       under this Bride covenant. All things will work together for those that Love God, that are called
       according to his purpose.
        Not as I said this morning, that we are not saved because we willed to be saved. We’re not
       saved because we felt real religious and we wanted to be saved. That’s not why we’re saved or
       how we’re saved, because we desired to be saved. Because everything about our nature is
       contrary to God. You never did like to hear preachers, you never did like the songs of Zion, you
       didn’t want nothing to do with God. Everything about you was contrary, you ran from God.
       Romans 8:7-Reference quote:
       7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
       indeed can be.
        As we said many times, it wasn’t Adam saying, “Oh God, where are you? Oh, God I got to
       find you Lord, I’m naked I got to find you.” It wasn’t, it was God that came down himself! God
       came down himself in the cool of the evening and said, “Adam, where are you?” And, where was
       he? Hid over in the bush! See! See, everything about us is contrary to God!
        And as I said before, we are not saved on any certain day. Just because that you heard the
       preacher and excepted the word of God, was Baptized in his name that doesn’t save you. If you
       we’re ever to ever be saved, you we’re always saved.
        And if the Bible said over in John 1…Oh, if this can ever get into your heart! The Bible said
       in John 1:1 said, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
       was God and the word was made flesh.”
       John 1:1-Reference quotes:
       In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
       John 1:14
       14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
       the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
        Now the Bible said, In Revelations…Now I’m adding two scriptures that I haven’t used
       before on this subject.
        But notice here, in Revelations 13:8 it said, “And all that dwell upon the face of the earth
       shall be deceived by the beast, except those that had their name written in the Lambs book of
       life, slain from the foundation of the world.
       
       13
       Revelations 13:8-Reference quote:
       8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book
       of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
        So, when did you get your name put in the Lambs book of life? Not when you excepted Christ
       as your personal savior! If your name was ever in the Lambs book of Life, it was wrote there by
       Christ, before the foundation of the world.
        Now if Christ Jesus said to the scribes and Pharisees said, “No man takes my life away from
       me! You’re not gonna take my life away from me, I’ll lay it down. I lay it down of my own free
       will!”
       John 10:18-Reference quote:
       18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I
       have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
        He didn’t have to do it! He could of escaped, they couldn’t have done nothing with the Lord.
       One time they we’re gonna shove him over a Clift and kill him and the Bible said, “That he
       passed right through them and they couldn’t find him” Where did he go to?
       Luke 4:30-Reference quote;
       28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
       29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon
       their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
       30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,
        He could of come down off of the cross. Like the ole thief said, “Come down off of the
       cross!” No sir! He could of come down off of the cross! He said, “Think not, that I could for
       many legions of angels and get them from my father.”
       Matthew 26:53-Reference quote:
       53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more
       than twelve legions of angels?
        No sir! He willed, to lay his life down! He willed, to lay it down! He said, “I’ll lay it down”
       And then he said, I’ll raise it back up again!” See, “Destroy my body… Destroy this temple my
       body, in three days I’ll raise it up.” He said, “I’ll raise it up!”
       John 1:19-Reference quote:
       19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
        Well, Paul said, “The Holy Ghost raised it up” So then, the Holy Ghost in Jesus must be one
       and the same. Jesus said, “Destroy this temple and in three days I’ll raise it up.” And then Paul
       turned around and said, “The Holy Ghost raised him from the dead.” Then the father the Son and
       the Holy Ghost is, one person then.
       
       14
       Romans 8:11-Reference quote:
       11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
       Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
        I believe in a trinity of, Father Son and Holy Ghost in three offices. I don’t believe there is
       three persons in the God-Head. If they are, we got three Gods. But I believe the person of Jesus
       Christ is almighty God. See! In the, father-hood, In the Son-ship, in the Holy Ghost. See!
        Now Jesus said, I come from God…Now remember, I come from God and I go back to God!
       Showing you there that he come from God. He come from God!
       John 16:28-Reference quote:
       28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to
       the Father.
       
       And the Bible said in John 1 and 1. “In the beginning was the word!” How many, is that? One!
       “And the word was God!” Was the word God? Then God was the word then, wasn’t he? The
       word was God and God was the word. And the 14th verse of 1 John. “And the word was made
       flesh and dwelt among us.” And that was the Lord Jesus Christ. So, then the Lord Jesus Christ
       was God almighty. He was deity made flesh. God became human, became one of us! See!
        Now, if we we’re ever to be saved, we had to be in the same place as Jesus Christ was. See!
       Now as I often say this, witnessing to people out in the world and to get it over to them I say,
       “Did you ask of one person in this assembly tonight, did you ask to come into your father’s
       family?” Did you have one thing to do with being born into your father’s family? Well, where
       was you before you were born into your father’s family? Where was you? You had to be
       somewhere! As, we often say, “I don’t have any hair up here!” Tell me where it come
       from…Where did that hair come from and I’ll tell you where it is now!
        Because Jesus said, “That he numbered EVERY HAIR OF YOUR HEAD!” He knew where
       they we’re at! Oh, don’t tell me he’s ain’t great! He ain’t, no little God!
       Luke 12:7- Reference quote:
       7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more
       value than many sparrows.
        “In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was made flesh and
       dwelt among us.”
        Now, just as you had nothing to do with coming into our father’s family, neither have you got
       anything to do with coming into Gods spiritual family!
        You’re not saved by your will, your father’s will, the preachers will, or the churches will. But
       you are saved by, THE WILL OF GOD!
       James 1:18 and we’ll use that scripture again tonight. It said, “We have been begotten by the will
       of God.” God’s will! It was God’s will, to save you.
       James 1:18
       18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his
       creatures.
       
       15
        It was the goodness of God, that leadeth thee to repentance. And then for by grace are ye
       saved, through faith not of works least any man should boast.” The goodness of God, lead you to
       repent. And then after you repented, the goodness of God gave you a Revelation. Did he not?
       Romans 2:4-Reference quote:
       4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing
       that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
       Ephesians 2:8-Reference quote:
       8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
       9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
        Salvation is a gift of God. It’s an unmerited favor with the Lord. It is a free gift! Not coming
       and buying salvation for such in such a price. But come and drink, of the Water of life Freely. It
       is a gift of God.
       
       Revelation 22:17-Referencr quote:
       17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that
       is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
        So therefore, you don’t receive the gift God, then him taking it away from you. Can you
       imagine people saying, “Well, I was saved back there and I backslid and went out in the world?”
       See, that’s what I’m trying to knock out of my brother. You went over and joined this Methodist
       Church and then went over and joined another branch of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, then
       got in the Pilgrim Holiness and finally he went back out in the world and then you couldn’t get
       that out of him. “I know, Junior I was lost and then I was saved and now I’m lost again!” I said,
       “There is no such thing in the Bible, like that!”
        Why, can you imagine me saying, “Well my mother…I was born of my mother and I’m
       gonna be born again?” No sir! Your only saved, one time! And that is a gift of God! And when
       he gives you a gift, he don’t take it back! He don’t lose it, as we said this morning. No, we we’re
       all love gifts to Christ! And Christ is not gonna lose a one of them. He said, “All that the father
       giveth me, shall come to me and him that cometh to me, I will no wise cast out.”
       John 6:39-Reference quote:
       39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should
       lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
       John 6:37-Reference quote:
       All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise
       cast out.
        So, what is it? All things work together for good to those that are called, who had their names
       written on the lamb’s book of life, slain from the foundation of the world. All things will work
       together for good, to those that are called according to that purpose.
       
       16
        Notice the purpose of God, the purpose and the plan of God has got the same sure. Because
       there is no power great enough to change the plan of God. Do you know any power in the world,
       that is great enough, to change the plan and purpose of God?
        So, then all things… I don’t care what kind of trial comes your way next week, how terrible it
       is. And you think, “Oh God I’m just bound to…Oh Lord!” See! Remember all things. You may
       not understand it right away! But all things will work together for good to them that love God.
       Romans 8:28-Reference quote:
       28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the
       called according to his purpose.
        Now many people, may quote that scripture. Many people may quote that scripture and in
       reality, it will not work for them. See, you have got to come under the purpose and plan of God
       for that to work. See! All though, there’ll be many millions quote that scripture, but have no right
       to quote it.
        See, the Bible is only wrote to one class of people, and that is to the Unconditional Covenant
       Bride, Elected Bride. That’s the first resurrection.
        And that’s what people don’t understand! There’ll be a multitude of people saved, that don’t
       come under what I’m preaching about. See, that is the cream of the crop, that the elite, that’s the
       Wise Virgin, who see no death at all, but passes from death unto life. That’s the first
       resurrection, that’s the high calling, that Paul preached about, see. But there’ll be many… And I
       know this stubbles people. There’ll be many heathen that never heard the gospel, will be saved,
       see. And there’ll be people that has never even excepted Christ, but was good to his children,
       will receive eternal life at the end of the thousand years.
        Now, don’t you say, “Well I’m gonna make sure, I believe this brother is gonna make it and I
       want to buy him this” No see, you can’t do that! See! I know what comes to people and they
       think. I don’t mean, I’m serious. Because the scripture…
        I tell you the biggest saddest thing, is on the white throne Judgment. Is when all the preachers
       walk up and all the church people walk up and find out their goin to hell. I know it! I think that’s
       sad, it hurts me! I’ve seen many fine preachers, see I’m afraid that many of them are gonna come
       up at the white throne judgement, thinking they’ll be alright because they preach and won souls.
       And their gonna find out, their gonna be lost.
        Because Jesus said, “Depart from me you worker of iniquity, I never did know you!” “Yes,
       but my name is so and so, Lord! I cast out devils, I healed the sick, I raised the dead. I had this
       great campaign and I won thousands of souls!” He says, “Depart from me, I never did know
       you!” That’s the preachers, the religious people.
       Matthew 7:22,23-Reference quote:
       22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
       name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
       23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
        And there was some other people that came before the Lord… Not the Bride, the Bride does
       not come before any judgement. She does not get judged for nothing, friend!

       272 Then look. You say, “Well, now, Brother Branham, do you mean to tell me there’s going to
       be…that—that people that’s going to be there at the White Throne Judgment?” They’ll… The
       Bride will never be judged. No, sir. She’s in Christ. How do you get in Christ? “By one Spirit
       we are all baptized into one Body.” Is, that right?
       
        And a lot of people think the Bride is gonna go through the tribulation! And after some people
       sit under my ministry as much as three years, left me and went out and said, “Brother Lambert
       believes the Bride, is gonna go through the tribulation!” I want one man, to ever put his finger on
       that where I ever preached anything like that? I never done it! I never did believe nothing like
       that.
        But there is a vast difference between the persecution and the tribulation. I believe God gives
       the tribulation in wrath, upon the people that are gonna persecute the Bride. But the end-time
       Bride of Christ is gonna go through a persecution, see. But no tribulation! There is gonna be a
       church world that goes through a tribulation period. But the Bride will not go through any of the
       time of Jacob’s trouble known as the great tribulation period, where all those great plagues are
       poured out.
        And the Catholic Church the man of sin, breaks their covenant and hunts down the people of
       God like dogs. Kills them and the blood will flow, boy it’ll be terrible.
        But the Bride will not be here, in that at all. The hundred and forty-four thousand Jews will
       get it. But not the Bride! No sir! Moses and Elijah will be there with the Hundred and forty-four
       thousand Jews. But the Bride will be in Heaven, waiting to come back down to earth for a
       thousand-year honeymoon.
        The Bride does not stand in the judgement at all, but she stands at the white throne
       Judgement, judging! She does the judging, she’s not judged, she’s judging. She stands there, yes
       sir!

       105 And then the great King and Queen comes down for the Judgment. The White Throne
       Judgment is set and the Books were opened. And there stands the redeemed, Holy Ghost born
       Church of the Living God, standing there in Her beauty to judge. “The Books were opened,
       judgment was set and every man was judged thus,” that was the sinner. “And another Book was
       opened,” not for the Holy Ghost Bride, she’ll never take it ’cause She’s in the Rapture.

       William Marrion Branham
       A while ago, when I was walking out to the wood just behind where I’m staying, and I thought,
       “Well, you know there’ll be many of those people I’ll never see again. I—I’ll never see you again
       
       18
       on earth.” And I think, “The next time I see them will be there in glory, or either… What if some
       of them don’t get saved, Lord, and the Bride, the church is to stand there as the judge. See?
       And the saints shall judge the earth.”
       
        And there’ll be people there, that have givin the bride of Christ a glass of water, a bed to sleep
       in. Not even knowing it, just something down in their heart moved upon them. And maybe you
       didn’t…
        Oh, we’re coming to it, that World Council of Churches are gonna take your house as sure as
       the world. That brother says, “Thank you Lord!” That’s real fanaticism, ain’t it? Thank the Lord
       for taking away his house. That World Council of Churches is gonna take your house, gonna take
       your car, gonna take everything that you got. Can you still say, thank you Lord? It ain’t helped
       you none, there’s another fanatic. My!
        Don’t you know that the Bible said, all those people like us, fanatic’s like us, the bible said in
       the 11th chapter of Hebrews said, “They dwelt in dens and in caves of the earth, wondering in the
       desert. Wondering in the desert and slept in dens and the caves and the world wasn’t worthy of
       them. And I believe there are gonna be some more wanders like that.
       Hebrews 11:38-Reference quote:
       38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens
       and caves of the earth.
        Oh Lord, move us out of Connecticut, anyway, it’s cold out here in the winter time.
       I’m a southerner boy! Every time I think as I’m sitting in the house and I look outside and think
       about this persecution coming. And I hear the wind blowing and poppin' them ole limbs and its
       so cold outside. I say, “Oh God, it would be terrible to be out there tonight, with no more spirit
       then I got. Oh Lord, my ole feet, get cold so easy out there.” Can you imagine me out there
       running from the World Council of Churches, tonight? Oh my, “Lord it feels so good in here
       around the fire!” Lord sometimes, I think and get a little anxious and I say, “Bring it on Lord!”
       When I get to think about it, “Lord have mercy upon me and help me.” Oh, I say sometimes,
       “Lord, don’t let me be like Peter and run like a Rabbit.” Oh, I tell yeah, it’s something to think
       about!
        The little Bride of Christ in this end-time, is not gonna have ONE THING TO DO WITH
       THAT WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES, BROTHER! If it means houses, lands and lots
       THEY’LL GIVE THEM UP!
        Oh, but I’m watching it! But they’ll be rising great prophets in that day, False prophets. And
       they’ll tell you it’ll all right to keep your house and they’ll fight for you and everything, trying
       for you to keep your material blessings. And that’s gonna be one trick of the devil. And oh, I
       prayin that God will help me, when that hour rises up. That I can stand faithful, to the word of
       God and hold people straight on God’s word in that day. They’ll rise and a time when the devil
       will anoint preachers, like he never anointed them before.
        Oh, I tell yeah brother, when you bring this thing down to bread and butter, it’ll get hot. When
       you bring it down to houses lands and lots. And bring it right down till, the ole devil gets ahold
       of your flesh, I TELL YOU YOU’LL HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING REAL DOWN ON THE
       INSIDE! Why, we’re so used to our big inner spring mattresses and our cars and plenty of food
       and everything. When it comes down and they take your house, and we spend our time planting
       
       19
       our flowers and our trees and painting our houses and getting nice furniture. And then that World
       Council of Churches come in and take it all. They’ll say, “Now, Brother Lambert you don’t have
       to give up this house, you know! We’re not asking you to believe like we do Mr. Lambert. No,
       you go on and preach just like you want to preach! But of course, now you have to belong to the
       World Council of Churches or you can’t keep your church open.” Oh, friend it’ll come so easy!
        One of these mornings when you get up, this thing will slip over you so easy. Isn’t this nation
       goin Bankrupt so easy? It’s coming to pass, right before your eyes. The brothers tell me, “They
       can hardly sell tires now, only thing they can sell now is recaps”, because the Economy is so bad.
       Remember, have not we’ve preached that and preached that? And I preached that way back there
       in the 1950’s.
        Let me tell you something, your pastor in 1958 stood and told them preachers and the
       congregation at the Full Gospel Business and places around the country and they thought I was
       nuts and thought I was fanatic. I said, “The day will come, when they’ll draw your blood out for
       what I’m preaching.” Oh they said, “He’s had a…Oh my!” Oh, wait and see! I said, “This
       country will go flat broke and they’ll sell her out one day.” And I said, “If you don’t watch out
       preachers, you’ll sell your birthright out, just like Esau did so quick, you won’t know what your
       doin.”
        You’re right up to that place brother and sister. Our economy is gone, you may get up in the
       morning and it’ll be totally Bankrupt and no way at all to pull it out. They’ve primed it and
       primed it and primed it, till they can’t prime it any longer. There’s no Nixon’s, I don’t care who
       he is or what his name is, he cannot pull this thing out, it’s a sinking Titanic! It’s goin under!
        And the Russians are gonna take it over, as sure as the world after the Catholic’s take it over.
       But the Catholic’s are gonna take it over first. And that ole Pope what a liar he is! I said, “He’s a
       liar! I SAID, HE’S A LIAR!” You say, “He’s talking about them nice Catholic’s.” You’d never
       get me to kiss his toe I’d bite it, if I’d do anything. No sir! No sir! Go over there and bow down.
       You know I would! He’s the devil himself. When I look at him, I see ole Lucifer. He’s Lucifer
       the devil and don’t know it.
        Oh, what are they gonna do? This thing will come so slick. There will be many of person’s
       that heard the prophet of God, will get a hold of that thing, it’ll come so slick! You remember
       what I’m tell'in you brother, when it comes down to your house, your bread and butter. you’ll
       have to have something DOWN ON THE INSIDE!
        I remember the words of the great James and John and all those great apostles, Peter said,
       “Lord though all these rest of these other preachers forsake you, I’ll never do it! I’ll die with
       you” Jesus said, “Before the cock crows, you’ll deny me!” Oh, brother let me tell you something,
       they was BRAVE! They was brave, until it come down to the very hour and the devils and the
       demons of hell come up and stood on their shoulders.
       Matthew 26:33-Reference quote:
       33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I
       never be offended.
       34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt
       deny me thrice.
       35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said
       all the disciples.
       
       20
        And when that great council that day come into that garden, on the mount of olives there. And
       that preacher run up there and kissed the one that was causing all the trouble and said, “Master”
       Jesus said, “Betrayeth me with a kiss?”
       Matthew 26:47-49-Reference quote;
       47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with
       swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
       48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he:
       hold him fast.
       49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
        And when they all ran to grab a hold of Jesus, why then Peter with one great desperate lounge
       cut off one of the high priest’s ear. Then what happen? Then all of them ran! Ran!
       Matthew 26:50-52-Reference quote:
       50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on
       Jesus and took him.
       51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword,
       and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
       52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the
       sword shall perish with the sword.
        And oh, brother and sister, if not but for the Grace of God, when this thing comes down to
       houses lands and lots and bread and butter. HEAR ME! IF YOU DON’T HAVE SOMETHING
       DOWN ON THE INSIDE, LOOK OUT!
        Oh brother, the Bible said, “That day father will deliver up son to be put to death. And son
       will deliver up father to death! AND THEY WILL COME AND THEY WILL KILL YOU and
       think they did God a service. That day will come, as sure as I STAND HERE and look at you
       and preach to you tonight!
       Matthew 10:21-Reference quote:
       21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the
       children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
       John 16:2-Reference quote:
       2 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will
       think that he doeth God service.
        BUT OH, IN THAT HOUR! OH, God! THERE WILL RISE UP GREAT PROPHETS just
       like it was in the days of old, WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND A THUNDERBOLT OF
       LIGHTNING and shake this thing! Yes, they will!

       58-1012 - The Sudden, Secret Going Away Of The Church
       William Marrion Branham
       “She has made Herself ready.” 105 I’ve shown you the wickedness. And the time would
       not…would fail me, to go through the ages, and show that each time, like in Babylon on the night
       of the rioting, and dancing and drinking, and so forth, and what happened. And down through
       the age it’s been that way. In every age God has had thunderbolt prophets, with signs and
       wonders, to condemn the thing in the midst of all popularity, and stand alone for God. 106 Not
       only that, but what if I would speak of the time of little Stephens, not a prophet, not a pastor, just
       a member of the Body of Christ. How that this little fellow stood before the Sanhedrin Council
       that morning, and spoke out to those who were condemning him, and said, “You stiff-necks,
       uncircumcised in the heart and ears. You do always resist the Holy Ghost. As your fathers did, so
       do you.” He wasn’t a pastor. 107 You can’t expect your pastor to do it all. You can’t expect your
       trustee board to do it all, or your deacon board. You’ve got to make yourself ready. It’s an
       individual affair. 108 And, remember, His Coming is so sudden, that the Church will go in a
       twinkling of an eye. And if we see sin on every hand, and judgment pending, and the
       battleships of God’s wrath coming, how we escape this? Signs are appearing. Jesus is coming.
       And great wonders are being done. Every mile post is pointing towards His soon appearing,
       and it’ll happen in a moment. 109 How are we standing, this morning, as we take inventory? If
       we should be spoke to, this morning, and the Lord Jesus should descend from the heavens, this
       morning, with the Shout and the Trump of God, would we be found ready, as a church body?
       Would we be found ready, as an individual, to join with those who are raised from the dead, who
       have proven themselves ready? No matter whether we are ready or not, the Lord Jesus will
       come just the same, at the appointed time. We must be ready, and we must do it now. It is no
       time to wait. We must redeem the time and be ready.

       61-1119 - Perfect Strength By Perfect Weakness
       William Marrion Branham
       352 Who’s strong enough? What kind of a—of a denomination is able to conquer him walking up
       and down through these tombstones of denominations, crying, “The days of miracles is past, and
       we don’t need the Holy Ghost”? 353 And who can tame that devil? God! We can’t do it by
       denomination. We can’t do it by ecclesiastical forces. But there was a Voice one time that did it,
       amen, that tamed them devils, put them in their right mind and put clothes on them. That
       same Voice give us a promise, “The works that I do shall you do also.” You’ll never do it under
       ecclesiastical gasoline in a carbon-struck car. You’ll never do it in a organization. You’ll do it
       when you empty up and become weak, pour out all yourself, and let the Holy Ghost come in
       and flutter every part of you, saturate every lid of your body. That’s the only…do it. We don’t
       need a new organization. 354 What we need, O God, I feel It pouring in around through here
       now. What we need is a prophet of God to rise up with a thunderbolt of God, spiritual
       lightning that’ll shake this world to shame! Hallelujah! Empty vessel is what He needs, that’s
       right, a called-out Church, a little minority that’ll receive God’s power and blessings and His
       Message. Hallelujah! That’s what we need. 355 Get weak so you can get strong. It’ll conquer
       every devil. It’ll put the learned to shame. It’ll bring men and women who God has called, and
       
       22
       that only. 356 Remember, “As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the coming of the Son of
       man, eight souls was saved.” In the days of Elijah there was seven thousand only had It. Oh, just
       think of where we’re living now. When John came on the scene, the little church was certainly in
       the minority, but there was empty vessels to pour the Oil in. Hallelujah! God, let us empty
       ourselves up. 357 Get empty, friends. Get weak! Deny your own ability! And you out in
       radio…not radio, but out in…that hear these tapes, wherever they come, empty yourselves out.
       Pour yourselves out upon God’s altar as a sacrifice. Let the Angel come with a coal of Fire,
       fill that vessel with the power of Almighty God. Get…Then He’ll make you strong, He’ll give
       you grace to stand.
        Brother, the word will stabilize the little Bride in that hour, brother. And then need be, she’ll
       go with a martyr’s crown, just as TRIUMPHANT as they did back there. UNDER ALL THE
       GREAT HERO’S AND ALL OF THEM, THEM THAT WE’RE FEED TO THE LION’S AND
       FED THEM THEN TO FIRE, they stood fast! And it’ll happen again!
        God told me so, it’ll be here! Oh, in that day, the power of God will be glorious upon the little
       Bride! SHE’LL RISE TO THE HEIGHTS OF ALL THE POWER OF GOD IN THAT HOUR.
       When they begin to take those things away from you. He’ll not only be our Savior, but he’ll be
       our provider, our protector and our resurrect'tor. Oh, to see his name glorified.
        Oh, what is it? Oh, it’s a materialistic hour we’re living in. Oh, we Americans are so soft!
       Listen we don’t know what it is…When I go out of our country and I go over in those other
       places, I come out in a state of shock. You go and there’s thousands and hundreds of thousands,
       of little children walking along and that haven’t had a meal in a week. Grown men with nothing
       but skin over their bones. Trying to work to get a potato to eat. You go in their houses and they
       don’t even have a cupboard to put food in. They don’t have no salt no pepper, they ain’t got
       nothing to put it on. They don’t know where their next meal is coming from.
        And we got more food out in the garbage can! The poorest of the poor people in America are
       Rockefeller’s to the people of the world. And then they don’t care a thing about God. We
       Americans are the lousiest people upon the face of the earth at this time. We’re spoiled rotten,
       see! People of America love a Cadillac, they love the big fine homes. They don’t know what it is
       to go without a meal. While the people of the world, in other places of the world are starving. Oh
       God! How we should always thank the Lord God, for our food. How he’s blessed us and never
       let us go hungry.
        And to think, how America has turned from God. As I told my children, “People in America
       don’t want the gospel, they don’t want God! They want a religion that suits their way. That’s let
       them be soft and doody and live any way they want, just go to church as it’s convenient. Have
       the power of God if it don’t cost anything.”
        Oh my, when I think of places like Red China and Russia, those poor little peasants back
       there, that don’t know nothing but hardship and labor and heartache. Don’t know, what
       happiness and Joy is!
        When I think, “Oh God, if you could anoint me with the power of the Holy Ghost and PICK
       ME UP LIKE YOU DID PHILIP, AND SIT ME DOWN IN RED CHINA AND LET ME
       PREACH THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST.” Oh, what a blessing! To see them little souls crying out,
       so hungry for God! That’s always been my hearts cry! And God knows I’ve wept and cried till
       my eyes have been swollen together. Many Many nights I’ve wept and I’ve cried, “GOD
       PLEASE! I BEG YOU LORD, LET ME GET OUT OF AMERICA! TAKE ME OUT OF HERE
       LORD, DON’T LET ME WASTE MY WHOLE LIFE here in this stinkin' country! People don’t
       
       23
       want God, all they want is a bigger car, bigger home, a bigger this and a bigger that. Take me
       over there Lord, where them poor people never heard THE NAME OF JESUS!” I’ve stayed here
       so long, with the rest of us, I DON’T HAVE NO BURDEN FOR SOULS ANY MORE.
        I think of how years ago, how I use to lay and cry and fast and never eat. My ribs would show
       and my eyes would be sunk back in my head and red all the time. And everybody thinkin' I was
       crazy. Going from door to door, wouldn’t even go home and eat. Goin from door to door, crying
       tryin to get somebody to except Jesus! All they wanted was a bottle of Gin and a different car
       and this and that. Until I staggered back in my home and woke up one morning to find out, I had
       no more burden for souls. HOW CAN YOU HAVE A BURDEN FOR SOULS, WHEN THE
       SOULS DON’T EVEN WANT GOD, IN THIS GOD FORSAKEN UNDEGENERATED
       BUNCH OF ADULTEROUS AND FORNICATORS. That’s all they are!
        The whole world is lost without God, and never heard of the name of Jesus. You talk about
       Red China! Let me tell yea, only one percent of Red China is communism. Them people brother
       would eat up, what we hearin' tonight.
        Oh God, how I long, to see that memory roll around! YOU BARE ME RECORD! THIS
       GREAT WORD MINISTRY, WON’T LAST LONG HERE! GOD’S SICK AND TIRED AND
       FED UP, with the way people are acting in this country.
        One of these days brother, when his servants makes this last call through America, and he’ll
       start ripping AND A TARING! It’ll be the wrath of God, belching and with his very hand he’ll
       do it! And he’ll take it out of here and it’ll be gone.
        And they’ll go right on preaching thinking, they’ll gonna do this and that and their lost. And
       the Gospel will go to the rest of the world, that haven’t heard. Hundreds of thousands will gather
       to hear the word! And it’ll go to other nations.
        Oh Lord, the only thing that gives my ole heart any peace…I have to stay here and suffer like
       this today, strain and struggle and try to go on. Just hardly enough little anointing to get up and
       preach with. And go back home and wait and cry, “Lord GOD, HOW LONG WILL IT BE
       BEFORE you do this great thing!” Yet I know, that in this dirty filthy country that’s so rotten in
       sin as it is, I know that in here is a little elected Bride somewhere! That’s the only thing, that
       keeps you goin on.
        “Know that all these things are gonna work together for good, to them that Love God and are
       called according to his purpose.”
       Romans 8:28-Referernce quote:
       28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
       the called according to his purpose.
        Oh, dearly beloved, how we NEED TO SEARCH OUR HEARTS! Search our hearts before
       the Lord. Oh, how we ought to thank him and praise him for all these good things he has done
       for us. God’s got a purpose in your life. A purpose that he’s purposed before the foundation of
       the world. And the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. And all these trials and all
       these circumstances that happen to you, will work out for the good, to those that Love God. And
       everything in the future that happens to you, will be for good. I don’t care how it upsets you and
       how hard it hurts you, it’ll be for good.
       Psalms 37:23-Reference quote:
       23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.

       28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
       the called according to his purpose.
        Why is because you’re not sitting here tonight saved by the grace of God, because it was your
       will! Everything about you was contrary to God. And you would of not even repented, if God
       hadn’t gave you repentance. Oh, you say, “Oh, I repented Lord!” You couldn’t of even repented,
       if God hadn’t gave it to you! So, it’s all the grace of God. The grace of God!
        And he had a purpose before the foundation of the world, that tell us in Romans 8:29. His
       purpose was, he wants to conform YOU to his very image.
       Romans 8:29-Reference quote:
       29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son,
       that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
        Think about, what a blessed thing this is! In an hour when the people are conformed to the
       world. Their so conformed to the world! And oh my, and it’s so hard to get over today! See
       that’s why, that I say the things that I do, about the styles. I have no scripture for men wearing
       hairstyles. The only thing I got is the scripture that says, “It’s a shame for a man to ware long
       hair.”
        But the thing about it, when we see people in this country, that’s…Let me tell you something,
       we’re the sinners. Those that sat and heard this great glorious light, are the greatest sinners that’s
       in United States. We’re the great sinners!
        When I see that every kind of style comes by… And people that claim to be the people of
       God, organize themselves over to that style. Where the long sideburns come out, all the men get
       long sideburns. The long hairdos come out, and men’s hair begins to get long, see. And the
       president’s wife, whatever kind of hairdo… I can’t remember what they called it. When women
       used to stand the hair way up high, you know. They ratted them all up, whatever they call it, you
       know. Then they can’t hardly sleep at night because they don’t want to mess that up, see. They
       put all kinds of lacquer on it. Oh, for what good is it, see?
        And then, if the preacher says anything about it… I’ve seen them get up and walk out by the
       scores, you know. Oh, they’ll speak in tongues, sing, I’ve seen them cry.
        You know, there was one time when people would cry and cry that would move me. And I
       would cry for them. That’s wonderful, you cry I’ll cry, you laugh, I’ll laugh. And then, I thought
       that was God. Then until, I find out the people go to the movies and they’ll cry. People read a
       book and they’ll cry. People that are religious, will Cry. But oh, what do you do when you hear
       the word of God? Oh, for them tears that drip down peoples faces because there’re hearing the
       word of God and it’s so good to them they cry. That’s the kind tears, that I want to see! See, but
       what does that mean?
        No, not to be conformed to this world, but to be transformed. Don’t be conformed to the
       world but be conformed to the image, of the Lord Jesus Christ. In an hour when people are living
       such a terrible life and what a glorious hour when the Lord God of heaven conform you to the
       very image, of his son Jesus. I believe that’s the kind of people that he’s coming after. After a
       people that have been conformed, to his very image. His very image! This is God’s plan and
       purpose before the foundation of the world, is to conform you to his very Image.
       
       25
        Now, every child of God that’s here today that’s foreordained by the purpose of God, you
       have got to find what is that great mystery of his will for you. He’s got something that he want’s
       you to do! So, therefore he is conforming you to his very image. Oh, how blessed! See, that he
       would want to conform you to his image. People say, “I don’t think, that we could ever be in the
       image of Jesus.” I do! I believe, that the little bride will look just like the Lord Jesus Christ in
       character when she leaves here.

       361 Then the Word, coming from Here, manifests Itself through each one of these beings, see,
       and makes this complete Being a Tabernacle of the living God, a walking, living example of
       Christianity. What Christ was, these people are, because His Life is in here. They are in Christ.
       And their life is dead and hid in Christ, through God, and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost.
       First Corinthians 12. That’s right. See? You reckon yourself dead, then you’re born of faith.
       Then virtue and these other things is added to you till you’re a perfect, living image of God.
       That wonderful? [Congregation says, “Amen.”—Ed.] 362 And then God, through that, has
       brought also Seven Church Ages, to show the seven steps that He brought, building His
       individual into His image, He’s built a complete Church in His image. And at the
       resurrection, this complete Body will be raised up to live with Him forever, because it is a
       Bride. See? So that cuts in every age, every age that come.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       Here is what I am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth
       after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let the earth bring forth
       grass, and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
       itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and
       thence into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the
       church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. In these last
       days the true Bride Church (Christ’s seed) will come to the Headstone, and she will be the
       super church, a super race, as she nears Him. They in the bride will be so much like Him that
       they will even be in His very image. This is in order to be united with Him. They will be one.
       They will be the very manifestation of the Word of the living God. Denominations cannot
       produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their dogmas, mixed with the
       Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product.

       61-0210 - Abraham's Covenant Confirmed
       William Marrion Branham
       116 But notice in building the pyramid… Now, watch this. You got a dollar bill in your pocket?
       I—I think I got one. So if you notice on the back of your dollar bill, why have they got the
       
       26
       pyramid says, “The Great Seal?” You ever notice it on your American dollar? Um-hum. “The
       Great Seal.” Notice on that pyramid also, how it starts at the bottom and keeps coming up like
       this, minority, minority. And did you notice, the capstone’s not even on it. Neither is the pyramid
       capped. Why? The Capstone was rejected, Jesus Christ, the Head of it, exactly right. 117 Now,
       notice, in the Lutheran age, what did we live? Justification, way down here at the bottom,
       planting the foundation stones, Luther; Wesley, we believed in sanctification, to come into the
       minority; Pentecost, still the baptism of the Holy Ghost, up in the minority. But watch, the
       Church that goes right out to the end of it, right out at the end of that, that Church is going to
       have to be so perfectly like the ministry of Jesus Christ, till when that stone comes, it sets right
       smack in the groove. Oh, Hallelujah! Oh. 118 If you can catch it and know what I’m talking
       about, the very ministry that Jesus Christ was doing here on earth, when it comes back, the
       very same ministry He had, Pentecost will not have to widen itself out in organization, but
       shape itself up in Christ until the Headstone and the Church will fit one to the other. And
       them is so cemented, till you can’t even take a razor blade and go around and find the crack
       where they were put together. And that’s how the Church is got to come, so much like Christ.
       And look what we got to do then. Cut away and circumcise and chop off, and form and molded
       into the image of Jesus Christ until that Church and the Cap comes right smack together. 119
       Look at my hand on a shadow on the wall. When it’s away from me, it’s scattered out. As it
       comes, it becomes more closer. There’s not a great big fingers, it’s getting smaller and smaller
       and smaller, getting darker and darker and darker, until the shadow, the negative and the
       positive becomes one. And that’s the way it is in the Coming, the Church has got to shape itself
       till it hasn’t got a spot or wrinkle in it. Amen. There is that second Bible.
       
        You know naked we come into the world, as the psalms of David said, “Naked we come into
       the world.” But there’s one thing about brother, we’re goin out here with something. You may
       not take your house or you can’t take your car and you can’t take your bank account, you may
       not be able to take one of your loved ones, but there is something that you’re going to take out
       here, if you go! And that is, the character of the Lord Jesus.
        And to think about it, that he has called us and foreordained us and predestinated us to be
       conformed to his very image. And oh, now if we could only just yield ourselves to that. If we
       could only not be so mindful about anything else in the world, because all that’ll pass away. But
       if only we could be so mindful, that we could yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit that he could
       conform us to the Lord Jesus. Ain’t that wonderful? And then see the whole family conformed
       to the Lord Jesus, that they might be together as a family over in the millennium.
        I was talking to my little daughter in the study the other night. I love my children! Where I go
       and I’m goin… Where I go, I want them to go! And I was tellin them, that if they don’t get
       married and they stay single, then I believe as a family we’ll all be together over in the
       millennium. On this earth right here, in the millennium we’ll all be together as a family. See!
       Won’t that be wonderful! And I said, “I might be stationed in Russia and you'all will be there
       with me. But Jerusalem, will be our headquarters and there is where Jesus will be. And I said,
       “After I stay up there awhile, I’ll say I’ve got to go see Jesus! And I said, “You'all want to go to?
       I said, “We won’t get on a plane, we won’t ride on no boat, we won’t go on a donkey. I’ll just
       think a thought and I’ll be there. And I’ll go down and talk with the Lord Jesus and tell him, how
       everything is goin on up in Russia. I don’t know that I’ll be stationed in Russia, but I’ll be
       stationed somewhere. You’ll be stationed somewhere. And I was kinda makin' a little story and
       my little daughter said, “Daddy, that’s so hard to understand.” “Yes!” But I said, “That’s more
       
       27
       positive and more real than what we got right now.” I said, “One time, hundreds of years ago if
       somebody said, “That you we’re gonna sit here in the house” … Which we don’t have one. “And
       you’d be sitting there looking at a little thing called a television and see people that’s way over in
       Africa. And see the color clothes they got, and hear them talk and see everything they do,
       thousands of miles away on a little square box just plugged into the electricity. You couldn’t of
       believed it! No matter if they told you how it worked and everything, you couldn’t…It’d seem
       like a fairytale a fantasy.” But I said, “Television always was. It didn’t just begin the last few
       years. It always was!” God always had television, ether waves was always here. Every time you
       move your hand, that’s on Gods television. And everything that you ever done. You stole an egg
       out of the hen’s nest, it’ll be there on that day. Every word that go out in the atmosphere, they’re
       right there. From the time you started sayin, 'Da'da, ma' ma' it’s right there. And then right there
       when you started cussing and using the Lord name in vain, it’s right there. Every dirty filthy joke
       you ever told, is right there. Every wicked act that you’ve ever done is right there, both word and
       action, is right there. And in Gods great day at the white throne judgement, he will call that forth
       and there will you be on Gods television coming right up there before him. Not only your picture
       but will be your voice talking, from the time you started to talk. Oh, children of God if you’re
       thinking of all those things you’ve done, is gonna come out. Oh…Children of God! I’m sure
       your thanking of all the things that you done is gonna come out. I’m so thankful that he took all
       them dirty words that I said and every evil thing that I ever done, HE PUT THEM ON CHRIST
       AND POURED HIS WRATH OUT UPON HIM AT CALVARY! Hallelujah! Put all those
       things in the sea of his forgetfulness and now they’re not even to be remembered by the Lord any
       more. Do you love him with all your heart? (Amen)

       63-1114 - Influence
       William Marrion Branham
       107 God’s omnipresence knows what you’re doing, and even your thoughts. One time while I
       was in a vision, I was speaking to a Being standing by me; and He said back, He said, “Your
       thoughts are louder in the Heavens than your voice is on the earth.” He knows what you’re
       thinking. You might say you—you do this and you do that, and it, but, you see, down in your
       heart, if you think different, you’re—you’re doing something wrong. You should be just what
       you are, see, the—the heart. The mouth should speak what’s in the heart. See? And so we find
       that the people doesn’t realize the—the Presence of God. 108 You know, they ought to be like
       David, the man was after God’s Own heart. He said, “The Lord is always before me.” Wherever
       he goes, he remembers God is always before him. “He is on my right hand, and I’ll not be
       moved,” because God is on his right hand. 109 Reverence! We ought to honor one another,
       respect one another, as brother, sister. And love one another, with undying love. You say, “Well,
       I just can’t.” Well, just stay here a little longer, and then you will like people, too. You’ll love
       those who doesn’t love you. That’s really a good sign of Christianity: when you can, from your
       heart, love those who does not love you. Love the unloveable. 110 Jesus said, “If you just do
       favors for those that do favors for you, well, the publicans do the same thing.” But, see, you must
       be kind to those who are unkind to you. Do good for those that would do evil to you. Always
       remember that. Keep that before you, that God is watching you. Remember, God was good to
       
       28
       you when you were evil to Him. “While you were yet sinners, Christ died for you.” 111 Now we
       find out, that, these wings over Their faces was because They were in the Presence of God,
       reverent. And if a holy Seraphim has to hide His face behind special covering, the One who
       knows no sin, never sinned, but yet in the Presence of the Holy God has to hide His holy face in
       the Presence of God, what is a hypocrite going to do on that Day? What is the backslider going
       to do on that Day? What’s the ungodly going to do on that Day, when you come? And you’re
       going to have to face Him. 112 There is only one thing. You say, “But He never made me wings
       to cover my face.” But He shed the Blood of His Own Son, that you could cover your face with.
       That’s right. That’s His only covering that He has for the human race, is the Blood of Jesus
       Christ.
       
        Now, there is only one thing that can go there and remove those ether waves. There’s only
       one thing that can go out there and take those words away, and that’s the Lord himself. Oh my,
       when I think of it, when you are dipped down in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and God
       reaches out there with his mighty hand and gets all those dirty filthy things and takes them away.
       And all those other images and everything and puts them in the sea of his forgetfulness. And he’s
       so great, the blood of God is so great, that when that’s applied to you, that God can’t even
       remember your sins anymore. You stand perfect before the Lord God.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 5 - The Pergamean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       And there it is. You CAN’T claim that manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit-born, Spiritfilled. No sir. I will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing mighty
       acts, but it is NOT the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled, even though that individual
       has an abundance of those manifestations. The evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just
       the same as it was back in the day of our Lord. It is receiving the Word of truth for the day in
       which you live. Jesus never did stress the importance of the Works as He did the Word. He knew
       that if the people got the WORD the works would follow. That is Bible. Now Jesus knew that
       there was going to be a terrible drift away from the Word in the Pergamean Age which was as
       yet two hundred years off from the Patmos vision. He knew that drift would cause them to go into
       the Dark Ages. He knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the
       Word. If you leave that Word, you have left God. Thus He is presenting Himself to the church at
       Pergamos, and indeed to all churches of all ages, “I am the Word. If you want Deity in your
       midst, then welcome and receive the Word. Don’t ever let anyone or anything get between you
       and that Word. This which I am giving you (the Word) is a revelation of Myself. I AM THE
       WORD. Remember that!” I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the Word in our midst.
       Let me give you a thought here. How do we pray? We pray in Jesus Name don’t we? Every
       prayer is in His Name or there isn’t any answer. Yet in I John 5:14 we are told, “This is the
       confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us:
       and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we
       desired of Him.” Now we ask, “What is the will of God?” There is only ONE WAY to know His
       will and that is by the WORD OF GOD. Lamentations 3:37, “Who is he that saith, and it cometh
       to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?” There it is. If it isn’t in the Word you can’t have it.
       So we can’t ask unless it’s in the Word, and we can’t petition or ask unless it is in His Name.
       There it is again. JESUS (the Name) is the WORD (will). You can’t separate God and the Word.
       They are ONE. Now then, this Word He has left behind on the printed page is a part of Him
       when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life. He said that His Word was life. John 6:63b.
       But that is exactly what He is: John 14:6, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.” Romans 8:9b,
       “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” There it is, He is Spirit and He is
       Life. That is exactly what the Word is; that is exactly what Jesus is. He is the Word. So when a
       Spirit-born, Spirit-filled man in faith takes that Word into his heart and places it upon his lips,
       why that is the same as Deity speaking. Every mountain has to go. Satan cannot stand before
       
       30
       that man. If the church, way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the
       living Word in their midst, the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages.
       And right today, when the church returns to the Word in faith, we can say without doubt that
       the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again. One night as I was
       seeking the Lord, the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write. As I grasped the pen to
       write, His Spirit gave me a message for the church. I want to bring it to you. It has to do with the
       Word and the bride. Here is what I am trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each
       specie brings forth after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11, “And God said, Let the
       earth bring forth grass, and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind,
       whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.” Whatever life was in the seed came forth
       into a plant and thence into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed
       started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. In
       these last days the true Bride Church (Christ’s seed) will come to the Headstone, and she will
       be the super church, a super race, as she nears Him. They in the bride will be so much like
       Him that they will even be in His very image. This is in order to be united with Him. They will
       be one. They will be the very manifestation of the Word of the living God. Denominations
       cannot produce this (wrong seed). They will produce their creeds and their dogmas, mixed with
       the Word. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. The first son (Adam) was the spoken
       seed-Word of God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. That is why the bride was given
       to him, to reproduce himself; to produce another son of God. But she fell. She fell by
       hybridization. She caused him to die. The second Son (Jesus), also a spoken Seed-Word of God
       was given a bride like as was Adam. But before He could marry her, she also had fallen. She,
       like Adam’s wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God and live, or
       doubt the Word and die. She doubted. She left the Word. She died. From a little group of the
       true seed of the Word, God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is a virgin of His
       Word. She is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas. By and through the
       members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the
       virgin. The word of promise came to the virgin Mary. But that Word of promise was He,
       Himself, to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He, Himself, acted at that time and
       fulfilled His own Word of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had brought her the
       message. But the angel’s message was the Word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He fulfilled at that time
       all that was written of Him because she accepted His Word to her. The members of the virgin
       bride will love Him, and they will have His potentials, for He is their head, and all power
       belongs to Him. They are subject to Him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads.
       Notice the harmony of the Father and the Son. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed
       Him by the Father. John 5:19. This harmony is now to exist between the Groom and His bride.
       He shows her His Word of life. She receives it. She never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can
       harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here is
       the secret of this. The Word is in the bride (as it was in Mary). The bride has the mind of
       Christ for she knows what He wants done with the Word. She performs the command of the
       Word in His name for she has “thus saith the Lord.” Then the Word is quickened by the Spirit
       and it comes to pass. Like a seed that is planted and watered, it comes to full harvest, serving its
       purpose. Those in the bride do only His will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have
       “thus saith the Lord” or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works,
       fulfilling His own Word. He did not complete all His work while in His earthly ministry so now
       He works in and through the bride. She knows that, for it was not yet time for Him to do certain
       
       31
       things that He must now do. But He will now fulfill through the bride that work which He left
       for this specific time.
        And now, we are gonna have a ministry just like the Lord Jesus on the earth. When the little
       bride takes her flight. The little bride we’ll be carrying on the same ministry of the Lord Jesus.

       65-0418M - It Is The Rising Of The Sun
       William Marrion Branham
       109 But there has got to come One! Hallelujah! There has to come a real Bride! There must
       come One that’s not only got the Mechanics, but the Dynamics of It, makes that Church live,
       move in the Power of His resurrection. Until we come to that place, until we find that place,
       what good does it do to polish the hubs? What good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonize
       job, when there’s no Dynamics in it? No matter how much the Mechanics prove to be right, there
       has got to be a Dynamics to make It work. 110 That’s what He proved! Hallelujah! That’s what
       Easter proved. He wasn’t only the Word, but He was God Himself, the Dynamics, in the Word.
       That made the body of Jesus Christ (cold, stiff, and dead, in the grave) shake into Life and rise
       again, and roll away the stone. “I am He that was dead,” so dead till the sun said He was
       dead, the moon said He was dead, the stars said He was dead. All nature said He was dead.
       And now the whole world has to recognize that He’s alive again. He was not only the
       Mechanics, God’s Word, He was the Dynamics to prove It. 111 And as He, being the Groom,
       the Bride has to come forth, ’cause It’s part of Him. And It can only be the manifestation of
       the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride; It can only manifest. If it
       does something different from the Groom, it isn’t the Bride. Because, She is flesh of His flesh,
       bone of His bone; Life of His Life, Power of His Power! She is Him! As man and woman are
       one, and woman taken from his side; She had taken a Spirit, the feminish Spirit, from Him. The
       flesh from His side, made both Mechanics and Dynamics, the Wife. The Spirit of Him and the
       flesh of Him, and put it together, and made Mechanics and Dynamics. Until the church or the
       people… 112 All these Easter bunnies, and ceremonies, and big churches, and finery, will fail
       and pass away. 113 Until that Church becomes both Dynamics and Mechanics; and the Spirit
       of God, that moved Him, to do the things that He did! If He hit on sixteen cylinders, so will the
       Bride. Amen! For He said, in John 14:12, “He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall
       he do also. I’ll give him a charge of My Dynamics, in his Mechanics, that the world will not be
       able to withstand it; and I’ll raise him up again at the last day.” That’s the Easter Message, the
       Dynamics and the Mechanics, together! The Mechanics without the Dynamics, no good; neither
       is the Dynamics, without the Mechanics. 114 You can scream and shout, and jump up-and-down,
       all you want to, and deny this Word, it won’t do any good. You’re just cranking around the—the
       pistons of…Got the spark there to fire, but no gasoline to fire it by. 115 It’ll only work as they
       come together. Amen! So, one will set still, and the other One will go up. That’s the only thing
       there is to it. Yet, they both might look alike, both claim to be churches, both claim to be Bride.
       But One has Mechanics and Dynamics, It brings it to pass, of what He said is the Truth. 116 It
       just won’t move, no matter how good the Mechanics is, until the Dynamics come. When the
       Dynamics come, that Fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline. And when That
       explodes, it causes a combustion, and that combustion moves every motion, every move, for He
       is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That’s the resurrection. That’s the real Power of

       God, Mechanics with the Dynamics. Notice, “It’s the Spirit that quickens.” It’s the—it’s the
       Spark that fires. It’s not the gas that fires; it’s the Spark that fires the gas. See? 117 “You can
       do nothing without Me; but with Me you can do all things.” As He is the Word, It’s the Father
       living. “Father sent Me, so send I you. As the Father has fired Me and pushed Me into
       everything, I do only that which is pleasing to God. Now, as He sent Me, so send I you with the
       same Mechanics, and it takes the same Dynamics to operate It. And these signs shall follow
       them that claim to have the Mechanics. The Dynamics will take Its place.” 118 Paul said,
       “The Gospel came to us not in Word only,” through gasoline only, “but through Spark also,”
       to make It move. There you are. It came to us in that manner. 119 It’s the same Spirit, that
       raised Him up, that quickened the true believer to Eternal Life. Now remember,
       potentially…Now watch, as we are getting out of our time. Notice, “the same Spirit,” now,
       Romans 8:1. Now let’s just read that again, in Romans 8:1, and we’ll see what that says. All
       right. And not Romans…I mean, 8:11, I’m sorry. 120 In Romans 8:11, “But if…” There is the
       problem. There’s His catch. But if the Spirit of him (God, the Holy Spirit) that raised up Jesus
       from the dead dwell in you,… 121 Now, there you are, “If the Bridegroom Spirit dwells in the
       Bride!” 122 When God made His first bridegroom, He made the bridegroom first, and he was
       both man and woman, in spirit; formed him in the dust of the earth, to make him material. And
       notice when He made Eve, from Adam, He took not another piece of clay, He took from the same
       piece of clay; the same Word, for Adam was a spoken Word. See? He took from him, and then
       taken the…He had masculine and feminish spirit. And He took the feminish spirit away from
       Adam, and placed it in Eve; so it’s still part of Adam’s spirit, it’s Adam’s flesh. Then, it was
       Adam’s spirit, the dynamic, that quickened the mechanics of his body. 123 So the Bride must
       also be flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone. Then how is this mortal flesh going to become
       His flesh? We’ll get to it in a minute, see. How is it done? How? What is this great
       transformation? Notice. Now if the Spirit of him (God) that raised up Jesus from the dead
       dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
       his Spirit that dwelleth in you. 124 Oh, my! The predestinated One, of course, like the Seed
       laid upon the earth, the One that had Life in them. Many of them were dead; they were just
       rotten seed; the waters and things burnt them out. But, you know, there was a Seed laying
       there ready for Life. God knowed It was laying there. 125 Now, the predestinated Ones are the
       first to be quickened by the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit comes to claim Its Own. Now, this is
       deep now, and be sure to catch this good.

       61-0210 - Abraham's Covenant Confirmed
       William Marrion Branham
       176 He said, “By this you’ll know what My covenant is, Abraham.” Abraham being spiritual
       knowed it. Why? That’s exactly what God did. He took His covenant Seed, which the real Seed
       was the promised One through faith, come forth out of Isaac, come forth Christ. Christ was
       God’s Covenant. And what He did, He took Him up to Calvary, just like Abraham did his own
       son a few days afterwards, or a few years afterwards, after he was born. What did He do? He
       took Him on Calvary and He tore Him apart (Amen.), tore Him apart. He raised His body up
       on Easter morning and set Him on the right hand of His throne. But the Spirit that was in
       Him, He sent back down to the church. So the church, when this Covenant is brought into its
       full strength, when the Covenant is confirmed with God, the church, the people that goes into
       
       33
       this body here to be His Bride, will be exactly the same Spirit that was upon Christ, doing the
       same things, the same ministry, the same power, and it’ll come together and be Word by Word
       the same: confirming the Covenant. 177 Now, look at today; look what we see today and find
       out. What did I say about the pyramid? It’ll have to be honed and so perfectly set in, all the
       shavings and everything, till that headstone will have to fit just perfectly in. See? The rejected
       headstone will have to be come back.
        Now, let’s bow our heads in a word of prayer. While the sisters come to the organ and piano,
       please.
        Oh, How I think Him, how I praise him, that he saved my soul and cleansed me in the
       precious blood of the Lord Jesus. Took all of our transgressions and nail them, to Calvary’s Tree.
       Translated us from the power of darkness, unto the glorious Kingdom of light. Now we are no
       more children of the darkness but the children of the light. How blessed!
        Now, let’s offer a word of prayer to the Lord. While our sister play softly on
       the organ.
        How many would like to be more yielded to the Lord? (Amen) That you could be more
       pliable in the hands of the Holy Spirit, to conform you to his very image.
        Friend think, how many people that’s trying to worship the Lord tonight. Coming up the street
       of little town here in New England, saw all the great buildings down the street. No cars out front
       or out back, Church doors all locked up. Not enough love for the Lord, not enough enthusiasm to
       be in church tonight. More entertaining, more exciting to be home watching television and more
       comfortable.
        But oh my, when the ole boy dies in the church, they’ll preach his funeral and say, “He went
       home to be in heaven with the Lord.” Oh my, filled with hypocrisy! Churchgoers, heady high
       minded, lover of pleasures than lovers of God. Having a form of godliness but denying the power
       of the Holy Ghost.
       2 Timothy 3:4-Reference quote:
       4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
       5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
        Preachers that sold out, for a finer automobile, a bigger this and a bigger that. What good is it
       all. Not knowing, that your soul may be required of the Lord tonight. Oh God! To slip out into
       that great regions of the lost, with no hope. Scream and holler all you wanted to, and there’ll be
       no help at all.
        But oh, to think tonight, we have a blessed hope and an anchor in the word of God that’s
       steadfast and sure. Forsaking the things of the world and loving the things of God. Loving his
       glorious Appearing and Coming.

       62-0521 - Convinced And Then Concerned
       William Marrion Branham
       Notice. There’s a great big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing, and then Jesus coming.
       There’s two different words, means two different things: the appearing of the Lord, and the
       coming of the Lord. Now, the appearing of the Lord is now, when He’s appearing in His
       
       34
       people, His Spirit working among them, proving that it’s Him with them, getting them ready
       for the rapture, for the coming of the Lord to catch away His—the Bride (See?): the appearing
       and the coming. All right. Now. Now, the thing we have to do if we can believe it, and be
       concerned about it, first we’ve got to be convinced that it is God. Then when we’re convinced,
       then we are concerned. I like that. All right. 32 John knew what He would be. He looked for
       Him, because God told him in the wilderness, “There’ll be a sign following Him.” And when
       John saw that sign, he knew that Messiah was standing there somewhere, and he watched it,
       where it went to. And he said, “There’s the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,
       for He that told me in the wilderness, ‘Upon Whom thou shall see the Spirit descending and
       remaining on, He is the One that’ll baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire.’” 33 Now, the Bible
       promises in this last days that these things that you see today would be happening. Then we
       see the appearing of the Messiah in the form of the Holy Spirit in the church. And if the life of
       a—of a pear tree was in a sycamore tree, it would bring the same—it’d bring pears, because the
       life in the tree would be, now, be pear tree life. No matter how big, how little, what form it’s in, it
       would be the same, ’cause the life in it produces the fruit of it. And the fruit of the Spirit follows
       the Spirit, or the Spirit produces the fruit and the signs of the Gospel. Jesus said, “These signs
       shall follow them that believe.” They would do it. And to how long? “To all the world and unto
       every nation.” 34 Andrew, as we read of him here a few moments ago in the coming of the
       Lord… Andrew, he was just an ordinary Hebrew that went over to see—hear John preach, and
       he was sure that this prophet knew what he was talking about. And then, on the scene one day
       came Jesus, and he heard John announce Him, and saying, “There He is. That’s the One
       right there.” And Andrew, he said, “Now, the thing for me to do is to not criticize John, or—or
       take just that, but I’m going to go with Him and find out.” I wish every person in Chicago would
       be that sincere. Now, Andrew stayed with Him all night. Did you notice in that Scripture, he
       abode with Him all night. He stayed until he was convinced. And after he was convinced, then he
       was concerned about somebody else having the same thing he had. 35 But a man’s got to be
       convinced first. And the only convincing thing is the manifestation, or the identity of the Gospel
       being identified in you. When you see that you have passed from death unto Life and become a
       new creature in Christ Jesus, that’s the identity of the Holy Spirit. That’s exactly right. How can
       the Holy Spirit write the Bible and turn around and deny what He wrote? See, He cannot do it.
       He’s… That’s—that’s the identity of unbelief. That’s the identity of unbelief. But the identity of
       belief, Jesus said, “These signs shall identify those who believe in me.” Now. We know that
       that’s God’s Own Word. All right.

       An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages - 9 - The Laodicean Church Age
       William Marrion Branham
       I want to make one more comparison between the Laodicean prophet-messenger and John,
       the prophet-messenger who preceded Jesus’ first coming. The people in John’s day mistook
       him for the Messiah. John 1:19-20, “And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests
       and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? And he confessed, and denied not; but
       confessed, I am not the Christ.” Now this last-day prophet-messenger will have such power
       before the Lord that there will be those who mistake him for the Lord Jesus. (There will be a
       spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this. Matthew
       24:24-26, “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs
       and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have
       told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, He is in the desert; go not forth:
       behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe it not.”) But don’t you believe it. He is not Jesus
       Christ. He is not the Son of God. HE IS ONE OF THE BRETHREN, A PROPHET, A
       MESSENGER, A SERVANT OF GOD. He needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than
       that which John received when he was the voice that cried, “I am not He, BUT HE IS
       COMING AFTER ME.” Before we close this section on the messenger of the Laodicean Age,
       we must seriously consider these two thoughts. First, this age will have ONE ProphetMessenger. Revelation 10:7 says, “When he (singular) shall begin to sound.” There has never
       been an age where God gave His people two major prophets at one time. He gave Enoch
       (alone); He gave Noah (alone); He gave Moses (he alone had the Word though others
       prophesied); John the Baptist came ALONE.

       65-0219 - This Day This Scripture Is Fulfilled
       William Marrion Branham
       119 The hour that we’re living, this day this Scripture is fulfilled. This day the evening Lights
       have come, and we fail to see It. Notice. 120 John said, “This day I am ‘the voice of one crying
       in the wilderness,’ as said the prophet Isaiah. Prepare the way for the Lord!” 121 They didn’t
       understand it. Say, “Oh, you’re Jesus…you’re—you’re the Christ,” rather. 122 He said, “I am
       not the Christ.” He said, “I’m not worthy to loose His shoes. But,” he said, “He is standing
       among you, somewhere,” for he was sure that He would be there. He would be in his day,
       ’cause God told him he was to introduce the Messiah.
        Making our lives fit the word of God, to be excepted of him in this hour, should be all of our
       desire. Let’s see year hands, that it is all you desire? Just to be conformed to his very image, to
       please him and carry on his work. Let us pray!
        Prayer by, Robert Lambert:
       Oh Lord, the world is in a terrible state tonight father, reeling and rocking under fornication and
       adultery, thieves and robbing tonight, Lord. Oh, God how many wicked things, is coming up
       before you tonight. Lord and the world don’t know it, that they’re in for a terrible day! Lord,
       little does the people realize it, that there’s a whole coast of California and Oregon and
       Washington and up through there Lord, that’s ready to slip into the bottom of the ocean. Lord,
       
       36
       little does our government realize, that the hand writing is on the wall. Little do they realize it
       Lord, that you’re ready to pour out your wrath upon them. But oh Lord, I believe there is an
       elected Bride here in this country, that stay’s the hand of God for this hour off of America. Lord,
       we see how the land is drying up in the west and in the south. We see Lord how you said, there
       would be famine in the last day, not for bread alone but for hearing the word of God. All these
       things are coming to pass, depression ready to set in, famine Lord. Oh Lord, thou art ready to
       break the back of our nation. Lord Jesus we thank you, that we have found grace in your sight.
       We pray Lord, that thou would conform us to thy very image, that you may get some use out of
       us on Earth. Lord we want to be on fire! Lord, I pray that you would forgive me for the hardness
       of my heart. God, I pray Lord, no matter how wicked the people are and how indifferent they are
       in this country, massage my heart Lord. Give me a fresh burden for souls that I had years ago, for
       the people in this country. When I went from door to door, for hours and hours and days Lord,
       weeping and crying and trying to win a soul and didn’t win any Lord! Oh God I pray, that you
       would give us a burden for the lost and the dying. And Lord just to think of how many wonderful
       little babies and children that’s in California. How many nice mothers and daddy’s. And yet
       Lord, we may get up in the morning and running outside to see what happen. For Lord, we we’re
       knocked out of our bed and the windows we’re broken and we rushed out to see what it was. And
       then found out that California has slipped into the ocean. Lord, tidal waves 500 to 600-foot-high
       maybe, moving at hundreds and hundreds of miles an hour Lord! Oh God, how can the Islands
       withstand such a terrible impact Lord. Oh God! Lord, we come to church and go back home and
       things get so common Lord, that we forget about this terrible day we’re living in! Oh Lord, help
       us God. Help us Lord to fear and to tremble to be living here in this country at this time, when
       every tall building shall come crumbling to the ground, Lord. Every bridge Lord, that goes across
       a river, Lord will come crumbling down. Lord, such catastrophic of such Mammoth proportions,
       that we cannot hardly imagine how great it will be. Oh Lord, help us! Help us God, to walk soft
       before you, Lord. Help us to fear thy great name. Lord Jesus, Lord just give us more grace and
       strength, that we may be more like you. We want to be on fire, we want our flame to burn even
       Lord. Oh help us, won’t you Lord? Bless every person that was here tonight. Pour out the Holy
       Spirit upon this little congregation and start a revival here, that will shake New England, Lord.
       We ask it in Jesus name, amen.

       build housing and put up tents.” But oh my, there’ll be no Golden Gate Bridge. There’ll be no

       mommies and daddies, will go plunging down in an instant to a watery grave. And California

       people that’s there today. Good little boys, like my little daughter, my little boy, see. Think about

       65-1204 - The Rapture
       William Marrion Branham
       190 That same Son stood there, one day. He said, "Lazarus, come forth." And a man that
       been dead four days, rotten, his nose fell in, stunk, he came forth. Said: Marvel not at this: for
       the hour is coming, amen, when all that's in the grave will hear the voice of the Son of God,
       So, it's done been spoke. It has to happen like that. There's going to be a Rapture. Oh, my! 191 I
       remember, just my last Message in California, where I thought I'd never go back again, when
       I predicted, "Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean. THUS SAITH THE LORD." It will. She
       is done. She is washed. She is finished. What hour? I don't know when, but it will be sunk.
       Right after that, the earthquakes begin to jolt and bow. 192 Remember, many of you men
       standing right there, that rock, that day when that Angel came down there. And that Light and
       Fire falling from the Heaven, around the rock where we were standing there. Rocks flang out of
       the mountains, and falling across there. She blasted three times, hard. I said, "Judgment will
       strike the West Coast." Two days after that, Alaska almost sunk. 193 Remember, that same God
       that said that, said, "Los Angeles is doomed." And she is finished. I don't know when. I can't
       tell you. 194 I didn't know I said that. But this brother here, I believe it was… No. One of the
       Mosely's, I believe, had me out on a street out there. I didn't know what it was till I looked back.
       I looked back in Scripture. And Jesus said, "Capernaum, Capernaum, how oft… You that's
       exalted yourself, rather, up into Heaven, shall be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works
       that been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it'd a stood today." And about a hundred and
       fifty years from there, (Sodom had already, in the earth) then Capernaum is in the water, too,
       today. 195 And that same Spirit of God that said all these things, and done all these things, It
       said there, "Oh, city, Capernaum, who called yourself by the name of the Angels, Los Angeles,
       how you've exalted yourself into heaven! The very root and seat of Satan, see, you've exalted
       yourself." 196 Preachers, it's a graveyard for them. Good men go there and die like rats. What
       havoc! 197 "You that call yourself by the name of the Angels; if the mighty works had been done
       in Sodom, that been done in you, it'd stood today. But your hour has come."
        Oh, now think friend, you and I have a chance to serve the Lord with all of our hearts and
       with all of our souls and with all of our might.
        Now this will happen. Multitudes of millions, and what’s it gonna do? It’s gonna break the
       back of United States. California is the breadbasket for United States in the winter. All your
       vegetables and fruit come out of California, they’ll be no more. The economy if you think it’s
       bad now, what will it be then. See, oh friend. To think of all these things, are ready to take place.
        But you and I, it’s too late then, we’ve got to get ready now! Not wait for that to roll around,
       but while it’s tarrying, now the time to get ready. How many want to be ready, with all your
       heart? Would it not be a blessed thing, if you we’re down on your knees praying the night that
       California slips in, or today. And that you we’re prayed up, the very day that it happened and it
       would make you feel good, wouldn’t it? Supposing you we’re down to the movies? Or supposing
       you we’re so backslid, that you we’re sitting in front of the Television set. I guarantee you, that
       
       38
       the Television will have no interest to you at all, at that time. Oh, you’ll scream and cry to find
       the Lord. It will be just like the Bible said, “There’ll be an hour that you’ll seek me, and I’ll not
       be found. Seek the Lord Jesus, while he may be found. Because, as I said year and years ago,
       “There’ll come an hour when all will seek for Christ and not be able to find him.
       Proverbs 1:26-29-Reference quote:
       26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
       27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when
       distress and anguish cometh upon you.
       28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall
       not find me:
       29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:
        Now, you pick up this magazine it’s Jesus, turn on the radio it’s Jesus, I don’t care what you
       hear. People are so shook up now it’s nothing but, Jesus Jesus Jesus. But if you would tell them
       who Jesus is that he’s the word, they wouldn’t want him.
        Let’s sing this blessed song here. Let’s stand to our feet and rest ourselves.
       Congregation sings: “There is a fountain filled with Blood”
        That was a fine song in its day, I love it very dearly. But we don’t believe we’re gonna lie
       silent in the grave. We’re gonna be, “Changed, in a moment and in a twinkling of an eye and
       forever we shall be with the Lord.” Aren’t you glad? (Amen)
       1 Corinthians 15:52-Reference quote:

       1 Thessalonians 4:17-Reference quote:
       17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to
       meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
        If that ain’t the spookiest horrible'ist thing, that I have to go over there and look at that poor
       neighbor in the casket. I feared it ever since I was a little boy. And that right quick back in my
       childhood, a terrible thing.
        A little young fella I used to play with, we went into the service when we were sixteen years
       old. We went into the service together, when we we’re sixteen. And we got separated there and
       he went to California and I went to Florida. And then I come out and went home, and he was
       coming home on a furlough, him and is brother. They went over a mountain in California and
       killed themselves. They had their bodies there and that was the first death that I had in our home
       town where I lived, in the lower end of my town. And oh my, I knew I had to go. I had to go over
       there and see them boys. And oh, how I dreaded it, but I had to go. And oh my, just every step
       was just terrible. And finally, I got up there and there they laid. And oh, did it scare me! It
       haunted me for I don’t know for how long. To think oh my, that might be me any time! And just
       to think, “Just in a little bit, there they are go down in the ground and you hear that dirt goin over
       them” Oh my, it’s just a nightmare.
        And oh my, it’s the first thing I think of when I got saved. Oh my, that took the fear out of it!
       “This poor lisping stammering tongue, lies silent in the grave.” I ain’t goin to the grave.
       
       39
        We’ve been blessed to be living in the end time. There’ll be no preachers say over us, “Ashes
       to ashes and dust to dust” And then there goes the dirt, there won’t be none of that. But we’ll be
       changed, in a moment and in a twinkling of an eye. Think about it! You’ll not have no funeral.
       How many is glad to be living in this hour? (Amen) Oh, I’m so thankful, see just to be changed.
       Oh my, ain’t that wonderful?
        Well, I love the Lord with all my heart. How many are thankful, for what he done for you?
       (Amen) help us to please the Lord.
        Now, if you’ll be seated. Now tonight, is the first Sunday and another month. And we always
       have communion on that first Sunday.
        Now if there’s anyone here any people here that you don’t want to have communion, like
       some people feel like they shouldn’t take it and you want to slip out and go on home, feel
       perfectly free to do so. But all that want to have communion with us, we’ll have communion.
       And we don’t serve communion like they do down here, these churches down the street. We
       serve it just like it says, in your Bible. It says in the Bible that Jesus poured wine into one cup,
       one cup!
        Some people say, “Oh my, I just couldn’t take communion there, because what if somebody
       there has got a germ? And then I would drink from that cup and I would get that germ and I’d be
       sick.” Well, the only thing I can say is, I’d like to recommend you to Jesus the healer. He said,
       “By his strips you we’re healed.” See!
        Like one of my neighbors said, “When he comes spring and it gets warm Brother Lambert, I
       want you to Baptize me.” I said, “We break the ice! Sometimes its pretty thick.” She said, “But
       I’d catch pneumonia!” I said, “I’ve never heard of anybody ever even catching a cold.”
        I know of one woman, that tuberculosis TB and was squirting blood out of both lungs. They
       took her down in the water, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and broke the ice and she rode
       in the back of a truck home. She was healed!
        Just depends on how you look at it. How many rather take God at his word? (Amen) I don’t
       know how many right here, have been baptized right in the dead of the winter. One little sister, a
       very weak sister and I think she was even carrying a baby and the doctors didn’t even know if
       she was gonna carry that. And her husband an unbeliever and jumped in there and cut through
       ice I don’t know how many inches thick, about 14 inches and baptized her right in that cold
       water. And she’s healthy right today.
        So, we take communion out of one cup. Now, if all those that are here now want to take
       communion with us we’re gonna change our service now. I’m gonna read…I usually read the
       same scripture found over in Matthew if you want to read it.
       And why do we take communion? Because God said, to! God said, to!
        We don’t believe in taking it like the Catholic’s though. We don’t believe it’s the Holy Ghost.
       And when they read the Bible it says, “When the day of Pentecost was fully come, there comes a
       priest up there with the wafer on the tray said lick out your tongue? No, No!
        “There came a sound from heaven, like a rushing mighty wind.” Communion is one thing and
       the Baptism of the Holy Ghost is something else.
       Acts 2:2-Reference quote:
       And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
       2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all
       the house where they were sitting.
       3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
       
       40
       4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the
       Spirit gave them utterance.
        Let’s see here. Now if our sisters would just play real softly, something like a real blood song.
       I like them good ole blood songs for communion, don’t you? I’m so thankful, for the blood of the
       Lord Jesus. Children, we don’t ever want to let communion get common. Realize, what a sacred
       thing it is. God made flesh and died. The Bible said, “Cursed is every man that hangeth on a
       tree.”
       Galatians 3:13-Reference quote:
       13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written,
       Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:
       Deuteronomy 21:23-Reference quote:
       23 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day;
       (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God
       giveth thee for an inheritance.
       The law said in Galatians, curseth is a man that hangeth on a tree. And Jesus was hung on a tree
       and was made a curse for you and I. He who knew no sin, became sin for you and I. That we
       might become his holiness and his righteousness.
        Therefore, we come to the communion table, sanely and sincerely respectful and fearful. And
       we come to take of this communion the Lords supper, the bread and the wine as a token or a
       symbol of his death that he died to purchase our salvation. So therefore, we want to be sincere in
       what we’re doing.
        So therefore, you ought to be living a life of a Christian. And you know what it’s spoke of to
       be. So, people out here in the world see you living like the world and doing things that you
       shouldn’t do. Then they see you come up and take communion then they think, there’s no
       sincerity there. The Bible said, “See that you don’t take it in a unworthy manner. For many are
       sick among you because they don’t discern the Lords body. But we should be living a Christian
       life, separated from the world.
       1 Corinthians 11:29,30-Reference quote:
       29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not
       discerning the Lord's body.
       30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
       I’m not saying you should be perfect, I’m not saying nothing like that. But be living clean before
       the Lord. Then you come up and take communion, by Faith. By Faith, you take communion the
       bread and the wine that the Lord God has forgiven you of all your sins.
        Now, let’s just bow our heads a minute. Now Paul said, before you take communion, pray for
       one another. If you know somebody that’s maybe having a hard time serving the Lord, one that
       is a little weak. This is the time to pray for your brother or sister.
       
       41
       James 5:16-Reference quote:
       15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have
       committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
       16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The
       effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
        If you got ought against your brother or sister, now is the time to get it out of your heart. If
       you have anything in your life, that you want to make right with the Lord Jesus now, now’s the
       time to do it. We’ll just give you a few seconds before the Lord, to pray silently in your heart.
       I’m going pray myself and I’m gonna pray for you. Now, let’s all bow our heads and close our
       eyes.
        Dear Lord Jesus, I’m so thankful for our little storefront building, that you’ve given us. We’re
       thankful for this place that we’ve dedicated to the preaching of thy word. A place Lord, where
       we can preach the gospel, that the people can hear the word and be cleansed by the washing of
       the water by the word, Lord. We’re so thankful for thy blood, the bleeding word of God that
       cleanses us Lord. We thank you father, for saving our wicked souls and thank you for all that you
       have done for us. Lord help us, to love one another more, help us father God! We pray for each
       and every one that’s setting here tonight. God bless them! Lord may the hour arise soon, that
       you’ll pour out the great holy spirit in their souls. Fill them Lord, till they’re cup runneth over.
       Lord bless us all together father. Forgive us Lord of all of all of our secret faults, that we don’t
       know that we have, all the things that we do wrong Lord, forgive us father! And help us Lord to
       be more yielded to thee, that you could speak to us and tell us the things that we might be doing
       wrong, that we don’t know of. It’s so easy Lord, to see other people’s faults and so hard to see
       our own. Lord, forgive us and help us! Help us to be patient with one another, for we love
       everyone Lord. We don’t want to see no one, living a life they shouldn’t live. For we know Lord,
       that you called us and you saved us once and for all and we’ll be with thee forever. Now Lord
       bless each and everyone in the communion tonight. In Jesus Name, amen.
        Now, if our Brothers will come forward. We’ll start right on this side four at a time, right here
       in the front.
        Now reading from Matthew the 26th chapter.
       “And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the
       disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body”	
                 Now, if you’ll bow your heads.
       Dear heavenly father, I have here in my hands Lord, unleavened bread Lord. And Lord you said,
       there shall be no leaven found among us. For a little leaven, leaveneth the whole lump. Purge out
       there forth the leaven that you may be a new lump, saith the Lord. Father God we pray that all
       sin may be removed from us Lord. Cleanse us Lord! We pray that you’ll bless and sanctify this
       communion bread, that was baked by sanctified hands of a precious godly sister. Bless this bread
       Lord and sanctify it. Because we realize it represents your body, which was bruised and broken
       for us. Not a bone was broken Lord, but your flesh was beat and bruised and broken. God we’re
       so thankful for your body, for your suffering for the stripes that were laid upon your back. We
       thank you and praise you, for what you have done for us. We pray that you’ll bless every one,
       that partakes of this bread. If they are sick Lord, heal them Lord, give them strength and grace to
       be what you called them to be. In Jesus name, amen.
       
       42
       Exodus 12:19-Reference quote:
       19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is
       leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a
       stranger, or born in the land.
       Exodus 13:7-Reference quote:
       6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord. 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with
       thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
       According to the Hebrew lexicon Unleavened: Reference:
       “In the Bible, leaven is almost always symbolic of sin. Like leaven that permeates the whole
       lump of dough, sin will spread in a person, a church, or a nation, eventually overwhelming and
       bringing its participants into its bondage and eventually to death (Galatians 5:9-Romans 6:23)
       tell us that “the wages of sin is death,” which is God's judgment for sin, and this is the reason
       that Christ died—to provide a way out of this judgment for sin if man will repent of his sins,
       accept Christ as his Passover sacrifice, and have his heart changed so that he can conform his
       life to what God commands.”
                 “And he took the cup” One cup. Not little glasses, but one cup. “And he took the cup, and
       gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the New
       Covenant testament covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
       But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I
       drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom”
        Let us pray again.
       Oh, Lord God, here we have before us wine Lord. Which is a symbol of your blood. When the
       Roman soldier pierced thy side, out of thy side Lord flood blood. It was Gods own blood. It fell
       down upon the cross and spilt down upon the ground, so that the earth might be redeemed. For
       Lord, for we’re humans and all we know is about the earth. So, God you saved the earth, by your
       blood. You saved us, by your blood Lord. Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of
       sins.
       Lord, how the church world took out the blood. Oh, how we’re so thankful for the Old-Time
       Gospel! God bless this wine, sanctify it. And we’re thankful for thy blood that can cleanse us and
       wash us and make us white as snow. God every person that drinks this wine, heal them Lord,
       bless them father, give them strength Lord. In Jesus name, amen.
       Matthew 26:27-Reference quote:
       26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the
       disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
       27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
       28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
       29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I
       drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
       Congregation takes communion:
       
       43
        Let’s sing number 227. Do you love him with all your heart? (Amen)
       Congregation sings: “Under the Blood”
        Just give him a praise offering! Thank you for your blood and saving us! Lord how we thank
       you! How we, love you! Thank you father for saving our souls Lord God. We praise thee oh
       God! Thank thee for thy blood, Lord! Praise your holy name! Wonderful! Wonderful! The peace
       that abides in my heart.
        In an hour when the wrath of God is ready to belch across the world. We’re under the blood,
       we’re in Goshen, safe in Goshen. Realizing that she’s at the end of the road. Your neighbors and
       all of the relatives, are out from under the blood. Oh, how heartbreaking it is. But just what a
       peace that you have in your own heart, to know that you’re under that blood. As long as the
       blood is there you are safe. You’ll live for eternity and you’ll never die, oh what peace. In An
       hour when everybody, has signs on the walls and cars and windows and where ever you go,
       peace signs. A broken cross, a peace sign.
        And it’s so sad, a little boy was pumping gas in my car, a nice man. And there he had a great
       big peace sign and waring peace clothing, you know. Big great big peace sign, from his filling
       station. I was just getting ready to tell him, what that really meant. Did you realize, I was gonna
       say to him before he got away. I was gonna say, “Young man, do you realize why that you
       painted that sign? The Bible said, “That when they say peace, peace, peace, then sudden
       destruction.” And what’s getting ready to happen? Sudden destruction!”
       1Thessalonians 5:3-Reference quote:
       For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail
       upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.

       And Jesus said, “One word against it, it will never be forgiven to a man in this world or the
       world to come.” 36 What God does anyhow, whether the people receive it or not, the message
       has got to go on. They never received it then; they never received it in Noah’s time. They
       didn’t receive it in the days of the Lord Jesus, and they won’t do it today. That’s right. But it
       pleases the Father to give His warnings before judgment. What will Sodom say when they come
       up? When just Lot went through the streets… You say, “Just Lot?” The Bible said that their sins
       vexed his righteous soul daily. Sure he was. The Angels anointed him and sent him out with the
       Gospel. 37 Oh, brother, what a day that we’re living in. The Bible said in this day that (in
       Second Timothy) “The Spirit speaks expressively in the latter days they’ll depart from the faith,
       and will be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.” I come to the
       church the other night; it was altogether too snowy and bad to come here. But they had a
       basketball game, and they had to turn hundreds away. What is it? Their God is basketball. And
       what is your God then? A big blowed up piece of air. I’m glad that our God is the Lord Jesus
       Christ in His Person of His resurrection, a real living Creator Who made the heavens and earth.
       But they want to see that. The kind of spirit in them draws for that. The Spirit in a Christian
       draws him to Christ. “How can a man come to Me except My Father draws him.” 38 Oh, yes.
       Brother, I say this. Hurry, escape; you haven’t got much more time. These great big old
       
       44
       ecclesiastical walls are going to fall one of these days. You better run quickly while you got a
       chance. Get out of the world. Come into Christ. When you see the hot breath of judgment
       hanging on each side, now swinging eighteen hundred miles an hour around, or eighteen
       thousand miles an hour, around and around the world, and a sinful nation with their hand on
       a button that could send us all to powder in five minutes… Don’t look for something great to
       come, a great revival; you look for the coming of the Lord. Be ready now. The devil’s only
       blinding your eyes to these things. 39 Christ declared Hisself to every nation, and through every
       generation. He’s doing it today. The church nominal sets asleep. The church spiritual is awake.
       The sleeping virgin has went off to sleep, that’ll take the tribulation period. But the one that had
       oil in her lamp is ready. Blessed be the Name of the Lord.

       48 They had seen the great hand of God. They had saw all of His miracles, and then they had
       come under the sign of the Token. And while they were under the sign of the Token, they’ve taken
       the communion in—in desperation, for they knew at that time God was fixing to strike with
       judgment. 49 And it was a shaking time. It was a time where every man was examining
       himself, because the Word of the prophet had not failed one time. It had been proven to be
       true. Whatever he said, it happened just exactly the way he said it. The Pillar of Fire was still
       there. And, then, the prophet had announced that God would only pass over when He saw the
       token at the door. And it was a desperation.
       
        But here you are tonight, under the blood. You could be out there under that, but here you are
       to night under the blood. What? How? By God’s grace, he loved you and choose you out of all
       that. Because of his Grace! Oh, how you ought to be in Love with him!
        See, what he’s coming after, just a people that appreciate him and are in Love with him and
       our thanking him for his grace. Praising him with our lips! Living a life of just adoring him! And
       doing everything, just to please him. Oh God!
        Now we have foot washing. See, we do it all! Preachers don’t wash feet in their churches, no
       more. They say, “Well, the reason why we stopped now is, because some of the people have
       athlete’s feet and others don’t want to wash their feet.” Well, that’s true! We may as well, tell it
       all! And they got too much pride! They think well, we’re just so educated and you have a job
       down to the bank and your looked up to. And what if somebody come in and caught you down
       there washing somebody’s feet. Well, they would all make fun of me, tomorrow at my work. I
       don’t care who sees me down there, I don’t care what they say. Jesus said to do it! And I’m
       gonna do it! Jesus wasn’t ashamed to do it. He created the world and made you and I. And he got
       down before all the apostles and washed their feet. And he said, “If I and you call me Lord and
       master, if I washed your feet, then you ought to wash one another’s feet.”
        And he said to do it till he comes. How many want to do it? (Amen) I love it, myself! We
       have a wonderful time down in the basement, the brethren and I. And I’m sure the ladies do to.
       John 13:3-16-Reference quote:
       3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from
       God, and went to God;
       
       45
       4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
       5 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe
       them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
       6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
       7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know
       hereafter.
       8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not,
       thou hast no part with me.
       9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
       10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit:
       and ye are clean, but not all.
       11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
       12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he
       said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
       13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
       14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's
       feet.
       15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
       16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent
       greater than he that sent him.
        So now we’ll take the name of Jesus with you and be dismissed. And while our sisters play
       softly I’d like our brother to dismiss the congregation. If I don’t see you know more, I may see
       you Wednesday night or I may not. So, if you don’t see your pastor here Wednesday night, I’m
       on my way to Jeffersonville, Ind. The battle ground! And so, I really truthfully don’t want to go.
       I never want to go off and leave you, I want to stay here with you.
        I have one great goal and one heart’s desire, is to see God pour out his spirit. And bare me
       record, I go down with my name under it! God is gonna come from heaven, with a rushing
       mighty wind. Just exactly what happen on the day of Pentecost, is gonna happen again. How
       many believe it’s gonna be just that way? (Amen)
        So, won’t you try to live a life, that’s worthy of something like that to happen? Think about
       that as you go about your jobs this week. Try to live for that to happen, live for it! See! That’s
       the only thing that will bring Gods people together and we’ll get us out of here. So, may God
       help us all to labor for that great hour that’s coming.
        Now with our heads bowed and our eyes closed, I wonder if our elder brother here in the front
       Brother McGhee wouldn’t ask God’s blessing upon these dear people the congregation and then
       we’ll be dismissed and go to foot washing with God’s blessing.
